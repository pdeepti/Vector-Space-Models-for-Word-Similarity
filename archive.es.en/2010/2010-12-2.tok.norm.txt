a family 's seventh child automatically gets a bonus godfather - the german president .
but what happens when the family has extremist views ? for president christian wulff , a run-of-the-mill process honoring a slightly antiquated german custom has turned into something of a political minefield .
under a law established in 1949 , while germany sought to replenish its population and workforce after world war ii , a family 's seventh child automatically has the right to a special bonus godfather - the german president .
this routine procedure , which also includes a 500 euro -lrb- $ 658 -rrb- reward , applies to any seventh child .
however , president wulff 's decision to honor the custom for an allegedly neo-nazi family in the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania has solicited strong opposition .
after a few days deliberating , wulff 's office issued a statement saying that the godfather decision ultimately concerned the newborn child , not the family or their political background . " it 's everyone 's responsibility to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up to adhere to democratic principles , " wulff also said .
local opposition the social minister for the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , manuela schwesig , said she was disappointed with wulff 's statement and that he should have more clearly distanced himself from the alleged political stance of the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local politicians advised against the honor because of the family 's far-right ties " instead of issuing a general appeal to everyone to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up according to democratic principles , it would have been more courageous to issue a direct challenge to the parents in this specific instance , " schwesig said on thursday .
regional politicians on all sides have said that the family in question was closely tied to the far-right scene in germany .
extremism experts in germany have said they were friends of the high-profile lawyer and member of the far-right npd party , juergen rieger , who died in 2009 .
the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- said the mother was a member of an organization with close ties to the npd whose name roughly translates as " the ring of national women . "
" we ca n't fight against far-right culture in our schools and local projects and then give out state honors to such people , " the local authorities in krakow am see , responsible for the family 's hometown of lalendorf , said in a statement .
a truly extended family the german president is set to travel to the region on thursday on unrelated business , although it seems unlikely he would visit his controversial new godchild , who is but one of many .
german heads of state have been honorary godfathers to 76,440 children since the law 's inception in 1949 .
parents can apply for the honor - which is usually a formality - as soon as their seventh babe is born .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 02.12.2010 scandal overshadows fifa executive committee as world cup votes loom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu and temarii wo n't get to vote on thursday as the vote to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 soccer world cups approaches , multiple accusations of bribery hang over the men doing the voting . world soccer 's governing body , fifa , is set to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 world cups on thursday .
it 's the first time the executive committee - who cast their votes to determine the outcome - has ever been asked to pick two world cup venues in one session .
however , the committee 's numbers have already been thinned out due to one corruption scandal , and others are still hanging over fifa 's head , threatening to spoil the party for the zurich-based organization .
here 's a rundown of the stories fifa would like to disappear on world cup selection day : cash for votes description : executive committee members reynald temarii and amos adamu were filmed offering pledges to vote for the united states ' 2022 bid in exchange for financial considerations .
temarii , a tahitian who represents the oceania football confederation -lrb- ofc -rrb- on the committee , asked men whom he believed were representatives of the us bid - but who were actually reporters working for the sunday times of london - for 3 million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.7 million euros , 2.3 million us dollars -rrb- so he could build a soccer academy in auckland .
confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- representative adamu requested 800,000 us dollars -lrb- 610,000 euros -rrb- - half paid in advance - in order to lay four artificial football pitches in his home country , nigeria .
sanction : temarii was suspended from football for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- , adamu barred for three years and fined 10,000 francs .
significance : high , in that it means two less people voting on thursday , altering the formula for garnering enough committee votes to win the right to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teixeira was once investigated by brazil 's senate isl 's secret payments description : issa hayatou , the cameroonian head of caf , brazil 's ricardo teixeira , and paraguay 's nicolas leoz , the head of south american confederation conmebol , have been accused of accepting bribes during the 1990s from the now-defunct sports marketing firm isl .
the bbc news magazine program " panorama " and swiss newspaper tages-anzeiger have said say they possess isl documents that show hayatou was paid 100,000 french francs -lrb- 15,200 euros -rrb- , leoz was paid $ 730,000 , and teixeira was paid $ 9.5 million via a shell company in liechtenstein .
sanction : none as yet .
fifa considers accusations related to its former media rights partner isl to be closed , but the international olympic committee , where hayatou is also a board member , may see things differently .
significance : in the short run , the claims will probably do little but harm england 's chances of landing the 2018 cup .
if these three voters had been considering voting for england , they 're now unlikely to do so since the corruption allegations were aired by the bbc .
in the long run , they could prove critical in cleaning up fifa , should any kind of outside investigation go forward .
the alleged instances of wrongdoing are up to two decades old , but the sums of money are massive - a ledger of similar payments made by isl - whose recipients remain unknown - total over 100 million us dollars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time warner is in trouble ticketgate description : trinidad and tobago 's jack warner , a fifa vice president and the head of concacaf - the confederation of caribbean , north and central american football - has been accused of again breaking fifa rules regulating the resale of word cup tickets .
" panorama , " along with the danish sporting newspaper tipsbladet , reported that warner bought more than 84,000 us dollars worth of tickets to the world cup in south africa so as to re-sell them to scalpers .
sanction : none as yet .
but since warner was caught doing much the same thing during the 2006 world cup in germany - and fined by fifa for it - he may be punished again .
significance : potentially great .
warner is believed to exert great influence over the way his concacaf colleagues chuck blazer -lrb- usa -rrb- and rafael salguero -lrb- guatemala -rrb- will vote , and thus has been courted assiduously by a number of 2018 bids .
the bbc program may have been enough of an embarrassment to move those three votes away from england and toward russia or spain / portugal .
the effect on the vote for the 2022 host is less significant as the three men are expected to favor the us , the only bid from within concacaf 's ranks .
longer-term , warner is thought to be a major power broker in the 2011 race for the fifa presidency , likely to pit incumbent sepp blatter against qatar 's mohamed bin hammam .
if warner were to be suspended , that race could be blown wide open .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "

meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .

" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .

dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

that bothered one berlin resident so much that he took his favorite flicks and founded a festival . bernhard karl is a collector .
every year , he travels to up to 10 film festivals around the world and comes home with the ones he likes the best . and he 's stubborn .
when karl , a trained theater director , was looking for a new job , he knew he did n't have a chance at establishments like the berlin international film festival , so he went and started his own : around the world in 14 films is now in its fifth year . " the imaginary trip around the world is , so to speak , my life , " karl told deutsche welle .
he comes from a small village in bavaria and always felt a sense of wanderlust . it irked him that none of the wonderful films he saw at international festivals were shown in german cinemas .
" so i collected them and created a kind of imaginary world map , " he said . bildunterschrift : " benda bilili ! " tells the true success story of congolese street musicians a different look at africa through december 4 , this " world map " is available to berlin movie-goers .
the 14 starring films - from romania , thailand , turkey , mexico and elsewhere - are all making their german premiere . " there are tons of new impressions and new horizons , " said karl .
" that can be difficult and sometimes it can hurt . " the documentary " benda bilili ! , " about homeless , wheelchair-bound people and street kids in kinshasa , is one that does n't necessarily hurt , but certainly offers new perspectives for german audiences .
while the setting sounds depressing , the protagonists do n't stand for poverty and suffering in africa , but for optimism and vitality . the film 's namesake , staff benda bilili , are musicians who have become more and more successful , even landing gigs at huge festivals in europe .
in 2009 , they won the artist award for world music at the world music expo in copenhagen and have been labeled dr congo 's " buena vista social club . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernard karl wanted german audiences to enjoy his favorite international films up close and personal in berlin french documentary filmmaker florent de la tullaye is behind this fresh look at dr congo .
" the people in africa get european television stations and only see reports of suffering and catastrophes about their country , " he said .
" but they do n't see themselves in those reports .
they 're proud of their music and their musicians - and that was the key to this film . " " benda bilili ! " was the opening film in one of the out-of-competition series at this year 's cannes film festival , where it was celebrated with standing ovations .
for de la tullaye , the smaller festival around the world in 14 films is n't any less important than star-studded cannes . " the advantage is that at smaller festivals the films are a lot more accessible to the audience than at a big , over-loaded festival , " said the director . other highlights at this year 's around the world in 14 days include a three-hour documentary about romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu , by andrei ujica , and " the green wave , " a collage of animated and documentary films about iran 's so-called green revolution . author : nadine wojcik -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .
the study also revealed a more prevalent anti-jewish undercurrent in germany than in other western european countries .
a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are critical of women 's rights in islam while 50 percent of danes and two-thirds of the french and dutch respondents approved of the building of mosques , fewer than 30 percent of germans said they did .
in denmark , france and the netherlands , a clear majority of respondents viewed muslims positively .
in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .
juergen klopp 's team has dropped a total of 4 points on the season thus far and have won five straight .
no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .
home advantage would usually count for something but with bvb on such a roll , it 's unlikely anything will help .
prediction : 3-0 dortmund .

the world health organization has stepped up its research . global warming – and the consequent change in weather and rainfall patterns – is complicating matters for the world health organization in its fight against malaria in asia . the countries which are most at risk in the asia-pacific region are india , myanmar , bangladesh and indonesia . according to world health organization figures , two million people are at risk of contracting the illness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 02.12.2010 germany to focus on european space missions , abandon national moon plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is giving up its national sights on the moon despite a tight budget , germany aims to increase investment in space science and technology to fuel innovation and growth through the auspices of the european space agency rather than its own national space program . the german government said this week it would step up public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .
" we 've always had more good ideas than we 've had money and it will probably stay that way in the future .
besides , it would be sad if we lost our imagination . "

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

critics say the kimberley process , which aims to certify the origin of rough diamonds , is failing .
by tolerating non-compliant states , ' blood diamond ' trade is endorsed , not stopped .
but should the process be abandoned ? for the last 10 years , the kimberley process certification scheme , or kp , has been considered one of the most successful international tripartite agreements between industry , government and civil society .
it aims to prevent conflict or " blood " diamonds from entering the legitimate diamond trade by a certification system that traces each gem back to its mine of origin .
over 75 percent of the world 's diamond producing , trading and manufacturing countries participate in the scheme .
so far , the kp claims , its approach has been successful .
for example , sierra leone , which was known for its bloody diamond wars of the 1990s , now exports millions of dollars worth of diamonds legally each year , which the kp boasts has helped develop the fragile state . but kp member zimbabwe has been trading uncertified diamonds in large quantities amid reports of human rights violations of miners at the hands of government forces .
now , the failure of the kp to pull zimbabwe into line has called into question the credibility and legitimacy of the process as the world 's diamond-trade watchdog .
' a vehicle with three flat tires ' ian smillie , a founder of the kimberley process , left his post last year due to frustrations with the process ' structure .
" i think the kp is failing , but i do n't think it has failed yet .
i refer to it as a vehicle with three flat tires , " smillie told deutsche welle .
" the problem is that it has literally allowed countries to get away with murder and not say anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marange mines were the site of a 2008 massacre the kimberley process has 49 members , representing 75 countries , with the european community and its member states counting as an individual participant .
kp members account for approximately 99.8 percent of the global production of rough diamonds .
kp members must meet minimum requirements in order to certify shipments of rough diamonds as " conflict-free . "
these include import and export controls , as well as a commitment to transparency .
the scheme is meant to prevent " blood diamonds , " which are used by rebel movements to finance conflict against legitimate governments , from entering the legitimate trade .
but according to smillie , the problem is that while the kimberley process is in the business of conflict prevention , it has failed to keep up with the times .
today , the trade in conflict diamonds is no longer run by rebel groups , but is institutionalized by legitimate governments , as is the case in zimbabwe .
" the problem is that the kp did n't keep up with the criminals , " he said .
" it did not allow for human rights violations . "
the question of zimbabwe dominated the kimberley process plenary meeting in jerusalem last month .
civil societies like human rights watch and fatal transactions want the kp to stand strong and enforce human rights provisions in agreement with member countries , with the possibility of suspending zimbabwe from the kp .
but not all members agreed .
smillie blamed the flawed voting system of the kp for allowing noncompliant countries like venezuela and zimbabwe to remain in the scheme .
currently , measures require an absolute consensus to pass .
countries with poor human-rights records - including china , russia and south africa - are reluctant to punish zimbabwe with suspension , he said .
the marange fields have attracted both south african and chinese investors .
" that 's how these countries have been protected , " he said .
" the process needs to be reformed so that the kp can start getting tough . "
the kp 's rogue state , zimbabwe since zimbabwe 's 2008 massacre , in which state security forces machine-gunned 200 miners to the ground from helicopters in order to claim the lucrative marange diamond fields in chiadzwa in the southeast , the kimberley process has attempted to monitor and restrict the sale of rough diamonds from the region .
a joint work plan was established , and minimum standards agreed between the kp and zimbabwean government .
however , at the plenary meeting in jerusalem , the kp and zimbabwean government reached an impasse .
marie mueller from fatal transactions , an ngo umbrella group based in bonn , germany , attended the meeting as a member of the kimberley process ' civil society coalition .
she said the negotiations were disappointing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe mines minister mpofu , far left , says his country is compliant " there is no result yet , as there was a deadlock at the end of the meeting , " she said .
" so behind backdoors , it seems negotiations are going on , but this is difficult to assess . "
while zimbabwe 's mining minister obert mpofu claimed that the country has " complied fully " with kp requirements , external investigations reveal human rights violations including beatings , rape and torture occur on the marange diamond fields .
members of the kp civil society coalition are also calling on zimbabwe to endorse local civil society monitoring mechanisms and to allow ngos to report on the kp conditions in marange .
human rights abuses continue human rights watch reports that the marange fields have become a military stronghold , with state security agents running their own illegal mining syndicates .
these cartels are responsible for the exploitation of illegal miners , many of whom are children , as well as harassment and violence towards local communities .
villagers are often displaced from their homes without adequate compensation .
the diamonds that are mined illegally in marange are then smuggled through mozambique , a non-kp member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the kp deliberates over zimbabwe , illegal diamonds will be traded .
according to shamiso mtisi , the local focal-point coordinator appointed by the kimberley process to monitor human rights abuses on the ground in zimbabwe , civil society is subject to threats and harassment by state security agents .
members of his staff are even afraid to continue their work , he said .
mtisi attended the jerusalem plenary meeting , but his position was not recognized by the zimbabwean government .
mtisi told deutsche welle that state agents threatened him before attending the conference .
" the government of zimbabwe needs to demilitarize the mining fields , " mtisi said .
" they also need to put in place a framework for small-scale miners and villagers , so that the local community can benefit . "
during the jerusalem meeting , the zimbabwean government made it clear that it would continue trading rough diamonds with or without the consent of the kp , with mining minister mpofu declaring : " zimbabwe will sell diamonds without any conditions . "
a $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 920 million euro -rrb- diamond deal between the zimbabwean government and indian sourcing consortium surat rough diamond sourcing india ltd will go ahead .
in exchange , the gujarat based traders will train 1,000 young zimbabweans in cutting and polishing diamonds .
evolution versus revolution ?
the world diamond council , which represents diamond manufacturing and trading companies and is a supporter of the kimberley process , says " evolution " is the key to the future of the kp .
it suggests implementing a stronger administrative body , as well as modifying the voting system .
instead of the current absolute consensus vote , the council advises a super-majority vote , such as a two-thirds or 75 percent majority rule , to limit the ability of minorities to derail agreements .
even detractors like smillie still have hope for the kimberley process .
" as long as it exists , there is still hope , " he said .
but he is quick to point out that while negotiations with zimbabwe continue , so too will the sale of conflict diamonds .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region .

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .
the study also revealed a more prevalent anti-jewish undercurrent in germany than in other western european countries .
a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are critical of women 's rights in islam while 50 percent of danes and two-thirds of the french and dutch respondents approved of the building of mosques , fewer than 30 percent of germans said they did .
in denmark , france and the netherlands , a clear majority of respondents viewed muslims positively .
in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .

instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

the future of a legally binding un agreement to cut emissions is looking less certain . japan has said that it does not plan to sign up to the next commitment period of the kyoto protocol unless it includes binding emissions cuts for other big polluters like the united states and china .
" it does not make sense to set the second commitment period under the kyoto protocol as the current kyoto protocol is imposing obligations on only a small part of developed countries , " japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa told reporters in cancun .
he said a broader deal was needed as kyoto only applied to rich countries .
the united states abandoned the treaty in 2001 , while china is spared legally binding commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions because it is classified as a developing country .
under kyoto , rich nations must cut their emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
however , these parties only account for less than a third of the world 's emissions .
the first commitment period of the protocol expires in 2012 , and delegates to the climate talks in cancun are under pressure to determine what happens thereafter .
threat of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minamikawa says extending kyoto ' does not make sense ' developing countries said that climate talks in mexico would fail unless tokyo backed down on its plan to abandon the un climate pact .
" there will be no successful outcome for cancun , " if japan sticks to its refusal to extend cuts under kyoto , said abdulla alsaidi , the chair of the group of 77 and china , the main body of developing nations at the two-week talks in mexico .
the un talks are essentially taking place on two tracks , with linkages .
one track gathers all 194 parties under the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , including the united states , on worldwide action beyond 2012 .
the other track gathers the 193 parties to the kyoto protocol - all countries except the united states .
developing countries have said they will commit to a deal in the first track provided there is a deal for renewing kyoto , the japanese city where the protocol was signed in 1997 .
as a result , if japan and other rich countries bale out of kyoto , that could bring the rest of the talks to a standstill .
un climate chief christiana figueres said japan had made similar statements in the past and warned all sides that a clear decision on kyoto 's fate was not expected to be taken in cancun .
" given the diversity of positions on the kyoto protocol , it is not going to be possible for cancun to take a radical decision one way or another on the kyoto protocol , " she said .
that means even less time to agree on what happens to kyoto before 2012 .
not all bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are low expectation about what delegates can achieve at cancun in addition to kyoto , protecting the planet 's forests is high on the agenda at cancun as forest destruction is responsible for up to 17 percent of mankind 's greenhouse gas emissions .
google unveiled technology on thursday which it said would help build trust between rich and poor countries on projects designed to protect the world 's tropical forests .
measuring the success of forest-protection plans in places like the amazon , indonesia and the congo basin has always been difficult because tree disease , corruption and illegal logging threaten vast remote areas that scientists ca n't monitor by land .
global deals among nations to protect forests have been slowed by the lack of transparency .
negotiators at the climate talks believe progress can be made on a global plan called reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation -lrb- redd -rrb- in which rich countries would fund rewards for developing and poor nations like brazil , indonesia and several in africa , such as rwanda , that save and restore forests .
google said it hoped its tool would help speed cooperation in redd , which could lead to further global agreements on climate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 02.12.2010 unlucky number seven causes headache for german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1949 law wanted to see germany 's population blossom like many religions , germany encourages its citizens to go forth and multiply .
a family 's seventh child automatically gets a bonus godfather - the german president .
but what happens when the family has extremist views ? for president christian wulff , a run-of-the-mill process honoring a slightly antiquated german custom has turned into something of a political minefield .
under a law established in 1949 , while germany sought to replenish its population and workforce after world war ii , a family 's seventh child automatically has the right to a special bonus godfather - the german president .
this routine procedure , which also includes a 500 euro -lrb- $ 658 -rrb- reward , applies to any seventh child .
however , president wulff 's decision to honor the custom for an allegedly neo-nazi family in the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania has solicited strong opposition .
after a few days deliberating , wulff 's office issued a statement saying that the godfather decision ultimately concerned the newborn child , not the family or their political background . " it 's everyone 's responsibility to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up to adhere to democratic principles , " wulff also said .
local opposition the social minister for the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , manuela schwesig , said she was disappointed with wulff 's statement and that he should have more clearly distanced himself from the alleged political stance of the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local politicians advised against the honor because of the family 's far-right ties " instead of issuing a general appeal to everyone to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up according to democratic principles , it would have been more courageous to issue a direct challenge to the parents in this specific instance , " schwesig said on thursday .
regional politicians on all sides have said that the family in question was closely tied to the far-right scene in germany .
extremism experts in germany have said they were friends of the high-profile lawyer and member of the far-right npd party , juergen rieger , who died in 2009 .
the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- said the mother was a member of an organization with close ties to the npd whose name roughly translates as " the ring of national women . "
" we ca n't fight against far-right culture in our schools and local projects and then give out state honors to such people , " the local authorities in krakow am see , responsible for the family 's hometown of lalendorf , said in a statement .
a truly extended family the german president is set to travel to the region on thursday on unrelated business , although it seems unlikely he would visit his controversial new godchild , who is but one of many .
german heads of state have been honorary godfathers to 76,440 children since the law 's inception in 1949 .
parents can apply for the honor - which is usually a formality - as soon as their seventh babe is born .

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .
" we 've always had more good ideas than we 've had money and it will probably stay that way in the future .
besides , it would be sad if we lost our imagination . "

the world health organization has stepped up its research . global warming – and the consequent change in weather and rainfall patterns – is complicating matters for the world health organization in its fight against malaria in asia . the countries which are most at risk in the asia-pacific region are india , myanmar , bangladesh and indonesia . according to world health organization figures , two million people are at risk of contracting the illness .

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .
juergen klopp 's team has dropped a total of 4 points on the season thus far and have won five straight .
no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .
home advantage would usually count for something but with bvb on such a roll , it 's unlikely anything will help .
prediction : 3-0 dortmund .

the two may have also used a racy find to extort a young star . two young men in germany are being investigated for hacking the computers of pop stars like justin timberlake , lady gaga , ke $ ha and kelly clarkson to obtain and then sell unreleased music files .
police have found evidence that the 17-year-old and 23-year-old from western germany used trojan viruses to infect computers associated with the singers , enabling them to download the files , confirmed ralf haferkamp of the duisburg prosecutor 's office in an interview with deutsche welle .
members of a kelly clarkson fan club became suspicious after the young men offered to sell them new and commercially unavailable songs via an online platform .
the club members contacted clarkson 's management , who in turn notified the police .
" the investigation could result in charges relating to commercial copyright violations , which carry a penalty of up to five years in jail , " haferkamp told deutsche welle .
" since one of the hackers is 17 years old , he could face a similar punishment in a detention center for young offenders . "
more than money at stake authorities estimate that the hackers may have pocketed up to five-figure revenues from selling the illegal files , but turning a quick profit appears not to have been their only motive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer ke $ ha is alleged to have given in to the hackers ' blackmail demands the two may face additional charges for obtaining a sex photo of one singer and blackmailing the star with the item in exchange for a public shoutout for a dj .
a racy photo of 23-year-old pop american pop star ke $ ha has since appeared on the website of a dj sharing the same stage one as one of the accused hackers .
internet tabloids and blogs have been following the alleged blackmail incident , but authorities handling the investigation are unable to confirm or deny the rumors that ke $ ha was the performer involved .
lady gaga 's laptop ?
the files stemmed from a variety of computers , including those belonging to managers and others close to the performers but not necessarily from the singers ' personal devices .
" i ca n't say whether the laptop sitting on lady gaga 's nightstand was among them , but i think that 's pretty unlikely , " haferkamp told the dpa news agency .
the hackers have already widely confessed to the charges , and authorities expect the investigation to continue until early next year .
for now , the two young men , who each live at home with their parents , are not in custody .

this includes mara radovanovic who oversees a woman 's shelter in bosnia . even 12-year-old girls from good families can end up forced into prostitution in bosnia .
first the pimps spy on a girl and figure out who in her family she loves the most .
then they tell her they 're going to kill that very person if she refuses to work as a prostitute for them .
that 's according to mara radovanovic of the women 's organization lara in bosnia , which is now supported by the international organization care .
radovanovic has established a network to fight human trafficking and set up a women 's shelter in a secret location where she cares for victims .
high-level johns other girls are drugged and then gang raped in motels .
the perpetrators film everything and then threaten to put the video on the internet .
the fear of public humiliation silences the girls .
radovanovic told deutsche welle that even supposed " leaders " of bosnian society are involved in these crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the men involved are in positions of power that was the case of one roma girl in her shelter , who comes from a village near the eastern town of srebrenica .
" she was abused by teachers and the local police , " radovanovic said .
" even the bosnian security minister was involved . "
the girl testified against the minister in the shelter , which has directly felt the results .
" in the past we got funding from the security ministry , but since then the support has stopped , " radovanovic said .
she said she did n't expect any more funds as long as that particular politician is in power .
he had claimed to have met with the girl to give her a scholarship for school .
because the girl has a photographic memory , she was able to describe all the details of the minister 's car to the police , thus proving that she really had been lured into his car , and not for educational purposes .
a new trend going after local bosnian girls is the new trend for organized crime in the region , according to radovanovic .
up until 2005 , most of the victims were foreign girls and women who were lured from across eastern europe by alleged job offers in the west .
instead of ending up working as a babysitter or waitress in germany , however , they were then carried off to the balkans and forced to work as prostitutes .
awareness efforts from a few brave activists have now brought this issue into the public consciousness .
today bosnian border guards and police officers are better trained to identify these trafficking victims , which also reduces the number of foreign victims in the country .
a risky fight victims of forced prostitution and human trafficking can only be help , radovanovic said , if the state intervenes .
" the most important thing is to force our government to provide the resources for the rehabilitation of these victims , " she said .
" school scholarships for example .
because otherwise they ca n't be helped in the long term . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia has those trying to help in their sights the bosnian government has one response : there 's no money available .
but radovanovic will keep fighting for the victims , she said , even though she 's besieged by threats from the bosnian mafia and it 's almost impossible to protect them .
radovanovic 's organization may have the support of european police forces and the organization for security and cooperation in europe , but she says silence is often what keeps her and her colleagues safe .
" the most important thing is the following : we know that the criminals are out there that would be very quick to kill someone , " she said .
" so even if we have evidence against someone , we keep this knowledge to ourselves .
knowledge is the best way for us to protect ourselves - anything else would mean certain death . "

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 02.12.2010 scandal overshadows fifa executive committee as world cup votes loom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu and temarii wo n't get to vote on thursday as the vote to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 soccer world cups approaches , multiple accusations of bribery hang over the men doing the voting . world soccer 's governing body , fifa , is set to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 world cups on thursday .
it 's the first time the executive committee - who cast their votes to determine the outcome - has ever been asked to pick two world cup venues in one session .
however , the committee 's numbers have already been thinned out due to one corruption scandal , and others are still hanging over fifa 's head , threatening to spoil the party for the zurich-based organization .
here 's a rundown of the stories fifa would like to disappear on world cup selection day : cash for votes description : executive committee members reynald temarii and amos adamu were filmed offering pledges to vote for the united states ' 2022 bid in exchange for financial considerations .
temarii , a tahitian who represents the oceania football confederation -lrb- ofc -rrb- on the committee , asked men whom he believed were representatives of the us bid - but who were actually reporters working for the sunday times of london - for 3 million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.7 million euros , 2.3 million us dollars -rrb- so he could build a soccer academy in auckland .
confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- representative adamu requested 800,000 us dollars -lrb- 610,000 euros -rrb- - half paid in advance - in order to lay four artificial football pitches in his home country , nigeria .
sanction : temarii was suspended from football for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- , adamu barred for three years and fined 10,000 francs .
significance : high , in that it means two less people voting on thursday , altering the formula for garnering enough committee votes to win the right to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teixeira was once investigated by brazil 's senate isl 's secret payments description : issa hayatou , the cameroonian head of caf , brazil 's ricardo teixeira , and paraguay 's nicolas leoz , the head of south american confederation conmebol , have been accused of accepting bribes during the 1990s from the now-defunct sports marketing firm isl .
the bbc news magazine program " panorama " and swiss newspaper tages-anzeiger have said say they possess isl documents that show hayatou was paid 100,000 french francs -lrb- 15,200 euros -rrb- , leoz was paid $ 730,000 , and teixeira was paid $ 9.5 million via a shell company in liechtenstein .
sanction : none as yet .
fifa considers accusations related to its former media rights partner isl to be closed , but the international olympic committee , where hayatou is also a board member , may see things differently .
significance : in the short run , the claims will probably do little but harm england 's chances of landing the 2018 cup .
if these three voters had been considering voting for england , they 're now unlikely to do so since the corruption allegations were aired by the bbc .
in the long run , they could prove critical in cleaning up fifa , should any kind of outside investigation go forward .
the alleged instances of wrongdoing are up to two decades old , but the sums of money are massive - a ledger of similar payments made by isl - whose recipients remain unknown - total over 100 million us dollars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time warner is in trouble ticketgate description : trinidad and tobago 's jack warner , a fifa vice president and the head of concacaf - the confederation of caribbean , north and central american football - has been accused of again breaking fifa rules regulating the resale of word cup tickets .
" panorama , " along with the danish sporting newspaper tipsbladet , reported that warner bought more than 84,000 us dollars worth of tickets to the world cup in south africa so as to re-sell them to scalpers .
sanction : none as yet .
but since warner was caught doing much the same thing during the 2006 world cup in germany - and fined by fifa for it - he may be punished again .
significance : potentially great .
warner is believed to exert great influence over the way his concacaf colleagues chuck blazer -lrb- usa -rrb- and rafael salguero -lrb- guatemala -rrb- will vote , and thus has been courted assiduously by a number of 2018 bids .
the bbc program may have been enough of an embarrassment to move those three votes away from england and toward russia or spain / portugal .
the effect on the vote for the 2022 host is less significant as the three men are expected to favor the us , the only bid from within concacaf 's ranks .
longer-term , warner is thought to be a major power broker in the 2011 race for the fifa presidency , likely to pit incumbent sepp blatter against qatar 's mohamed bin hammam .
if warner were to be suspended , that race could be blown wide open .

critics say the kimberley process , which aims to certify the origin of rough diamonds , is failing .
by tolerating non-compliant states , ' blood diamond ' trade is endorsed , not stopped .
but should the process be abandoned ? for the last 10 years , the kimberley process certification scheme , or kp , has been considered one of the most successful international tripartite agreements between industry , government and civil society .
it aims to prevent conflict or " blood " diamonds from entering the legitimate diamond trade by a certification system that traces each gem back to its mine of origin .
over 75 percent of the world 's diamond producing , trading and manufacturing countries participate in the scheme .
so far , the kp claims , its approach has been successful .
for example , sierra leone , which was known for its bloody diamond wars of the 1990s , now exports millions of dollars worth of diamonds legally each year , which the kp boasts has helped develop the fragile state . but kp member zimbabwe has been trading uncertified diamonds in large quantities amid reports of human rights violations of miners at the hands of government forces .
now , the failure of the kp to pull zimbabwe into line has called into question the credibility and legitimacy of the process as the world 's diamond-trade watchdog .
' a vehicle with three flat tires ' ian smillie , a founder of the kimberley process , left his post last year due to frustrations with the process ' structure .
" i think the kp is failing , but i do n't think it has failed yet .
i refer to it as a vehicle with three flat tires , " smillie told deutsche welle .
" the problem is that it has literally allowed countries to get away with murder and not say anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marange mines were the site of a 2008 massacre the kimberley process has 49 members , representing 75 countries , with the european community and its member states counting as an individual participant .
kp members account for approximately 99.8 percent of the global production of rough diamonds .
kp members must meet minimum requirements in order to certify shipments of rough diamonds as " conflict-free . "
these include import and export controls , as well as a commitment to transparency .
the scheme is meant to prevent " blood diamonds , " which are used by rebel movements to finance conflict against legitimate governments , from entering the legitimate trade .
but according to smillie , the problem is that while the kimberley process is in the business of conflict prevention , it has failed to keep up with the times .
today , the trade in conflict diamonds is no longer run by rebel groups , but is institutionalized by legitimate governments , as is the case in zimbabwe .
" the problem is that the kp did n't keep up with the criminals , " he said .
" it did not allow for human rights violations . "
the question of zimbabwe dominated the kimberley process plenary meeting in jerusalem last month .
civil societies like human rights watch and fatal transactions want the kp to stand strong and enforce human rights provisions in agreement with member countries , with the possibility of suspending zimbabwe from the kp .
but not all members agreed .
smillie blamed the flawed voting system of the kp for allowing noncompliant countries like venezuela and zimbabwe to remain in the scheme .
currently , measures require an absolute consensus to pass .
countries with poor human-rights records - including china , russia and south africa - are reluctant to punish zimbabwe with suspension , he said .
the marange fields have attracted both south african and chinese investors .
" that 's how these countries have been protected , " he said .
" the process needs to be reformed so that the kp can start getting tough . "
the kp 's rogue state , zimbabwe since zimbabwe 's 2008 massacre , in which state security forces machine-gunned 200 miners to the ground from helicopters in order to claim the lucrative marange diamond fields in chiadzwa in the southeast , the kimberley process has attempted to monitor and restrict the sale of rough diamonds from the region .
a joint work plan was established , and minimum standards agreed between the kp and zimbabwean government .
however , at the plenary meeting in jerusalem , the kp and zimbabwean government reached an impasse .
marie mueller from fatal transactions , an ngo umbrella group based in bonn , germany , attended the meeting as a member of the kimberley process ' civil society coalition .
she said the negotiations were disappointing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe mines minister mpofu , far left , says his country is compliant " there is no result yet , as there was a deadlock at the end of the meeting , " she said .
" so behind backdoors , it seems negotiations are going on , but this is difficult to assess . "
while zimbabwe 's mining minister obert mpofu claimed that the country has " complied fully " with kp requirements , external investigations reveal human rights violations including beatings , rape and torture occur on the marange diamond fields .
members of the kp civil society coalition are also calling on zimbabwe to endorse local civil society monitoring mechanisms and to allow ngos to report on the kp conditions in marange .
human rights abuses continue human rights watch reports that the marange fields have become a military stronghold , with state security agents running their own illegal mining syndicates .
these cartels are responsible for the exploitation of illegal miners , many of whom are children , as well as harassment and violence towards local communities .
villagers are often displaced from their homes without adequate compensation .
the diamonds that are mined illegally in marange are then smuggled through mozambique , a non-kp member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the kp deliberates over zimbabwe , illegal diamonds will be traded .
according to shamiso mtisi , the local focal-point coordinator appointed by the kimberley process to monitor human rights abuses on the ground in zimbabwe , civil society is subject to threats and harassment by state security agents .
members of his staff are even afraid to continue their work , he said .
mtisi attended the jerusalem plenary meeting , but his position was not recognized by the zimbabwean government .
mtisi told deutsche welle that state agents threatened him before attending the conference .
" the government of zimbabwe needs to demilitarize the mining fields , " mtisi said .
" they also need to put in place a framework for small-scale miners and villagers , so that the local community can benefit . "
during the jerusalem meeting , the zimbabwean government made it clear that it would continue trading rough diamonds with or without the consent of the kp , with mining minister mpofu declaring : " zimbabwe will sell diamonds without any conditions . "
a $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 920 million euro -rrb- diamond deal between the zimbabwean government and indian sourcing consortium surat rough diamond sourcing india ltd will go ahead .
in exchange , the gujarat based traders will train 1,000 young zimbabweans in cutting and polishing diamonds .
evolution versus revolution ?
the world diamond council , which represents diamond manufacturing and trading companies and is a supporter of the kimberley process , says " evolution " is the key to the future of the kp .
it suggests implementing a stronger administrative body , as well as modifying the voting system .
instead of the current absolute consensus vote , the council advises a super-majority vote , such as a two-thirds or 75 percent majority rule , to limit the ability of minorities to derail agreements .
even detractors like smillie still have hope for the kimberley process .
" as long as it exists , there is still hope , " he said .
but he is quick to point out that while negotiations with zimbabwe continue , so too will the sale of conflict diamonds .

the kp 's rogue state , zimbabwe since zimbabwe 's 2008 massacre , in which state security forces machine-gunned 200 miners to the ground from helicopters in order to claim the lucrative marange diamond fields in chiadzwa in the southeast , the kimberley process has attempted to monitor and restrict the sale of rough diamonds from the region .
a joint work plan was established , and minimum standards agreed between the kp and zimbabwean government .
however , at the plenary meeting in jerusalem , the kp and zimbabwean government reached an impasse .
marie mueller from fatal transactions , an ngo umbrella group based in bonn , germany , attended the meeting as a member of the kimberley process ' civil society coalition .
she said the negotiations were disappointing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe mines minister mpofu , far left , says his country is compliant " there is no result yet , as there was a deadlock at the end of the meeting , " she said .
" so behind backdoors , it seems negotiations are going on , but this is difficult to assess . "
while zimbabwe 's mining minister obert mpofu claimed that the country has " complied fully " with kp requirements , external investigations reveal human rights violations including beatings , rape and torture occur on the marange diamond fields .
members of the kp civil society coalition are also calling on zimbabwe to endorse local civil society monitoring mechanisms and to allow ngos to report on the kp conditions in marange .
human rights abuses continue human rights watch reports that the marange fields have become a military stronghold , with state security agents running their own illegal mining syndicates .
these cartels are responsible for the exploitation of illegal miners , many of whom are children , as well as harassment and violence towards local communities .
villagers are often displaced from their homes without adequate compensation .
the diamonds that are mined illegally in marange are then smuggled through mozambique , a non-kp member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the kp deliberates over zimbabwe , illegal diamonds will be traded .
according to shamiso mtisi , the local focal-point coordinator appointed by the kimberley process to monitor human rights abuses on the ground in zimbabwe , civil society is subject to threats and harassment by state security agents .
members of his staff are even afraid to continue their work , he said .
mtisi attended the jerusalem plenary meeting , but his position was not recognized by the zimbabwean government .
mtisi told deutsche welle that state agents threatened him before attending the conference .
" the government of zimbabwe needs to demilitarize the mining fields , " mtisi said .
" they also need to put in place a framework for small-scale miners and villagers , so that the local community can benefit . "
during the jerusalem meeting , the zimbabwean government made it clear that it would continue trading rough diamonds with or without the consent of the kp , with mining minister mpofu declaring : " zimbabwe will sell diamonds without any conditions . "
a $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 920 million euro -rrb- diamond deal between the zimbabwean government and indian sourcing consortium surat rough diamond sourcing india ltd will go ahead .
in exchange , the gujarat based traders will train 1,000 young zimbabweans in cutting and polishing diamonds .
evolution versus revolution ?
the world diamond council , which represents diamond manufacturing and trading companies and is a supporter of the kimberley process , says " evolution " is the key to the future of the kp .
it suggests implementing a stronger administrative body , as well as modifying the voting system .
instead of the current absolute consensus vote , the council advises a super-majority vote , such as a two-thirds or 75 percent majority rule , to limit the ability of minorities to derail agreements .
even detractors like smillie still have hope for the kimberley process .
" as long as it exists , there is still hope , " he said .
but he is quick to point out that while negotiations with zimbabwe continue , so too will the sale of conflict diamonds .

the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

" complacency is not an option .
there are lessons to be learned from our performance in every bout of bad weather and it is important that we learn those now . "

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .
juergen klopp 's team has dropped a total of 4 points on the season thus far and have won five straight .
no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .
home advantage would usually count for something but with bvb on such a roll , it 's unlikely anything will help .
prediction : 3-0 dortmund .

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .

a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .

in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .
juergen klopp 's team has dropped a total of 4 points on the season thus far and have won five straight .
no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .
home advantage would usually count for something but with bvb on such a roll , it 's unlikely anything will help .
prediction : 3-0 dortmund .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 02.12.2010 scandal overshadows fifa executive committee as world cup votes loom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu and temarii wo n't get to vote on thursday as the vote to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 soccer world cups approaches , multiple accusations of bribery hang over the men doing the voting . world soccer 's governing body , fifa , is set to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 world cups on thursday .
it 's the first time the executive committee - who cast their votes to determine the outcome - has ever been asked to pick two world cup venues in one session .
however , the committee 's numbers have already been thinned out due to one corruption scandal , and others are still hanging over fifa 's head , threatening to spoil the party for the zurich-based organization .
here 's a rundown of the stories fifa would like to disappear on world cup selection day : cash for votes description : executive committee members reynald temarii and amos adamu were filmed offering pledges to vote for the united states ' 2022 bid in exchange for financial considerations .
temarii , a tahitian who represents the oceania football confederation -lrb- ofc -rrb- on the committee , asked men whom he believed were representatives of the us bid - but who were actually reporters working for the sunday times of london - for 3 million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.7 million euros , 2.3 million us dollars -rrb- so he could build a soccer academy in auckland .
confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- representative adamu requested 800,000 us dollars -lrb- 610,000 euros -rrb- - half paid in advance - in order to lay four artificial football pitches in his home country , nigeria .
sanction : temarii was suspended from football for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- , adamu barred for three years and fined 10,000 francs .
significance : high , in that it means two less people voting on thursday , altering the formula for garnering enough committee votes to win the right to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teixeira was once investigated by brazil 's senate isl 's secret payments description : issa hayatou , the cameroonian head of caf , brazil 's ricardo teixeira , and paraguay 's nicolas leoz , the head of south american confederation conmebol , have been accused of accepting bribes during the 1990s from the now-defunct sports marketing firm isl .
the bbc news magazine program " panorama " and swiss newspaper tages-anzeiger have said say they possess isl documents that show hayatou was paid 100,000 french francs -lrb- 15,200 euros -rrb- , leoz was paid $ 730,000 , and teixeira was paid $ 9.5 million via a shell company in liechtenstein .
sanction : none as yet .
fifa considers accusations related to its former media rights partner isl to be closed , but the international olympic committee , where hayatou is also a board member , may see things differently .
significance : in the short run , the claims will probably do little but harm england 's chances of landing the 2018 cup .
if these three voters had been considering voting for england , they 're now unlikely to do so since the corruption allegations were aired by the bbc .
in the long run , they could prove critical in cleaning up fifa , should any kind of outside investigation go forward .
the alleged instances of wrongdoing are up to two decades old , but the sums of money are massive - a ledger of similar payments made by isl - whose recipients remain unknown - total over 100 million us dollars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time warner is in trouble ticketgate description : trinidad and tobago 's jack warner , a fifa vice president and the head of concacaf - the confederation of caribbean , north and central american football - has been accused of again breaking fifa rules regulating the resale of word cup tickets .
" panorama , " along with the danish sporting newspaper tipsbladet , reported that warner bought more than 84,000 us dollars worth of tickets to the world cup in south africa so as to re-sell them to scalpers .
sanction : none as yet .
but since warner was caught doing much the same thing during the 2006 world cup in germany - and fined by fifa for it - he may be punished again .
significance : potentially great .
warner is believed to exert great influence over the way his concacaf colleagues chuck blazer -lrb- usa -rrb- and rafael salguero -lrb- guatemala -rrb- will vote , and thus has been courted assiduously by a number of 2018 bids .
the bbc program may have been enough of an embarrassment to move those three votes away from england and toward russia or spain / portugal .
the effect on the vote for the 2022 host is less significant as the three men are expected to favor the us , the only bid from within concacaf 's ranks .
longer-term , warner is thought to be a major power broker in the 2011 race for the fifa presidency , likely to pit incumbent sepp blatter against qatar 's mohamed bin hammam .
if warner were to be suspended , that race could be blown wide open .

meanwhile , qantas says it may sue rolls-royce for damages over a defect on one of its a380 superjumbos . with jet fuel prices expected to rise in coming years , airbus has announced it will offer its medium-sized a320 aircraft with next-generation engines capable of reducing fuel consumption by 15 percent .
airlines buying the new a320 variation can choose to have their aircraft equipped with engines manufactured by either cfm international or pratt & whitney .
that leaves rolls-royce out of the loop as it deals with the aftermath of an incident that saw one of its trent 900 engines catch fire during a qantas a380 superjumbo flight in november .
qantas says it will consider legal options against rolls-royce for the " financial and operational impacts " caused by the fire , after which the aircraft landed safely .
qantas ' six a380 aircraft were grounded november 4 .
two are now back in operational service .
according to klaus-heiner roehl , of the cologne institute for economic research , engines are a key component to the economic model of airlines .
the rolls-royce engine failure has far-reaching consequences for qantas , he said .
" there are certain routes they had planned to use this aircraft on , which they ca n't service for the time being , " roehl told deutsche welle .
" and the image damage is n't confined to rolls-royce .
qantas has to suffer from it as well , although it was n't their fault .
there are interconnected problems for the airlines as well . "
but carriers can generally choose between two engines when they buy planes .
while lufthansa chose rolls-royce engines for its a380 fleet , air france and emirates chose turbines made by engine alliance , a group including general electric and pratt & whitney .
the engine blowout could be very bad news for rolls-royce , as airlines are now more likely to order from engine alliance in future , roehl said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern aircraft and jet engines are incredibly complex efficient aircraft vital efficiency is something all airlines strive for , but roehl said technical problems can arise if manufacturers " are too ambitious in their plans . "
he sees airbus ' plan to begin offering its a320 model with new engines beginning in 2016 as sensible .
" it 's a very good aircraft which sells well , and of course one does n't want to break that by saying it 's outdated , " he said .
" one undertakes specific improvements . "
eddie pieniazek , head of consulting at ascend worldwide in london , said the increasing technical complexity of aircraft means engine malfunctions like the one on board the qantas a380 are n't uncommon .
" it 's a very high profile aircraft , and a high-profile airline … and -lrb- the incident -rrb- therefore caught the imagination of everyone , " he said .
efficient engines are key to a successful airline when one considers that the price of fuel cost was near 25 dollars per barrel during the 1990s and spiked to nearly 150 dollars a barrel in 2008 .
" airlines had gotten very used to having a stable figure for their fuel cost within their expense equation , " pieniazek told deutsche welle .
" once we started to see those rising fuel prices , the airlines suddenly realized how vulnerable they were to such a variable in their cost structure .
and i think a lot of them started to adapt a focus on having the most fuel efficient aircraft types , because that enables them to counter those kinds of shocks that can happen . "
according to pieniazek it 's simply impossible to make an outdated aircraft economically viable with today 's fuel prices .
hence the drive to incorporate ultramodern technology and drive down fuel consumption .
" you can see today in the market place that manufacturers are producing record numbers of aircraft , despite the fact that we 've gone through a downturn , because it 's the right aircraft that 's going forward , " he said .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first time the executive committee - who cast their votes to determine the outcome - has ever been asked to pick two world cup venues in one session .
however , the committee 's numbers have already been thinned out due to one corruption scandal , and others are still hanging over fifa 's head , threatening to spoil the party for the zurich-based organization .
here 's a rundown of the stories fifa would like to disappear on world cup selection day : cash for votes description : executive committee members reynald temarii and amos adamu were filmed offering pledges to vote for the united states ' 2022 bid in exchange for financial considerations .
temarii , a tahitian who represents the oceania football confederation -lrb- ofc -rrb- on the committee , asked men whom he believed were representatives of the us bid - but who were actually reporters working for the sunday times of london - for 3 million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.7 million euros , 2.3 million us dollars -rrb- so he could build a soccer academy in auckland .
confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- representative adamu requested 800,000 us dollars -lrb- 610,000 euros -rrb- - half paid in advance - in order to lay four artificial football pitches in his home country , nigeria .
sanction : temarii was suspended from football for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- , adamu barred for three years and fined 10,000 francs .
significance : high , in that it means two less people voting on thursday , altering the formula for garnering enough committee votes to win the right to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teixeira was once investigated by brazil 's senate isl 's secret payments description : issa hayatou , the cameroonian head of caf , brazil 's ricardo teixeira , and paraguay 's nicolas leoz , the head of south american confederation conmebol , have been accused of accepting bribes during the 1990s from the now-defunct sports marketing firm isl .
the bbc news magazine program " panorama " and swiss newspaper tages-anzeiger have said say they possess isl documents that show hayatou was paid 100,000 french francs -lrb- 15,200 euros -rrb- , leoz was paid $ 730,000 , and teixeira was paid $ 9.5 million via a shell company in liechtenstein .
sanction : none as yet .
fifa considers accusations related to its former media rights partner isl to be closed , but the international olympic committee , where hayatou is also a board member , may see things differently .
significance : in the short run , the claims will probably do little but harm england 's chances of landing the 2018 cup .
if these three voters had been considering voting for england , they 're now unlikely to do so since the corruption allegations were aired by the bbc .
in the long run , they could prove critical in cleaning up fifa , should any kind of outside investigation go forward .
the alleged instances of wrongdoing are up to two decades old , but the sums of money are massive - a ledger of similar payments made by isl - whose recipients remain unknown - total over 100 million us dollars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time warner is in trouble ticketgate description : trinidad and tobago 's jack warner , a fifa vice president and the head of concacaf - the confederation of caribbean , north and central american football - has been accused of again breaking fifa rules regulating the resale of word cup tickets .
" panorama , " along with the danish sporting newspaper tipsbladet , reported that warner bought more than 84,000 us dollars worth of tickets to the world cup in south africa so as to re-sell them to scalpers .
sanction : none as yet .
but since warner was caught doing much the same thing during the 2006 world cup in germany - and fined by fifa for it - he may be punished again .
significance : potentially great .
warner is believed to exert great influence over the way his concacaf colleagues chuck blazer -lrb- usa -rrb- and rafael salguero -lrb- guatemala -rrb- will vote , and thus has been courted assiduously by a number of 2018 bids .
the bbc program may have been enough of an embarrassment to move those three votes away from england and toward russia or spain / portugal .
the effect on the vote for the 2022 host is less significant as the three men are expected to favor the us , the only bid from within concacaf 's ranks .
longer-term , warner is thought to be a major power broker in the 2011 race for the fifa presidency , likely to pit incumbent sepp blatter against qatar 's mohamed bin hammam .
if warner were to be suspended , that race could be blown wide open .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

" unfortunately , in extreme weather conditions some disruption is inevitable but there is no excuse for poor communication with passengers and motorists , " said hammond .
" complacency is not an option .
there are lessons to be learned from our performance in every bout of bad weather and it is important that we learn those now . "
forecasters have predicted that europe 's first burst of winter could begin to loosen its icy grip by the weekend .

as us markets recover , german firms expect demand for their technical expertise , in particular , to grow . the united states ' economy has nowhere to go but up .
at least that 's what many german companies are betting on .
a survey released this week by the german american chamber of commerce in new york shows 91 percent of german companies expect the decline of the us economy is over .
what 's more , 22 percent foresee significant growth .
hans grandin , president of machine constructor komet usa , is amongst the optimists .
most of the 190 mid-sized companies surveyed make their money from industrial production – a sector that 's recovered more quickly than the consumer goods branch .
but grandin says he expects consumer goods to take off in the next two years as people start making the purchases they delayed during the recession .
a wave of new car sales is likely , which could " contribute to the need for new production methods , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans grandin 's company recently hired new staff new technologies like highly efficient motors are likely to be popular .
it could therefore be a time in which german companies are perfectly suited to meet rising demand thanks to their technological capabilities and skilled labor .
new hires in 2010 komet usa started in 1985 as a three-person outfit and grew to a size of 200 employees .
in 2008 and 2009 , the recession brought a slump in turnover to the industrial player , which operates in both america and europe .
management initially responded by laying off 22 percent of its workforce .
the company also cut employees ' hours – a labor practice which is common in germany , and is underpinned by government subsidies there .
not so in the united states , where komet usa shed an additional 5 percent of its jobs in 2009 .
business has picked up since then , but economic recovery does n't move in lockstep with a decrease in unemployment figures .
improved processes and automation mean komet usa is now able to lift its production volumes to 2008 levels with just 5 to 10 percent more workers .
for rolf biekert , head of the us subsidiary of trumpf , anchoring a business in the united states is a key to success .
trumpf makes high-tech machines tools and launched its american unit in 1969 .
the initially small operation grew to 700 employees , and is now north america 's largest producer of sheet metal processing machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf biekert says a good product and patience are keys to success in the us " one needs to have patience , one needs a good product , and one needs a good concept to approach the market with , " he told deutsche welle .
biekert says it 's vital for companies to present themselves as " long-term partners and not as short-term business ideas " and offer complete service for the machines they sell .
trumpf employs 150 people in customer service in the us and maintains a development department capable of putting together individual solutions for customers .
no worries neither grandin nor biekert are worried about the " buy american act . "
companies producing in the united states and creating jobs there are unlikely to face problems , they said .
however a clause giving us companies priority in being awarded some contracts was strengthened during the last economic stimulus .
bernhard welschke , who represents german industry in the united states , spoke out against the provision at tuesday 's press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' buy american act ' is a hurdle for german companies , but will expire " ultimately ' buy american ' is not good for the market , " welschke said .
he pointed out that the stimulus package will eventually expire , and that its provisions are therefore not a dominant concern among german firms .
german companies account for more than 650,000 jobs in the united states .
the value of their us investments was estimated at 218 billion dollars at the end of 2009 .
only british and japanese companies create more jobs , welschke said .
while the " buy american act " bothers german managers little , they are concerned about the ability to find qualified workers , changes in currency exchange rates and shortages of raw materials .
rare earth elements , for instance , are much needed in the renewable energy sector , where german companies are traditionally strong .
renewable energy as an economic engine the fact that sales figures for german businesses in the us have risen some 66 percent in 2010 can primarily be attributed to the manufacturing and renewable energy sectors .
but hans grandin says german firms in the us are n't just betting on stimulus money .
instead , they 're planning to profit from the country 's secure business environment with its clear laws and regulations .
in order to make the most of the opportunity , komet usa recently used its german ties to secure credit on better terms through its parent company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renewable energy is likely to be a driving economic force with economic prognoses improving on both sides of the atlantic , german companies operating in the united states are beginning to see things in a more positive light .
when the german american chamber of commerce did its first such survey in 2009 , 29 percent of companies said they believed the future of the us economy to be uncertain , and 8 percent said they expected it to shrink .
this year the number of pessimists has been halved to 4 percent .

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .
the study also revealed a more prevalent anti-jewish undercurrent in germany than in other western european countries .
a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are critical of women 's rights in islam while 50 percent of danes and two-thirds of the french and dutch respondents approved of the building of mosques , fewer than 30 percent of germans said they did .
in denmark , france and the netherlands , a clear majority of respondents viewed muslims positively .
in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .
juergen klopp 's team has dropped a total of 4 points on the season thus far and have won five straight .
no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .
home advantage would usually count for something but with bvb on such a roll , it 's unlikely anything will help .

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .
" we 've always had more good ideas than we 've had money and it will probably stay that way in the future .
besides , it would be sad if we lost our imagination . "

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

the world health organization has stepped up its research . global warming – and the consequent change in weather and rainfall patterns – is complicating matters for the world health organization in its fight against malaria in asia . the countries which are most at risk in the asia-pacific region are india , myanmar , bangladesh and indonesia . according to world health organization figures , two million people are at risk of contracting the illness .

the future of a legally binding un agreement to cut emissions is looking less certain . japan has said that it does not plan to sign up to the next commitment period of the kyoto protocol unless it includes binding emissions cuts for other big polluters like the united states and china .
" it does not make sense to set the second commitment period under the kyoto protocol as the current kyoto protocol is imposing obligations on only a small part of developed countries , " japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa told reporters in cancun .
he said a broader deal was needed as kyoto only applied to rich countries .
the united states abandoned the treaty in 2001 , while china is spared legally binding commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions because it is classified as a developing country .
under kyoto , rich nations must cut their emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
however , these parties only account for less than a third of the world 's emissions .
the first commitment period of the protocol expires in 2012 , and delegates to the climate talks in cancun are under pressure to determine what happens thereafter .
threat of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minamikawa says extending kyoto ' does not make sense ' developing countries said that climate talks in mexico would fail unless tokyo backed down on its plan to abandon the un climate pact .
" there will be no successful outcome for cancun , " if japan sticks to its refusal to extend cuts under kyoto , said abdulla alsaidi , the chair of the group of 77 and china , the main body of developing nations at the two-week talks in mexico .
the un talks are essentially taking place on two tracks , with linkages .
one track gathers all 194 parties under the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , including the united states , on worldwide action beyond 2012 .
the other track gathers the 193 parties to the kyoto protocol - all countries except the united states .
developing countries have said they will commit to a deal in the first track provided there is a deal for renewing kyoto , the japanese city where the protocol was signed in 1997 .
as a result , if japan and other rich countries bale out of kyoto , that could bring the rest of the talks to a standstill .
un climate chief christiana figueres said japan had made similar statements in the past and warned all sides that a clear decision on kyoto 's fate was not expected to be taken in cancun .
" given the diversity of positions on the kyoto protocol , it is not going to be possible for cancun to take a radical decision one way or another on the kyoto protocol , " she said .
that means even less time to agree on what happens to kyoto before 2012 .
not all bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are low expectation about what delegates can achieve at cancun in addition to kyoto , protecting the planet 's forests is high on the agenda at cancun as forest destruction is responsible for up to 17 percent of mankind 's greenhouse gas emissions .
google unveiled technology on thursday which it said would help build trust between rich and poor countries on projects designed to protect the world 's tropical forests .
measuring the success of forest-protection plans in places like the amazon , indonesia and the congo basin has always been difficult because tree disease , corruption and illegal logging threaten vast remote areas that scientists ca n't monitor by land .
global deals among nations to protect forests have been slowed by the lack of transparency .
negotiators at the climate talks believe progress can be made on a global plan called reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation -lrb- redd -rrb- in which rich countries would fund rewards for developing and poor nations like brazil , indonesia and several in africa , such as rwanda , that save and restore forests .
google said it hoped its tool would help speed cooperation in redd , which could lead to further global agreements on climate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 02.12.2010 german companies bullish about future in united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies in the us say the worst is over a new survey of german companies operating in the united states shows that bad feelings are giving way to optimism .
as us markets recover , german firms expect demand for their technical expertise , in particular , to grow . the united states ' economy has nowhere to go but up .
at least that 's what many german companies are betting on .
a survey released this week by the german american chamber of commerce in new york shows 91 percent of german companies expect the decline of the us economy is over .
what 's more , 22 percent foresee significant growth .
hans grandin , president of machine constructor komet usa , is amongst the optimists .
most of the 190 mid-sized companies surveyed make their money from industrial production – a sector that 's recovered more quickly than the consumer goods branch .
but grandin says he expects consumer goods to take off in the next two years as people start making the purchases they delayed during the recession .
a wave of new car sales is likely , which could " contribute to the need for new production methods , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans grandin 's company recently hired new staff new technologies like highly efficient motors are likely to be popular .
it could therefore be a time in which german companies are perfectly suited to meet rising demand thanks to their technological capabilities and skilled labor .
new hires in 2010 komet usa started in 1985 as a three-person outfit and grew to a size of 200 employees .
in 2008 and 2009 , the recession brought a slump in turnover to the industrial player , which operates in both america and europe .
management initially responded by laying off 22 percent of its workforce .
the company also cut employees ' hours – a labor practice which is common in germany , and is underpinned by government subsidies there .
not so in the united states , where komet usa shed an additional 5 percent of its jobs in 2009 .
business has picked up since then , but economic recovery does n't move in lockstep with a decrease in unemployment figures .
improved processes and automation mean komet usa is now able to lift its production volumes to 2008 levels with just 5 to 10 percent more workers .
for rolf biekert , head of the us subsidiary of trumpf , anchoring a business in the united states is a key to success .
trumpf makes high-tech machines tools and launched its american unit in 1969 .
the initially small operation grew to 700 employees , and is now north america 's largest producer of sheet metal processing machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf biekert says a good product and patience are keys to success in the us " one needs to have patience , one needs a good product , and one needs a good concept to approach the market with , " he told deutsche welle .
biekert says it 's vital for companies to present themselves as " long-term partners and not as short-term business ideas " and offer complete service for the machines they sell .
trumpf employs 150 people in customer service in the us and maintains a development department capable of putting together individual solutions for customers .
no worries neither grandin nor biekert are worried about the " buy american act . "
companies producing in the united states and creating jobs there are unlikely to face problems , they said .
however a clause giving us companies priority in being awarded some contracts was strengthened during the last economic stimulus .
bernhard welschke , who represents german industry in the united states , spoke out against the provision at tuesday 's press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' buy american act ' is a hurdle for german companies , but will expire " ultimately ' buy american ' is not good for the market , " welschke said .
he pointed out that the stimulus package will eventually expire , and that its provisions are therefore not a dominant concern among german firms .
german companies account for more than 650,000 jobs in the united states .
the value of their us investments was estimated at 218 billion dollars at the end of 2009 .
only british and japanese companies create more jobs , welschke said .
while the " buy american act " bothers german managers little , they are concerned about the ability to find qualified workers , changes in currency exchange rates and shortages of raw materials .
rare earth elements , for instance , are much needed in the renewable energy sector , where german companies are traditionally strong .
renewable energy as an economic engine the fact that sales figures for german businesses in the us have risen some 66 percent in 2010 can primarily be attributed to the manufacturing and renewable energy sectors .
but hans grandin says german firms in the us are n't just betting on stimulus money .
instead , they 're planning to profit from the country 's secure business environment with its clear laws and regulations .
in order to make the most of the opportunity , komet usa recently used its german ties to secure credit on better terms through its parent company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renewable energy is likely to be a driving economic force with economic prognoses improving on both sides of the atlantic , german companies operating in the united states are beginning to see things in a more positive light .
when the german american chamber of commerce did its first such survey in 2009 , 29 percent of companies said they believed the future of the us economy to be uncertain , and 8 percent said they expected it to shrink .
this year the number of pessimists has been halved to 4 percent .

critics say the kimberley process , which aims to certify the origin of rough diamonds , is failing .
by tolerating non-compliant states , ' blood diamond ' trade is endorsed , not stopped .
but should the process be abandoned ? for the last 10 years , the kimberley process certification scheme , or kp , has been considered one of the most successful international tripartite agreements between industry , government and civil society .
it aims to prevent conflict or " blood " diamonds from entering the legitimate diamond trade by a certification system that traces each gem back to its mine of origin .
over 75 percent of the world 's diamond producing , trading and manufacturing countries participate in the scheme .
so far , the kp claims , its approach has been successful .
for example , sierra leone , which was known for its bloody diamond wars of the 1990s , now exports millions of dollars worth of diamonds legally each year , which the kp boasts has helped develop the fragile state . but kp member zimbabwe has been trading uncertified diamonds in large quantities amid reports of human rights violations of miners at the hands of government forces .
now , the failure of the kp to pull zimbabwe into line has called into question the credibility and legitimacy of the process as the world 's diamond-trade watchdog .
' a vehicle with three flat tires ' ian smillie , a founder of the kimberley process , left his post last year due to frustrations with the process ' structure .
" i think the kp is failing , but i do n't think it has failed yet .
i refer to it as a vehicle with three flat tires , " smillie told deutsche welle .
" the problem is that it has literally allowed countries to get away with murder and not say anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marange mines were the site of a 2008 massacre the kimberley process has 49 members , representing 75 countries , with the european community and its member states counting as an individual participant .
kp members account for approximately 99.8 percent of the global production of rough diamonds .
kp members must meet minimum requirements in order to certify shipments of rough diamonds as " conflict-free . "
these include import and export controls , as well as a commitment to transparency .
the scheme is meant to prevent " blood diamonds , " which are used by rebel movements to finance conflict against legitimate governments , from entering the legitimate trade .
but according to smillie , the problem is that while the kimberley process is in the business of conflict prevention , it has failed to keep up with the times .
today , the trade in conflict diamonds is no longer run by rebel groups , but is institutionalized by legitimate governments , as is the case in zimbabwe .
" the problem is that the kp did n't keep up with the criminals , " he said .
" it did not allow for human rights violations . "
the question of zimbabwe dominated the kimberley process plenary meeting in jerusalem last month .
civil societies like human rights watch and fatal transactions want the kp to stand strong and enforce human rights provisions in agreement with member countries , with the possibility of suspending zimbabwe from the kp .
but not all members agreed .
smillie blamed the flawed voting system of the kp for allowing noncompliant countries like venezuela and zimbabwe to remain in the scheme .
currently , measures require an absolute consensus to pass .
countries with poor human-rights records - including china , russia and south africa - are reluctant to punish zimbabwe with suspension , he said .
the marange fields have attracted both south african and chinese investors .
" that 's how these countries have been protected , " he said .
" the process needs to be reformed so that the kp can start getting tough . "
the kp 's rogue state , zimbabwe since zimbabwe 's 2008 massacre , in which state security forces machine-gunned 200 miners to the ground from helicopters in order to claim the lucrative marange diamond fields in chiadzwa in the southeast , the kimberley process has attempted to monitor and restrict the sale of rough diamonds from the region .
a joint work plan was established , and minimum standards agreed between the kp and zimbabwean government .
however , at the plenary meeting in jerusalem , the kp and zimbabwean government reached an impasse .
marie mueller from fatal transactions , an ngo umbrella group based in bonn , germany , attended the meeting as a member of the kimberley process ' civil society coalition .
she said the negotiations were disappointing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe mines minister mpofu , far left , says his country is compliant " there is no result yet , as there was a deadlock at the end of the meeting , " she said .
" so behind backdoors , it seems negotiations are going on , but this is difficult to assess . "
while zimbabwe 's mining minister obert mpofu claimed that the country has " complied fully " with kp requirements , external investigations reveal human rights violations including beatings , rape and torture occur on the marange diamond fields .
members of the kp civil society coalition are also calling on zimbabwe to endorse local civil society monitoring mechanisms and to allow ngos to report on the kp conditions in marange .
human rights abuses continue human rights watch reports that the marange fields have become a military stronghold , with state security agents running their own illegal mining syndicates .
these cartels are responsible for the exploitation of illegal miners , many of whom are children , as well as harassment and violence towards local communities .
villagers are often displaced from their homes without adequate compensation .
the diamonds that are mined illegally in marange are then smuggled through mozambique , a non-kp member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the kp deliberates over zimbabwe , illegal diamonds will be traded .
according to shamiso mtisi , the local focal-point coordinator appointed by the kimberley process to monitor human rights abuses on the ground in zimbabwe , civil society is subject to threats and harassment by state security agents .
members of his staff are even afraid to continue their work , he said .
mtisi attended the jerusalem plenary meeting , but his position was not recognized by the zimbabwean government .
mtisi told deutsche welle that state agents threatened him before attending the conference .
" the government of zimbabwe needs to demilitarize the mining fields , " mtisi said .
" they also need to put in place a framework for small-scale miners and villagers , so that the local community can benefit . "
during the jerusalem meeting , the zimbabwean government made it clear that it would continue trading rough diamonds with or without the consent of the kp , with mining minister mpofu declaring : " zimbabwe will sell diamonds without any conditions . "
a $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 920 million euro -rrb- diamond deal between the zimbabwean government and indian sourcing consortium surat rough diamond sourcing india ltd will go ahead .
in exchange , the gujarat based traders will train 1,000 young zimbabweans in cutting and polishing diamonds .
evolution versus revolution ?
the world diamond council , which represents diamond manufacturing and trading companies and is a supporter of the kimberley process , says " evolution " is the key to the future of the kp .
it suggests implementing a stronger administrative body , as well as modifying the voting system .
instead of the current absolute consensus vote , the council advises a super-majority vote , such as a two-thirds or 75 percent majority rule , to limit the ability of minorities to derail agreements .
even detractors like smillie still have hope for the kimberley process .
" as long as it exists , there is still hope , " he said .
but he is quick to point out that while negotiations with zimbabwe continue , so too will the sale of conflict diamonds .

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

deaths were reported in germany , poland , lithuania and the czech republic . an early cold snap , along with heavy snowfall and ice , has been wreaking havoc across northern europe , causing deaths and bringing travel in many countries to a standstill .
three people were killed in germany overnight wednesday in road accidents caused by the weather .

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .

no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

the future of a legally binding un agreement to cut emissions is looking less certain . japan has said that it does not plan to sign up to the next commitment period of the kyoto protocol unless it includes binding emissions cuts for other big polluters like the united states and china .
" it does not make sense to set the second commitment period under the kyoto protocol as the current kyoto protocol is imposing obligations on only a small part of developed countries , " japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa told reporters in cancun .
he said a broader deal was needed as kyoto only applied to rich countries .
the united states abandoned the treaty in 2001 , while china is spared legally binding commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions because it is classified as a developing country .
under kyoto , rich nations must cut their emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
however , these parties only account for less than a third of the world 's emissions .
the first commitment period of the protocol expires in 2012 , and delegates to the climate talks in cancun are under pressure to determine what happens thereafter .
threat of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minamikawa says extending kyoto ' does not make sense ' developing countries said that climate talks in mexico would fail unless tokyo backed down on its plan to abandon the un climate pact .
" there will be no successful outcome for cancun , " if japan sticks to its refusal to extend cuts under kyoto , said abdulla alsaidi , the chair of the group of 77 and china , the main body of developing nations at the two-week talks in mexico .
the un talks are essentially taking place on two tracks , with linkages .
one track gathers all 194 parties under the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , including the united states , on worldwide action beyond 2012 .
the other track gathers the 193 parties to the kyoto protocol - all countries except the united states .
developing countries have said they will commit to a deal in the first track provided there is a deal for renewing kyoto , the japanese city where the protocol was signed in 1997 .
as a result , if japan and other rich countries bale out of kyoto , that could bring the rest of the talks to a standstill .
un climate chief christiana figueres said japan had made similar statements in the past and warned all sides that a clear decision on kyoto 's fate was not expected to be taken in cancun .
" given the diversity of positions on the kyoto protocol , it is not going to be possible for cancun to take a radical decision one way or another on the kyoto protocol , " she said .
that means even less time to agree on what happens to kyoto before 2012 .
not all bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are low expectation about what delegates can achieve at cancun in addition to kyoto , protecting the planet 's forests is high on the agenda at cancun as forest destruction is responsible for up to 17 percent of mankind 's greenhouse gas emissions .
google unveiled technology on thursday which it said would help build trust between rich and poor countries on projects designed to protect the world 's tropical forests .
measuring the success of forest-protection plans in places like the amazon , indonesia and the congo basin has always been difficult because tree disease , corruption and illegal logging threaten vast remote areas that scientists ca n't monitor by land .
global deals among nations to protect forests have been slowed by the lack of transparency .
negotiators at the climate talks believe progress can be made on a global plan called reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation -lrb- redd -rrb- in which rich countries would fund rewards for developing and poor nations like brazil , indonesia and several in africa , such as rwanda , that save and restore forests .
google said it hoped its tool would help speed cooperation in redd , which could lead to further global agreements on climate .

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 02.12.2010 scandal overshadows fifa executive committee as world cup votes loom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu and temarii wo n't get to vote on thursday as the vote to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 soccer world cups approaches , multiple accusations of bribery hang over the men doing the voting . world soccer 's governing body , fifa , is set to decide which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 world cups on thursday .
it 's the first time the executive committee - who cast their votes to determine the outcome - has ever been asked to pick two world cup venues in one session .
however , the committee 's numbers have already been thinned out due to one corruption scandal , and others are still hanging over fifa 's head , threatening to spoil the party for the zurich-based organization .
here 's a rundown of the stories fifa would like to disappear on world cup selection day : cash for votes description : executive committee members reynald temarii and amos adamu were filmed offering pledges to vote for the united states ' 2022 bid in exchange for financial considerations .
temarii , a tahitian who represents the oceania football confederation -lrb- ofc -rrb- on the committee , asked men whom he believed were representatives of the us bid - but who were actually reporters working for the sunday times of london - for 3 million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.7 million euros , 2.3 million us dollars -rrb- so he could build a soccer academy in auckland .
confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- representative adamu requested 800,000 us dollars -lrb- 610,000 euros -rrb- - half paid in advance - in order to lay four artificial football pitches in his home country , nigeria .
sanction : temarii was suspended from football for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- , adamu barred for three years and fined 10,000 francs .
significance : high , in that it means two less people voting on thursday , altering the formula for garnering enough committee votes to win the right to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teixeira was once investigated by brazil 's senate isl 's secret payments description : issa hayatou , the cameroonian head of caf , brazil 's ricardo teixeira , and paraguay 's nicolas leoz , the head of south american confederation conmebol , have been accused of accepting bribes during the 1990s from the now-defunct sports marketing firm isl .
the bbc news magazine program " panorama " and swiss newspaper tages-anzeiger have said say they possess isl documents that show hayatou was paid 100,000 french francs -lrb- 15,200 euros -rrb- , leoz was paid $ 730,000 , and teixeira was paid $ 9.5 million via a shell company in liechtenstein .
sanction : none as yet .
fifa considers accusations related to its former media rights partner isl to be closed , but the international olympic committee , where hayatou is also a board member , may see things differently .
significance : in the short run , the claims will probably do little but harm england 's chances of landing the 2018 cup .
if these three voters had been considering voting for england , they 're now unlikely to do so since the corruption allegations were aired by the bbc .
in the long run , they could prove critical in cleaning up fifa , should any kind of outside investigation go forward .
the alleged instances of wrongdoing are up to two decades old , but the sums of money are massive - a ledger of similar payments made by isl - whose recipients remain unknown - total over 100 million us dollars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time warner is in trouble ticketgate description : trinidad and tobago 's jack warner , a fifa vice president and the head of concacaf - the confederation of caribbean , north and central american football - has been accused of again breaking fifa rules regulating the resale of word cup tickets .
" panorama , " along with the danish sporting newspaper tipsbladet , reported that warner bought more than 84,000 us dollars worth of tickets to the world cup in south africa so as to re-sell them to scalpers .
sanction : none as yet .
but since warner was caught doing much the same thing during the 2006 world cup in germany - and fined by fifa for it - he may be punished again .
significance : potentially great .
warner is believed to exert great influence over the way his concacaf colleagues chuck blazer -lrb- usa -rrb- and rafael salguero -lrb- guatemala -rrb- will vote , and thus has been courted assiduously by a number of 2018 bids .
the bbc program may have been enough of an embarrassment to move those three votes away from england and toward russia or spain / portugal .
the effect on the vote for the 2022 host is less significant as the three men are expected to favor the us , the only bid from within concacaf 's ranks .
longer-term , warner is thought to be a major power broker in the 2011 race for the fifa presidency , likely to pit incumbent sepp blatter against qatar 's mohamed bin hammam .
if warner were to be suspended , that race could be blown wide open .

the future of a legally binding un agreement to cut emissions is looking less certain . japan has said that it does not plan to sign up to the next commitment period of the kyoto protocol unless it includes binding emissions cuts for other big polluters like the united states and china .
" it does not make sense to set the second commitment period under the kyoto protocol as the current kyoto protocol is imposing obligations on only a small part of developed countries , " japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa told reporters in cancun .
he said a broader deal was needed as kyoto only applied to rich countries .
the united states abandoned the treaty in 2001 , while china is spared legally binding commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions because it is classified as a developing country .
under kyoto , rich nations must cut their emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
however , these parties only account for less than a third of the world 's emissions .
the first commitment period of the protocol expires in 2012 , and delegates to the climate talks in cancun are under pressure to determine what happens thereafter .
threat of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minamikawa says extending kyoto ' does not make sense ' developing countries said that climate talks in mexico would fail unless tokyo backed down on its plan to abandon the un climate pact .
" there will be no successful outcome for cancun , " if japan sticks to its refusal to extend cuts under kyoto , said abdulla alsaidi , the chair of the group of 77 and china , the main body of developing nations at the two-week talks in mexico .
the un talks are essentially taking place on two tracks , with linkages .
one track gathers all 194 parties under the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , including the united states , on worldwide action beyond 2012 .
the other track gathers the 193 parties to the kyoto protocol - all countries except the united states .
developing countries have said they will commit to a deal in the first track provided there is a deal for renewing kyoto , the japanese city where the protocol was signed in 1997 .
as a result , if japan and other rich countries bale out of kyoto , that could bring the rest of the talks to a standstill .
un climate chief christiana figueres said japan had made similar statements in the past and warned all sides that a clear decision on kyoto 's fate was not expected to be taken in cancun .
" given the diversity of positions on the kyoto protocol , it is not going to be possible for cancun to take a radical decision one way or another on the kyoto protocol , " she said .
that means even less time to agree on what happens to kyoto before 2012 .
not all bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are low expectation about what delegates can achieve at cancun in addition to kyoto , protecting the planet 's forests is high on the agenda at cancun as forest destruction is responsible for up to 17 percent of mankind 's greenhouse gas emissions .
google unveiled technology on thursday which it said would help build trust between rich and poor countries on projects designed to protect the world 's tropical forests .
measuring the success of forest-protection plans in places like the amazon , indonesia and the congo basin has always been difficult because tree disease , corruption and illegal logging threaten vast remote areas that scientists ca n't monitor by land .
global deals among nations to protect forests have been slowed by the lack of transparency .
negotiators at the climate talks believe progress can be made on a global plan called reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation -lrb- redd -rrb- in which rich countries would fund rewards for developing and poor nations like brazil , indonesia and several in africa , such as rwanda , that save and restore forests .
google said it hoped its tool would help speed cooperation in redd , which could lead to further global agreements on climate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 02.12.2010 german future prize goes to grappler developer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research leader peter post with the grappler in a dw interview , peter post , a german innovator explains the bionic grappler , a high-tech helper modeled after an elephant 's trunk . on wednesday evening , the festo company and its bionic handling assistant were awarded germany 's annual future prize at a ceremony in berlin .
the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 02.12.2010 germany to focus on european space missions , abandon national moon plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is giving up its national sights on the moon despite a tight budget , germany aims to increase investment in space science and technology to fuel innovation and growth through the auspices of the european space agency rather than its own national space program . the german government said this week it would step up public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .
" we 've always had more good ideas than we 've had money and it will probably stay that way in the future .
besides , it would be sad if we lost our imagination . "

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .
the study also revealed a more prevalent anti-jewish undercurrent in germany than in other western european countries .
a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .

in denmark , france and the netherlands , a clear majority of respondents viewed muslims positively .
in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 02.12.2010 airbus unveils new a320 engines as rolls-royce enters damage control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient engines are vital to airlines ' business models airbus is offering its medium-sized a320 aircraft with a new range of engines designed to reduce fuel consumption .
meanwhile , qantas says it may sue rolls-royce for damages over a defect on one of its a380 superjumbos . with jet fuel prices expected to rise in coming years , airbus has announced it will offer its medium-sized a320 aircraft with next-generation engines capable of reducing fuel consumption by 15 percent .
airlines buying the new a320 variation can choose to have their aircraft equipped with engines manufactured by either cfm international or pratt & whitney .
that leaves rolls-royce out of the loop as it deals with the aftermath of an incident that saw one of its trent 900 engines catch fire during a qantas a380 superjumbo flight in november .
qantas says it will consider legal options against rolls-royce for the " financial and operational impacts " caused by the fire , after which the aircraft landed safely .
qantas ' six a380 aircraft were grounded november 4 .
two are now back in operational service .
according to klaus-heiner roehl , of the cologne institute for economic research , engines are a key component to the economic model of airlines .
the rolls-royce engine failure has far-reaching consequences for qantas , he said .
" there are certain routes they had planned to use this aircraft on , which they ca n't service for the time being , " roehl told deutsche welle .
" and the image damage is n't confined to rolls-royce .
qantas has to suffer from it as well , although it was n't their fault .
there are interconnected problems for the airlines as well . "
but carriers can generally choose between two engines when they buy planes .
while lufthansa chose rolls-royce engines for its a380 fleet , air france and emirates chose turbines made by engine alliance , a group including general electric and pratt & whitney .
the engine blowout could be very bad news for rolls-royce , as airlines are now more likely to order from engine alliance in future , roehl said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern aircraft and jet engines are incredibly complex efficient aircraft vital efficiency is something all airlines strive for , but roehl said technical problems can arise if manufacturers " are too ambitious in their plans . "
he sees airbus ' plan to begin offering its a320 model with new engines beginning in 2016 as sensible .
" it 's a very good aircraft which sells well , and of course one does n't want to break that by saying it 's outdated , " he said .
" one undertakes specific improvements . "
eddie pieniazek , head of consulting at ascend worldwide in london , said the increasing technical complexity of aircraft means engine malfunctions like the one on board the qantas a380 are n't uncommon .
" it 's a very high profile aircraft , and a high-profile airline … and -lrb- the incident -rrb- therefore caught the imagination of everyone , " he said .
efficient engines are key to a successful airline when one considers that the price of fuel cost was near 25 dollars per barrel during the 1990s and spiked to nearly 150 dollars a barrel in 2008 .
" airlines had gotten very used to having a stable figure for their fuel cost within their expense equation , " pieniazek told deutsche welle .
" once we started to see those rising fuel prices , the airlines suddenly realized how vulnerable they were to such a variable in their cost structure .
and i think a lot of them started to adapt a focus on having the most fuel efficient aircraft types , because that enables them to counter those kinds of shocks that can happen . "
according to pieniazek it 's simply impossible to make an outdated aircraft economically viable with today 's fuel prices .
hence the drive to incorporate ultramodern technology and drive down fuel consumption .
" you can see today in the market place that manufacturers are producing record numbers of aircraft , despite the fact that we 've gone through a downturn , because it 's the right aircraft that 's going forward , " he said .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks : us pressured germany after cia abduction mistake opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy crime -pipe- 02.12.2010 us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange could face serious charges in the us the pressure on wikileaks founder julian assange is mounting .
not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 02.12.2010 german companies bullish about future in united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies in the us say the worst is over a new survey of german companies operating in the united states shows that bad feelings are giving way to optimism .
as us markets recover , german firms expect demand for their technical expertise , in particular , to grow . the united states ' economy has nowhere to go but up .
at least that 's what many german companies are betting on .
a survey released this week by the german american chamber of commerce in new york shows 91 percent of german companies expect the decline of the us economy is over .
what 's more , 22 percent foresee significant growth .
hans grandin , president of machine constructor komet usa , is amongst the optimists .
most of the 190 mid-sized companies surveyed make their money from industrial production – a sector that 's recovered more quickly than the consumer goods branch .
but grandin says he expects consumer goods to take off in the next two years as people start making the purchases they delayed during the recession .
a wave of new car sales is likely , which could " contribute to the need for new production methods , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans grandin 's company recently hired new staff new technologies like highly efficient motors are likely to be popular .
it could therefore be a time in which german companies are perfectly suited to meet rising demand thanks to their technological capabilities and skilled labor .
new hires in 2010 komet usa started in 1985 as a three-person outfit and grew to a size of 200 employees .
in 2008 and 2009 , the recession brought a slump in turnover to the industrial player , which operates in both america and europe .
management initially responded by laying off 22 percent of its workforce .
the company also cut employees ' hours – a labor practice which is common in germany , and is underpinned by government subsidies there .
not so in the united states , where komet usa shed an additional 5 percent of its jobs in 2009 .
business has picked up since then , but economic recovery does n't move in lockstep with a decrease in unemployment figures .
improved processes and automation mean komet usa is now able to lift its production volumes to 2008 levels with just 5 to 10 percent more workers .
for rolf biekert , head of the us subsidiary of trumpf , anchoring a business in the united states is a key to success .
trumpf makes high-tech machines tools and launched its american unit in 1969 .
the initially small operation grew to 700 employees , and is now north america 's largest producer of sheet metal processing machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf biekert says a good product and patience are keys to success in the us " one needs to have patience , one needs a good product , and one needs a good concept to approach the market with , " he told deutsche welle .
biekert says it 's vital for companies to present themselves as " long-term partners and not as short-term business ideas " and offer complete service for the machines they sell .
trumpf employs 150 people in customer service in the us and maintains a development department capable of putting together individual solutions for customers .
no worries neither grandin nor biekert are worried about the " buy american act . "
companies producing in the united states and creating jobs there are unlikely to face problems , they said .
however a clause giving us companies priority in being awarded some contracts was strengthened during the last economic stimulus .
bernhard welschke , who represents german industry in the united states , spoke out against the provision at tuesday 's press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' buy american act ' is a hurdle for german companies , but will expire " ultimately ' buy american ' is not good for the market , " welschke said .
he pointed out that the stimulus package will eventually expire , and that its provisions are therefore not a dominant concern among german firms .
german companies account for more than 650,000 jobs in the united states .
the value of their us investments was estimated at 218 billion dollars at the end of 2009 .
only british and japanese companies create more jobs , welschke said .
while the " buy american act " bothers german managers little , they are concerned about the ability to find qualified workers , changes in currency exchange rates and shortages of raw materials .
rare earth elements , for instance , are much needed in the renewable energy sector , where german companies are traditionally strong .
renewable energy as an economic engine the fact that sales figures for german businesses in the us have risen some 66 percent in 2010 can primarily be attributed to the manufacturing and renewable energy sectors .
but hans grandin says german firms in the us are n't just betting on stimulus money .
instead , they 're planning to profit from the country 's secure business environment with its clear laws and regulations .
in order to make the most of the opportunity , komet usa recently used its german ties to secure credit on better terms through its parent company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renewable energy is likely to be a driving economic force with economic prognoses improving on both sides of the atlantic , german companies operating in the united states are beginning to see things in a more positive light .
when the german american chamber of commerce did its first such survey in 2009 , 29 percent of companies said they believed the future of the us economy to be uncertain , and 8 percent said they expected it to shrink .
this year the number of pessimists has been halved to 4 percent .

the future of a legally binding un agreement to cut emissions is looking less certain . japan has said that it does not plan to sign up to the next commitment period of the kyoto protocol unless it includes binding emissions cuts for other big polluters like the united states and china .
" it does not make sense to set the second commitment period under the kyoto protocol as the current kyoto protocol is imposing obligations on only a small part of developed countries , " japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa told reporters in cancun .
he said a broader deal was needed as kyoto only applied to rich countries .
the united states abandoned the treaty in 2001 , while china is spared legally binding commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions because it is classified as a developing country .
under kyoto , rich nations must cut their emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
however , these parties only account for less than a third of the world 's emissions .
the first commitment period of the protocol expires in 2012 , and delegates to the climate talks in cancun are under pressure to determine what happens thereafter .
threat of failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minamikawa says extending kyoto ' does not make sense ' developing countries said that climate talks in mexico would fail unless tokyo backed down on its plan to abandon the un climate pact .
" there will be no successful outcome for cancun , " if japan sticks to its refusal to extend cuts under kyoto , said abdulla alsaidi , the chair of the group of 77 and china , the main body of developing nations at the two-week talks in mexico .
the un talks are essentially taking place on two tracks , with linkages .
one track gathers all 194 parties under the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , including the united states , on worldwide action beyond 2012 .
the other track gathers the 193 parties to the kyoto protocol - all countries except the united states .
developing countries have said they will commit to a deal in the first track provided there is a deal for renewing kyoto , the japanese city where the protocol was signed in 1997 .
as a result , if japan and other rich countries bale out of kyoto , that could bring the rest of the talks to a standstill .
un climate chief christiana figueres said japan had made similar statements in the past and warned all sides that a clear decision on kyoto 's fate was not expected to be taken in cancun .
" given the diversity of positions on the kyoto protocol , it is not going to be possible for cancun to take a radical decision one way or another on the kyoto protocol , " she said .
that means even less time to agree on what happens to kyoto before 2012 .
not all bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are low expectation about what delegates can achieve at cancun in addition to kyoto , protecting the planet 's forests is high on the agenda at cancun as forest destruction is responsible for up to 17 percent of mankind 's greenhouse gas emissions .
google unveiled technology on thursday which it said would help build trust between rich and poor countries on projects designed to protect the world 's tropical forests .
measuring the success of forest-protection plans in places like the amazon , indonesia and the congo basin has always been difficult because tree disease , corruption and illegal logging threaten vast remote areas that scientists ca n't monitor by land .
global deals among nations to protect forests have been slowed by the lack of transparency .
negotiators at the climate talks believe progress can be made on a global plan called reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation -lrb- redd -rrb- in which rich countries would fund rewards for developing and poor nations like brazil , indonesia and several in africa , such as rwanda , that save and restore forests .
google said it hoped its tool would help speed cooperation in redd , which could lead to further global agreements on climate .

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .

even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "

meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .
the study also revealed a more prevalent anti-jewish undercurrent in germany than in other western european countries .
a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are critical of women 's rights in islam while 50 percent of danes and two-thirds of the french and dutch respondents approved of the building of mosques , fewer than 30 percent of germans said they did .
in denmark , france and the netherlands , a clear majority of respondents viewed muslims positively .
in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a family 's seventh child automatically gets a bonus godfather - the german president .
but what happens when the family has extremist views ? for president christian wulff , a run-of-the-mill process honoring a slightly antiquated german custom has turned into something of a political minefield .
under a law established in 1949 , while germany sought to replenish its population and workforce after world war ii , a family 's seventh child automatically has the right to a special bonus godfather - the german president .
this routine procedure , which also includes a 500 euro -lrb- $ 658 -rrb- reward , applies to any seventh child .
however , president wulff 's decision to honor the custom for an allegedly neo-nazi family in the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania has solicited strong opposition .
after a few days deliberating , wulff 's office issued a statement saying that the godfather decision ultimately concerned the newborn child , not the family or their political background . " it 's everyone 's responsibility to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up to adhere to democratic principles , " wulff also said .
local opposition the social minister for the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , manuela schwesig , said she was disappointed with wulff 's statement and that he should have more clearly distanced himself from the alleged political stance of the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local politicians advised against the honor because of the family 's far-right ties " instead of issuing a general appeal to everyone to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up according to democratic principles , it would have been more courageous to issue a direct challenge to the parents in this specific instance , " schwesig said on thursday .
regional politicians on all sides have said that the family in question was closely tied to the far-right scene in germany .
extremism experts in germany have said they were friends of the high-profile lawyer and member of the far-right npd party , juergen rieger , who died in 2009 .
the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- said the mother was a member of an organization with close ties to the npd whose name roughly translates as " the ring of national women . "
" we ca n't fight against far-right culture in our schools and local projects and then give out state honors to such people , " the local authorities in krakow am see , responsible for the family 's hometown of lalendorf , said in a statement .
a truly extended family the german president is set to travel to the region on thursday on unrelated business , although it seems unlikely he would visit his controversial new godchild , who is but one of many .
german heads of state have been honorary godfathers to 76,440 children since the law 's inception in 1949 .
parents can apply for the honor - which is usually a formality - as soon as their seventh babe is born .

the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .
the study also revealed a more prevalent anti-jewish undercurrent in germany than in other western european countries .
a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are critical of women 's rights in islam while 50 percent of danes and two-thirds of the french and dutch respondents approved of the building of mosques , fewer than 30 percent of germans said they did .
in denmark , france and the netherlands , a clear majority of respondents viewed muslims positively .
in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

it will be the first time a country in eastern europe has hosted the soccer tournament . russian president dmitry medvedev wrote " hurray ! " on his blog , as the news that russia had been selected to host the 2018 world cup was announced .
" hurray !
victory ! " the president wrote on twitter , moments after fifa president sepp blatter announced the result of the executive committee 's vote in zurich .
" now we have to really prepare the way we stage the world cup .
and , of course , put up a deserving performance , " medvedev wrote .
so far the russian football team has not made it past the first round of any world cup campaign .
' russia loves football ' the decision to take football 's biggest tournament - and the world 's most watched event - to russia was a personal victory for russian prime minister vladimir putin , whose idea it was to run for the hosting duties in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian bid team celebrate fifa 's decision in zurich the prime minister had originally boycotted the vote in zurich , saying that after british media allegations of corruption by fifa officials , he wanted to leave the world soccer body alone to make the decision .
shortly after the announcement , putin jumped on a plane to zurich to thank the fifa executive for " trusting " russia .
" in russia we love football , we know about football , and we have everything to ensure that we hold the 2018 world cup in a very worthy way , " putin told reporters .
the prime minister recognized that better stadiums , airports , hotels and roads would be needed but said selecting russia would mean " the development of world soccer . "
putin has been seen as the orchestrator of bringing both the 2014 winter olympics and a formula one grand prix home to his country .
' a huge celebration ' russia has a massive building project to prepare for the world cup , including proposals for 13 brand new stadiums .
the construction project is budgeted at 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.82 billion -rrb- - the largest figure among the four european bidders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister putin is said to be the powerhouse behind russia 's bid yet despite economic fears , the majority of opinion in russia has been one of quiet confidence about hosting the tournament .
" it 's only a game , but you feel you are at the center of the world , " said russian sports broadcaster wassilij utkin .
" there are not many events in the world as big as this , " he added .
even russian opposition politicians , such as ilya yashin , were clearly ecstatic by the news .
" as a fan , i 'm feeling some fantastic emotions , " said the young politician .
" the best teams in the whole world will be coming to russia and it means a huge celebration for our country . "
new territory for fifa russia won the rights to host the 2018 world cup after a secret ballot of 22 fifa officials , beating european competition from england and joint spain / portugal and belgium / netherlands bids .
the host for the 2022 world cup was also decided in zurich on thursday , with the vote going to the small arab nation of qatar .
fifa president blatter said he was delighted football was going " to new lands . "
" never has the world cup been in russia and eastern europe , and the middle east and arabic world have been waiting for a long time , so i 'm a happy president when we talk about the development of football , " said blatter .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 02.12.2010 germany to focus on european space missions , abandon national moon plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is giving up its national sights on the moon despite a tight budget , germany aims to increase investment in space science and technology to fuel innovation and growth through the auspices of the european space agency rather than its own national space program . the german government said this week it would step up public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

" compared to france , the netherlands and denmark , there is a more rigid and intolerant understanding of extrinsic religions in germany , " pollack said .
most germans entirely disagree with a recent statement by president christian wulff that islam " belongs to germany , " he added .
the study also revealed a more prevalent anti-jewish undercurrent in germany than in other western european countries .
a little more than 28 percent of west germans and 29 percent of east germans had negative attitudes about jews , the survey found .
this compared to about 10 percent in the netherlands , 12 percent in denmark , and nearly 21 percent in france .
the figures and comparisons were also similar for other religions , such as hinduism and buddhism . germans view islam as ‘ intolerant ' the representative survey , which polled 1,000 people in each of the four countries mentioned , found that fewer than five percent of germans thought islam was a tolerant religion , compared to roughly 20 percent for the danes , dutch and french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are critical of women 's rights in islam while 50 percent of danes and two-thirds of the french and dutch respondents approved of the building of mosques , fewer than 30 percent of germans said they did .
in denmark , france and the netherlands , a clear majority of respondents viewed muslims positively .
in germany , however , only 34 percent of those surveyed in the west of the country and 26 percent in eastern germany had a positive view of muslims .
when asked what they associated with islam , more than 80 percent said discrimination of women , 60 percent said fanaticism , and only eight percent of west germans and five percent of east germans said that islam was peaceful .

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 02.12.2010 germany to focus on european space missions , abandon national moon plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is giving up its national sights on the moon despite a tight budget , germany aims to increase investment in space science and technology to fuel innovation and growth through the auspices of the european space agency rather than its own national space program . the german government said this week it would step up public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .
" we 've always had more good ideas than we 've had money and it will probably stay that way in the future .
besides , it would be sad if we lost our imagination . "

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .

no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .

the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .

5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .

no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .

a family 's seventh child automatically gets a bonus godfather - the german president .
but what happens when the family has extremist views ? for president christian wulff , a run-of-the-mill process honoring a slightly antiquated german custom has turned into something of a political minefield .
under a law established in 1949 , while germany sought to replenish its population and workforce after world war ii , a family 's seventh child automatically has the right to a special bonus godfather - the german president .
this routine procedure , which also includes a 500 euro -lrb- $ 658 -rrb- reward , applies to any seventh child .
however , president wulff 's decision to honor the custom for an allegedly neo-nazi family in the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania has solicited strong opposition .
after a few days deliberating , wulff 's office issued a statement saying that the godfather decision ultimately concerned the newborn child , not the family or their political background . " it 's everyone 's responsibility to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up to adhere to democratic principles , " wulff also said .
local opposition the social minister for the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , manuela schwesig , said she was disappointed with wulff 's statement and that he should have more clearly distanced himself from the alleged political stance of the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local politicians advised against the honor because of the family 's far-right ties " instead of issuing a general appeal to everyone to create an atmosphere in which children can be brought up according to democratic principles , it would have been more courageous to issue a direct challenge to the parents in this specific instance , " schwesig said on thursday .
regional politicians on all sides have said that the family in question was closely tied to the far-right scene in germany .
extremism experts in germany have said they were friends of the high-profile lawyer and member of the far-right npd party , juergen rieger , who died in 2009 .
the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- said the mother was a member of an organization with close ties to the npd whose name roughly translates as " the ring of national women . "
" we ca n't fight against far-right culture in our schools and local projects and then give out state honors to such people , " the local authorities in krakow am see , responsible for the family 's hometown of lalendorf , said in a statement .
a truly extended family the german president is set to travel to the region on thursday on unrelated business , although it seems unlikely he would visit his controversial new godchild , who is but one of many .
german heads of state have been honorary godfathers to 76,440 children since the law 's inception in 1949 .
parents can apply for the honor - which is usually a formality - as soon as their seventh babe is born .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de weather -pipe- 02.12.2010 winter weather causes deaths , travel disruptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercury has hardly had to spread itself thin this december as europeans suffer from the first cold snap of the winter , travelers have been facing delays and cancelations .
deaths were reported in germany , poland , lithuania and the czech republic . an early cold snap , along with heavy snowfall and ice , has been wreaking havoc across northern europe , causing deaths and bringing travel in many countries to a standstill .
three people were killed in germany overnight wednesday in road accidents caused by the weather .
in poland , where temperatures have dropped to as low as minus 33 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 27.4 fahrenheit -rrb- , the freezing weather has claimed 18 lives , officials said on thursday .
in neighboring lithuania and the czech republic , an additional eight deaths were reported .

" complacency is not an option .
there are lessons to be learned from our performance in every bout of bad weather and it is important that we learn those now . "

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a tough - and icy - match for stuttgart david degen opened up the scoring for bern in the 35th minute , but goals by pawel progrebnjak and sven schipplock brought stuttgart back into the game .
scott sutter leveled the score in the 78th minute , however , and emmanuel mayuka sealed the deal with two goals in two minutes near the end of the match .
with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

it 's the first time the executive committee - who cast their votes to determine the outcome - has ever been asked to pick two world cup venues in one session .
however , the committee 's numbers have already been thinned out due to one corruption scandal , and others are still hanging over fifa 's head , threatening to spoil the party for the zurich-based organization .
here 's a rundown of the stories fifa would like to disappear on world cup selection day : cash for votes description : executive committee members reynald temarii and amos adamu were filmed offering pledges to vote for the united states ' 2022 bid in exchange for financial considerations .
temarii , a tahitian who represents the oceania football confederation -lrb- ofc -rrb- on the committee , asked men whom he believed were representatives of the us bid - but who were actually reporters working for the sunday times of london - for 3 million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.7 million euros , 2.3 million us dollars -rrb- so he could build a soccer academy in auckland .
confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- representative adamu requested 800,000 us dollars -lrb- 610,000 euros -rrb- - half paid in advance - in order to lay four artificial football pitches in his home country , nigeria .
sanction : temarii was suspended from football for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- , adamu barred for three years and fined 10,000 francs .
significance : high , in that it means two less people voting on thursday , altering the formula for garnering enough committee votes to win the right to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teixeira was once investigated by brazil 's senate isl 's secret payments description : issa hayatou , the cameroonian head of caf , brazil 's ricardo teixeira , and paraguay 's nicolas leoz , the head of south american confederation conmebol , have been accused of accepting bribes during the 1990s from the now-defunct sports marketing firm isl .
the bbc news magazine program " panorama " and swiss newspaper tages-anzeiger have said say they possess isl documents that show hayatou was paid 100,000 french francs -lrb- 15,200 euros -rrb- , leoz was paid $ 730,000 , and teixeira was paid $ 9.5 million via a shell company in liechtenstein .
sanction : none as yet .
fifa considers accusations related to its former media rights partner isl to be closed , but the international olympic committee , where hayatou is also a board member , may see things differently .
significance : in the short run , the claims will probably do little but harm england 's chances of landing the 2018 cup .
if these three voters had been considering voting for england , they 're now unlikely to do so since the corruption allegations were aired by the bbc .
in the long run , they could prove critical in cleaning up fifa , should any kind of outside investigation go forward .
the alleged instances of wrongdoing are up to two decades old , but the sums of money are massive - a ledger of similar payments made by isl - whose recipients remain unknown - total over 100 million us dollars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time warner is in trouble ticketgate description : trinidad and tobago 's jack warner , a fifa vice president and the head of concacaf - the confederation of caribbean , north and central american football - has been accused of again breaking fifa rules regulating the resale of word cup tickets .
" panorama , " along with the danish sporting newspaper tipsbladet , reported that warner bought more than 84,000 us dollars worth of tickets to the world cup in south africa so as to re-sell them to scalpers .
sanction : none as yet .
but since warner was caught doing much the same thing during the 2006 world cup in germany - and fined by fifa for it - he may be punished again .
significance : potentially great .
warner is believed to exert great influence over the way his concacaf colleagues chuck blazer -lrb- usa -rrb- and rafael salguero -lrb- guatemala -rrb- will vote , and thus has been courted assiduously by a number of 2018 bids .
the bbc program may have been enough of an embarrassment to move those three votes away from england and toward russia or spain / portugal .
the effect on the vote for the 2022 host is less significant as the three men are expected to favor the us , the only bid from within concacaf 's ranks .
longer-term , warner is thought to be a major power broker in the 2011 race for the fifa presidency , likely to pit incumbent sepp blatter against qatar 's mohamed bin hammam .
if warner were to be suspended , that race could be blown wide open .

both countries will be hosting world football 's biggest competition for the first time . russia will host the world cup in 2018 , with qatar to host the 2022 competition run by world soccer body fifa . " the 2018 fifa world cup , ladies and gentlemen , will be organized in russia , " fifa president sepp blatter said while making the announcement , delivered to him by the public notary of the city of zurich . shortly afterwards , blatter went on to announce the second choice , in the first double decision on world cup venues in fifa 's history . " the winner to organize the 2022 world cup is qatar , " he said . " i have to make big , big compliments to all the bidders … for the big job they have done and for the messages they have delivered , " blatter said in his address . " in football , we learn to win , and that 's easy .
but in football , we also learn to lose , and that 's not so easy . " a thinned-out panel of 22 fifa executive committee members - with two absentees due to recent corruption allegations - reached the decision at the organization 's headquarters in zurich on thursday afternoon . confident russia wins european rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ambitious russian fans might be dreaming of a 2018 victory the russian success came at the expense of joint bids from spain and portugal and from belgium and the netherlands , as well as a push for the tournament from england . russian prime minister vladimir putin , who spearheaded the country 's early push for the competition , did not attend the ceremony in zurich .
he said he was confident his country would win anyway , and that he did n't want to put additional pressure on fifa members , accusing rivals england of launching a " smear campaign " against soccer 's governing body . putin was apparently alluding to an investigative journalism feature on corruption within the organization , aired on the bbc days before the decision . after the announcement , putin said he would fly to zurich on thursday night to thank fifa and its executive committee . russia , like fellow victors qatar , has never hosted a world cup before .
the country is something of a new frontier for world football .
its national team 's success in reaching the semi-final of the 2008 european championships - stewarded by international coaching guru guus hiddink - helped catapult the country onto the soccer radar .
however , the side failed to qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa . star-studded qatar bid triumphs the small , oil-rich gulf state of qatar has neither a rich footballing heritage nor a strong national team , but it will be the first country from the region to host a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zinedine zidane , the hero of the 1998 world cup , was among qatar 's ambassadors the country sought out a stellar list of ambassadors to promote its cause .
french world cup winning hero zinedine zidane was perhaps the most famous , and he was joined by the fabled dutch defender ronald de boer , cameroon 's goal-machine roger milla , barcelona coach and former spain international josep guardiola , and argentine goal-poacher gabriel batistuta , among others .
even those outside the soccer scene , like long-time formula one team owner sir frank williams , offered their support to qatar 's bid . qatar secured the 2022 tournament over bids from the united states , australia , japan and south korea . in its final pitch , the country sought to reassure officials that players would compete in perfect conditions , promising air-conditioned stadiums to ward off the scorching summer heat in the region . " all our stadiums , training sites and fan zones will be at 27 degrees celsius -lrb- 80 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , all solar-powered and 100 percent carbon neutral , " the qatar bid ceo hassan al-thawadi said .
" the application for this technology goes far beyond stadiums . " it 's perhaps fitting that the 2018 and 2022 world cups are breaking new ground , considering that the next competition in 2014 will be played out in one of football 's spiritual homes - brazil . author : mark hallam -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 02.12.2010 german future prize goes to grappler developer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research leader peter post with the grappler in a dw interview , peter post , a german innovator explains the bionic grappler , a high-tech helper modeled after an elephant 's trunk . on wednesday evening , the festo company and its bionic handling assistant were awarded germany 's annual future prize at a ceremony in berlin .
the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 02.12.2010 german future prize goes to grappler developer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research leader peter post with the grappler in a dw interview , peter post , a german innovator explains the bionic grappler , a high-tech helper modeled after an elephant 's trunk . on wednesday evening , the festo company and its bionic handling assistant were awarded germany 's annual future prize at a ceremony in berlin .
the bionic handling assistant , as it 's called , was inspired by the the elephant 's trunk , which has over 40,000 muscle fibers at its disposal to achieve such great flexibility .
peter post , head of r esearch at the festo company and project spokesman of the bionic handling development team , said the invention was " a completely new assistance system compared to conventional robots " and could be used in assembly processes in industry , as well as to aid impaired indiviuals .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the inventor outlined what this new product aims to achieve .
deutsche welle : dr. post , you have created a flexible grappler , or high-tech grip , that was modeled after an elephant trunk .
how does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accordion-like design enables more flexibility peter post : we used structures layered one behind another that can move like an accordian .
when air is blown into them , each individual element can extend itself .
a tremendous amount of mobility results when they all work together , giving the grappler eleven different possibilities for connected movement .
release of the air occurs in the corresponding chambers by which we achieve the same mobility and flexibility of an elephant 's trunk .
but unlike with an elephant 's trunk , we can even extend the grappler .
what is so innovative about your invention ?
what does the trunk allow us to do that was n't possible in the past ?
with this bionic handling assistent , we 're entering into a whole new era of service robotics .
until now , service robotic systems have been rigid structures that have to be softened through adjustment settings .
but with our invention , the core element has a very soft and flexible structure which can be used in interaction with humans without any additional security measures .
we " harden " the trunk , or rather , make it move through appropriate optomatic / automatic controls and the intelligence inherent in that . in other words , this trunk can do that things that only humans could previously perform ?
more than anything , this grappler can aid interaction between human beings and technology .
until now , for safety reasons , robotic systems normally had to work far removed from people .
the new system allows closer interaction , and due to its relatively simple construction and a special manufacturing process , we can develop the entire system very inexpensively - within a range that private individuals could afford .
in what areas can the grappler be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post -lrb- center -rrb- and his team we 've attached it to a mobile platform , for example , so it can be sent off to fetch things .
it can also be used in the many places where people 's movements are restricted - it can be attached to a wheelchair , for instance , and controlled via a joystick .
the assistant can also be used as a kind of third arm and supplement one 's own body movements .
we envision the handling assistent being used in industrial processes like assembly , and in laboratories and repair shops .
someone working in one of these areas , then , would get a " third hand " to help him or her out in certain areas .
how successful has your handling assistant been on the market ?
we 're just in the initial phase .
we have final prototypes that can now be put to test in real situations , and can give us an idea of their range of application and how that can be broadened .
we can learn from these experiences and let that flow into the serial development process .
how did you come up with the idea of imitating an elephant 's trunk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine touch of the handling assistant makes interaction with humans possible that 's not an idea that just pops into your head under the shower .
instead , you have to systematize the search for ways of transposing biological principles into technology .
that requires looking at the way nature works - and how it solves this or that problem .
then you try copying the system in technology in order to understand it .
in the next stage , we contemplate how technical structures can be built which take advantage of nature 's problem-solving principles .
surely many different scientific disciplines are applied to that end ?
correct .
the process can only work in an interdisciplinary way .
teams have to cooperate ; people have to work well together , listen and understand each other .
in the end , innovations develop at the points where the sciences and technical disciplines merge and connect .
even beyond the boundaries of a company , and in conjunction with universities and research institutes .
for instance , we worked with the frauenhofer institute in stuttgart .
what does receiving the german innovation prize mean to you ?
it is a huge honor .
i think something like that can only happen once in a lifetime .
as people say , it 's really the " oscar " of technology .

the result sets up a showdown in seville which dortmund must win to move on . borussia dortmund went into thursday 's match against karpaty lviv with a very clear task in front of them : with two europa league group stage matches remaining , the german side had to win both to stand any chance of progressing to the knockout stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's shinji kagawa of japan celebrates his opening goal and the runaway bundesliga league leaders , who have had no problems racking up victories in domestic competition , jumped the first hurdle with ease , dispatching karpaty lviv 3-0 on home turf .
even in inclement weather conditions , lviv , who have no points to their name after five successive europa league defeats , could n't really compete with dortmund 's class .
dortmund went ahead from an early corner after five minutes through japanese off-season bargain shinji kagawa - and had several chances to extend their lead in the opening half .
" the first half an hour was outstanding , " dortmund 's sporting director michael zorc said during the half-time break .
" but what i did n't like is that we had four of five golden opportunities and yet the score 's still 1-0 .
that 's a joke . "
paris st. germain play their part zorc 's concerns were soothed shortly after the break , when mats hummels put dortmund two ahead in the 49th minute , heading home a swirling free-kick from russian midfielder nuri sahin .
and sahin secured a hat trick of assists in the dying minutes of the match , setting up polish striker robert lewandowski , who finished coolly with his left foot .
meanwhile , in france , group j leaders paris st. germain played their part in keeping dortmund 's european dream afloat , beating sevilla 4-2 and setting up what is effectively a knock-out match between the spanish and german sides .
had sevilla won thursday 's game in paris , dortmund 's prospects would have been far more bleak .
" now we have the ' final ' we were hoping for , " dortmund goal-scorer shinji kagawa said after the game , on hearing news of the day 's other result .
" it 's nice that our fate is now back in our own hands . "
dortmund , who are currently third in group j , face second-placed sevilla in spain on december 15 .
while dortmund must win , for sevilla , who still have a one point advantage over their german adversaries , a draw would suffice to move into the knockout stage .
" we want to play our very best football in seville , otherwise we 'll have no chance of winning , " german international mats hummels told reporters on the snow-covered pitch in dortmund .
" it will be an interesting game . "

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

this includes mara radovanovic who oversees a woman 's shelter in bosnia . even 12-year-old girls from good families can end up forced into prostitution in bosnia .
first the pimps spy on a girl and figure out who in her family she loves the most .
then they tell her they 're going to kill that very person if she refuses to work as a prostitute for them .
that 's according to mara radovanovic of the women 's organization lara in bosnia , which is now supported by the international organization care .
radovanovic has established a network to fight human trafficking and set up a women 's shelter in a secret location where she cares for victims .
high-level johns other girls are drugged and then gang raped in motels .

radovanovic told deutsche welle that even supposed " leaders " of bosnian society are involved in these crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the men involved are in positions of power that was the case of one roma girl in her shelter , who comes from a village near the eastern town of srebrenica .
" she was abused by teachers and the local police , " radovanovic said .
" even the bosnian security minister was involved . "
the girl testified against the minister in the shelter , which has directly felt the results .
" in the past we got funding from the security ministry , but since then the support has stopped , " radovanovic said .
she said she did n't expect any more funds as long as that particular politician is in power .
he had claimed to have met with the girl to give her a scholarship for school .
because the girl has a photographic memory , she was able to describe all the details of the minister 's car to the police , thus proving that she really had been lured into his car , and not for educational purposes .
a new trend going after local bosnian girls is the new trend for organized crime in the region , according to radovanovic .
up until 2005 , most of the victims were foreign girls and women who were lured from across eastern europe by alleged job offers in the west .
instead of ending up working as a babysitter or waitress in germany , however , they were then carried off to the balkans and forced to work as prostitutes .
awareness efforts from a few brave activists have now brought this issue into the public consciousness .
today bosnian border guards and police officers are better trained to identify these trafficking victims , which also reduces the number of foreign victims in the country .
a risky fight victims of forced prostitution and human trafficking can only be help , radovanovic said , if the state intervenes .
" the most important thing is to force our government to provide the resources for the rehabilitation of these victims , " she said .
" school scholarships for example .
because otherwise they ca n't be helped in the long term . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia has those trying to help in their sights the bosnian government has one response : there 's no money available .
but radovanovic will keep fighting for the victims , she said , even though she 's besieged by threats from the bosnian mafia and it 's almost impossible to protect them .
radovanovic 's organization may have the support of european police forces and the organization for security and cooperation in europe , but she says silence is often what keeps her and her colleagues safe .
" the most important thing is the following : we know that the criminals are out there that would be very quick to kill someone , " she said .
" so even if we have evidence against someone , we keep this knowledge to ourselves .
knowledge is the best way for us to protect ourselves - anything else would mean certain death . "

that victory sends them into the knockout stages of the europa league , europe 's second-tier football competition . the last time bayer leverkusen met norwegian side rosenborg trondheim for the europea league it was early fall in germany and leverkusen cleaned up with a 4-0 victory .
on wednesday night they did it again with a 1-0 win , despite the frigid temperature of minus 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 5 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
a single goal by bayer leverkusen 's sidney sam in the 35th minute was enough to beat trondheim and lock in the top spot in their europa league group , making their scheduled december 16 match against atletico madrid irrelevant .
" all in all the team did well as expected , clinching a deserved win , " said coach jupp heynckes .
stuttgart 's first europa league loss also playing in freezing conditions in bern , switzerland , stuttgart squandered an early lead to eventually lose 4-2 to young boys bern - the first loss in their europa league campaign . the beginning of the match was delayed for half an hour while snow was cleared from the artificial pitch and the players got another break at the 29th minute after the field markings had been obscured by more snow .

with the win bern secured their spot in the knockout stage , which stuttgart had already done in the fourth match of the competition .
in addition to bern and leverkusen , five other teams also booked their spots in the next round on wednesday : psv eindhoven , sporting lisbon , lech poznan , metalist kharkiv and manchester city .
current champions atletico madrid suffered a shock loss but are still in the running , while two-time european champion juventus crashed with a draw against lech poznan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy crime -pipe- 02.12.2010 us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange could face serious charges in the us the pressure on wikileaks founder julian assange is mounting .
not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

the two may have also used a racy find to extort a young star . two young men in germany are being investigated for hacking the computers of pop stars like justin timberlake , lady gaga , ke $ ha and kelly clarkson to obtain and then sell unreleased music files .
police have found evidence that the 17-year-old and 23-year-old from western germany used trojan viruses to infect computers associated with the singers , enabling them to download the files , confirmed ralf haferkamp of the duisburg prosecutor 's office in an interview with deutsche welle .
members of a kelly clarkson fan club became suspicious after the young men offered to sell them new and commercially unavailable songs via an online platform .
the club members contacted clarkson 's management , who in turn notified the police .
" the investigation could result in charges relating to commercial copyright violations , which carry a penalty of up to five years in jail , " haferkamp told deutsche welle .
" since one of the hackers is 17 years old , he could face a similar punishment in a detention center for young offenders . "
more than money at stake authorities estimate that the hackers may have pocketed up to five-figure revenues from selling the illegal files , but turning a quick profit appears not to have been their only motive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer ke $ ha is alleged to have given in to the hackers ' blackmail demands the two may face additional charges for obtaining a sex photo of one singer and blackmailing the star with the item in exchange for a public shoutout for a dj .
a racy photo of 23-year-old pop american pop star ke $ ha has since appeared on the website of a dj sharing the same stage one as one of the accused hackers .
internet tabloids and blogs have been following the alleged blackmail incident , but authorities handling the investigation are unable to confirm or deny the rumors that ke $ ha was the performer involved .
lady gaga 's laptop ?
the files stemmed from a variety of computers , including those belonging to managers and others close to the performers but not necessarily from the singers ' personal devices .
" i ca n't say whether the laptop sitting on lady gaga 's nightstand was among them , but i think that 's pretty unlikely , " haferkamp told the dpa news agency .
the hackers have already widely confessed to the charges , and authorities expect the investigation to continue until early next year .
for now , the two young men , who each live at home with their parents , are not in custody .

it 's the first time the executive committee - who cast their votes to determine the outcome - has ever been asked to pick two world cup venues in one session .
however , the committee 's numbers have already been thinned out due to one corruption scandal , and others are still hanging over fifa 's head , threatening to spoil the party for the zurich-based organization .
here 's a rundown of the stories fifa would like to disappear on world cup selection day : cash for votes description : executive committee members reynald temarii and amos adamu were filmed offering pledges to vote for the united states ' 2022 bid in exchange for financial considerations .
temarii , a tahitian who represents the oceania football confederation -lrb- ofc -rrb- on the committee , asked men whom he believed were representatives of the us bid - but who were actually reporters working for the sunday times of london - for 3 million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.7 million euros , 2.3 million us dollars -rrb- so he could build a soccer academy in auckland .
confederation of african football -lrb- caf -rrb- representative adamu requested 800,000 us dollars -lrb- 610,000 euros -rrb- - half paid in advance - in order to lay four artificial football pitches in his home country , nigeria .
sanction : temarii was suspended from football for one year and fined 5,000 swiss francs -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- , adamu barred for three years and fined 10,000 francs .
significance : high , in that it means two less people voting on thursday , altering the formula for garnering enough committee votes to win the right to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teixeira was once investigated by brazil 's senate isl 's secret payments description : issa hayatou , the cameroonian head of caf , brazil 's ricardo teixeira , and paraguay 's nicolas leoz , the head of south american confederation conmebol , have been accused of accepting bribes during the 1990s from the now-defunct sports marketing firm isl .
the bbc news magazine program " panorama " and swiss newspaper tages-anzeiger have said say they possess isl documents that show hayatou was paid 100,000 french francs -lrb- 15,200 euros -rrb- , leoz was paid $ 730,000 , and teixeira was paid $ 9.5 million via a shell company in liechtenstein .
sanction : none as yet .
fifa considers accusations related to its former media rights partner isl to be closed , but the international olympic committee , where hayatou is also a board member , may see things differently .
significance : in the short run , the claims will probably do little but harm england 's chances of landing the 2018 cup .
if these three voters had been considering voting for england , they 're now unlikely to do so since the corruption allegations were aired by the bbc .
in the long run , they could prove critical in cleaning up fifa , should any kind of outside investigation go forward .
the alleged instances of wrongdoing are up to two decades old , but the sums of money are massive - a ledger of similar payments made by isl - whose recipients remain unknown - total over 100 million us dollars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time warner is in trouble ticketgate description : trinidad and tobago 's jack warner , a fifa vice president and the head of concacaf - the confederation of caribbean , north and central american football - has been accused of again breaking fifa rules regulating the resale of word cup tickets .
" panorama , " along with the danish sporting newspaper tipsbladet , reported that warner bought more than 84,000 us dollars worth of tickets to the world cup in south africa so as to re-sell them to scalpers .
sanction : none as yet .
but since warner was caught doing much the same thing during the 2006 world cup in germany - and fined by fifa for it - he may be punished again .
significance : potentially great .
warner is believed to exert great influence over the way his concacaf colleagues chuck blazer -lrb- usa -rrb- and rafael salguero -lrb- guatemala -rrb- will vote , and thus has been courted assiduously by a number of 2018 bids .
the bbc program may have been enough of an embarrassment to move those three votes away from england and toward russia or spain / portugal .
the effect on the vote for the 2022 host is less significant as the three men are expected to favor the us , the only bid from within concacaf 's ranks .
longer-term , warner is thought to be a major power broker in the 2011 race for the fifa presidency , likely to pit incumbent sepp blatter against qatar 's mohamed bin hammam .
if warner were to be suspended , that race could be blown wide open .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy crime -pipe- 02.12.2010 us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange could face serious charges in the us the pressure on wikileaks founder julian assange is mounting .
not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .
" we 've always had more good ideas than we 've had money and it will probably stay that way in the future .
besides , it would be sad if we lost our imagination . "

dw-world.de space official proposes billion-euro german moon mission a german government official has called for the country to launch an unmanned mission to the moon by 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy crime -pipe- 02.12.2010 us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange could face serious charges in the us the pressure on wikileaks founder julian assange is mounting .
not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .
there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .
hamburg showed what they are capable of against stuttgart last week , ending a run of two straight defeats and lifting them two places into seventh .
the momentum appears to be with hamburg – but it 'll be close .
prediction : 1-0 hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a long , hard winter for magath 's schalke schalke – bayern if schalke approach this huge match like a champions league game then we could be in for a classic .
if they go into it in the same frame of mind that they 've had for most of their bundesliga campaign to date , this will be a massacre .
the 5-0 thumping at kaiserslautern quickly dispelled the euphoria surrounding the previous result , a 3-0 victory over lyon .
with bayern unbeaten in seven games and notching 18 goals during that run , the schalke defense need to be the organized unit they 've been in europe , not the shoddy mess we 've seen in the league .
if bayern turn up in the mood to run riot , this could be a very uncomfortable afternoon for former bayern boss felix magath .
prediction : 3-1 bayern .
sunday , dec .
5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .
juergen klopp 's team has dropped a total of 4 points on the season thus far and have won five straight .
no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .
home advantage would usually count for something but with bvb on such a roll , it 's unlikely anything will help .
prediction : 3-0 dortmund .

there 's no shame in losing to dortmund this season and last week 's defeat at hanover said more about their opponents ’ form than their own .

5 leverkusen – cologne this rhine derby pits neighbors against each other at a time when they occupy opposite ends of the table .
leverkusen missed the chance to creep closer to the summit with a hard-fought draw against hoffenheim last week while cologne did well to keep wolfsburg at bay in their own stalemate .
cologne have only managed three wins this season so far while leverkusen have lost just twice .
the form card suggests that leverkusen are favorites for maximum points here – but then cologne have proved to be obstinate opposition at times , parking the bus at the back and stifling attacking teams to earn valuable points .
this could be another example of cologne utilizing their anti-football .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's relentlessness is leaving the pack behind nuremberg – dortmund the yellow-and-black points machine rolls into nuremberg on sunday , with dortmund unbeaten since the first day of the season .

no one looks forward to taking them on at the moment , especially if you 're a team on a three game losing streak .
nuremberg have slipped to tenth after hitting a high of sixth and were soundly beaten away to mainz last weekend in a display which will put dortmund 's attack on alert .
home advantage would usually count for something but with bvb on such a roll , it 's unlikely anything will help .

good luck with that ... friday , dec .
3 st. pauli – kaiserslautern one late summer day in august , kaiserslautern sat on top of the bundesliga – which now seems a long time ago indeed .
in the three months that have followed the “ lautern top ! ” headines on the second match day of the season , they 've not seen a sniff of the summit since .
but after bottoming out in 15th place , kaiserslautern seem to hit recovery mode .
the 5-0 demolition of schalke last week will have given them even more confidence .
st. pauli should be wary .
the minnows from hamburg ’ s red light quarter are themselves teetering ominously over the relegation zone after their own fall from grace .
a kaiserslautern side in the mood seen against schalke will push them over the edge .
prediction : 2-0 kaiserslautern saturday , dec .
4 stuttgart – hoffenheim after propping up the league for the first third of the season , it then looked for a while like stuttgart had solved enough of their problems to get out of danger .
turns out , maybe not - this is still a team with issues , as seen in last week 's implosion in hamburg .
the tractor beam of relegation has vfb back in its grip after three games without a win .
meanwhile , hoffenheim have looked very good at times but have so far failed to capitalize on the topsy-turvy nature of this season , slipping up when a leap up the table was possible due to the results of others .
this inconsistency is slowly ruling them out of the running but they should still by too strong for stuttgart .
prediction : 3-1 hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's hero hugo almeida listens to the sighs of relief wolfsburg – bremen after a rollercoaster ride so far , wolfsburg seem to have found their natural place in the bundesliga this season – unfortunately , that place appears to be the lower reaches of the table .
after recovering from a nightmare start , the wolves rose to sixth before plummeting again .
now they seem to be catching their breath in 13th .
for a team which appears to be one of the more talented on paper , this is n't good enough .
this goes doubly for bremen who have somehow forgotten they are one of germany 's better teams and have decided that mediocrity suits them better .
a good 3-0 win over st. pauli last week should have been routine .
instead hugo almeida 's hat-trick prompted a sigh of relief .
it 's hard to pull these two underachievers apart .
prediction : 2-2 frankfurt – mainz the blip mainz have recently experienced may just be enough to rule them out as potential title winners but they 're still in second after arresting a run of three defeats by winning their last two games .
last week 's win over nuremberg was more accomplished than the previous one over gladbach , which suggests they 're back on track .
frankfurt got trounced at bayern last week , letting in four for the second consecutive week .
if mainz have rediscovered their killer instinct and frankfurt 's defense really have had the stuffing knocked out of them then thomas tuchel 's high-flyers will keep their distant pace with league leaders dortmund .
prediction : 2-0 mainz moenchengladbach – hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schulz -lrb- r . -rrb- and his hannover colleagues battle on hanover for the title ?
no chance .
hanover for the champions league ?
that could be worth a flutter .
after going down to consecutive 4-0 defeats , hanover have put together a run of three victories which have hauled them back into the european places after slipping from third to tenth .
now in fourth and with a trio of resilient wins under their belts , hanover could force their way into third again should leverkusen – one place above them – lose and they beat gladbach .
given that their opponents have now bedded themselves in at the bottom of the league , hannover stand a good chance of doing their bit .
the foals , meanwhile , have been beaten by two of the top four so far already and are likely to make it three out of four this weekend .
prediction : 3-0 hannover freiburg – hamburg freiburg 's wings have been clipped of late but their flight up the league has still taken them high enough that a couple of defeats wo n't send them nose-diving into trouble .

the world health organization has stepped up its research . global warming – and the consequent change in weather and rainfall patterns – is complicating matters for the world health organization in its fight against malaria in asia . the countries which are most at risk in the asia-pacific region are india , myanmar , bangladesh and indonesia . according to world health organization figures , two million people are at risk of contracting the illness .
overall , asia accounts for more than 60 percent of the global population risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malaria patients at a cambodian hospital malaria parasite could spread increasingly extreme climate conditions are fueling fears the malaria parasite could spread .
this was the topic of debate at a recent conference in bangkok . " global warming is of course going to increase the conditions for mosquitoes to thrive . " explained dr eva-maria christophel , a who official based in the philippines . " there is a lot of reason to worry , " she said , explaining that the change in weather conditions could lead to the areas where malaria can thrive becoming larger . right now , a more pressing concern for the who is that there are increasing signs of growing drug resistance to malaria in parts of cambodia , thailand , myanmar and vietnam . increasing resistance to artemisinin-based drugs in recent years , the main frontline treatment for malaria has been a combination drug based on artemisinin , which is derived from the sweet wormwood plant . but in early 2009 , the who confirmed several cases of resistance to this powerful combination drug on the thai-cambodian border .
recent studies have found that as many as 20 percent of malaria patients in myanmar 's border areas still have parasites in their blood after a normal course of treatment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers on the thai-cambodian border where there are growing signs of drug-resistance clinical trials are currently being conducted to see whether artemisinin-resistant malaria is becoming even more widespread .

the world health organization has stepped up its research . global warming – and the consequent change in weather and rainfall patterns – is complicating matters for the world health organization in its fight against malaria in asia . the countries which are most at risk in the asia-pacific region are india , myanmar , bangladesh and indonesia . according to world health organization figures , two million people are at risk of contracting the illness .
overall , asia accounts for more than 60 percent of the global population risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malaria patients at a cambodian hospital malaria parasite could spread increasingly extreme climate conditions are fueling fears the malaria parasite could spread .
this was the topic of debate at a recent conference in bangkok . " global warming is of course going to increase the conditions for mosquitoes to thrive . " explained dr eva-maria christophel , a who official based in the philippines . " there is a lot of reason to worry , " she said , explaining that the change in weather conditions could lead to the areas where malaria can thrive becoming larger . right now , a more pressing concern for the who is that there are increasing signs of growing drug resistance to malaria in parts of cambodia , thailand , myanmar and vietnam . increasing resistance to artemisinin-based drugs in recent years , the main frontline treatment for malaria has been a combination drug based on artemisinin , which is derived from the sweet wormwood plant . but in early 2009 , the who confirmed several cases of resistance to this powerful combination drug on the thai-cambodian border .
recent studies have found that as many as 20 percent of malaria patients in myanmar 's border areas still have parasites in their blood after a normal course of treatment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers on the thai-cambodian border where there are growing signs of drug-resistance clinical trials are currently being conducted to see whether artemisinin-resistant malaria is becoming even more widespread .

not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well . after interpol went public on wednesday with an alert calling for the arrest of the wikileaks founder in connection with allegations of sex offenses in sweden , assange is now wanted in the 188 countries that are members of the international police organization .
while the sex crimes alleged to have been committed by assange are not connected to the current wikileaks document release of some 250,000 diplomatic cables , the us is investigating separately whether to prosecute assange for publishing the classified files . calls for washington to take action against assange have been increasing ever since the massive data publication started on november 29 , but the us government so far has not officially declared whether and how it will try to build a case against assange and wikileaks .
wikileaks a terrorist organization ?
congressman peter king , the incoming chairman of the influential homeland security committee , went so far as to ask secretary of state hillary clinton to investigate whether wikileaks could be designated a foreign terrorist organization -lrb- fto -rrb- , a move that would give us authorities greater leeway in going after the group .
however , legal experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't believe this will be possible under us law .
" i think it does n't work , even though there 's a lot of venom now directed at wikileaks and at assange personally , " says william c. banks , a law professor and director of the institute for national security and counterterrorism at syracuse university . " i think that the institutional makeup of the organization simply does n't fit the profile of those designated as ftos by the united states . "
jonathan hafetz , a law professor at seton hall university in newark who also serves as a lawyer for guantanamo inmates , concurs that wikileaks ca n't be labeled a foreign terrorist organization under the statute .
the more likely legal basis for the us government to prosecute assange , argue hafetz and banks , would be the so-called espionage act of 1917 .
under the law , explains banks , the us would have to prove three things : one , that he had unauthorized possession of information related to national security ; two that he could bring harm to the us or aid an enemy ; and three that he had willfully kept that information after the us demanded that he return it . strong case banks believes that washington could fulfill all three requirements .
" so as a legal matter , i believe they have a pretty strong case against assange , " says banks .
" i think that assange is vulnerable under the act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder is exploring legal options against assange hafetz remains more skeptical : " there are a couple of potential obstacles there .
the government would have to show that there was harm to national security which could force the government to divulge classified information . "
what 's more , adds hafetz , trying wikileaks under the espionage act poses some " potentially very significant first amendment issues if wikileaks is defined as a media organization like a newspaper . "
the first amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the freedom of the press . first amendment issues " i think there are some real first amendment and freedom of speech consequences and problems trying to prosecute wikileaks for publishing information , " says hafetz .
" in fact , it 's hard to draw the line .
why would they then not prosecute the new york times or the other newspapers ? "
determining whether assange and wikileaks do indeed enjoy first amendment rights and can be considered a media outlet would be a key question if it came to a trial .
of course to prosecute assange , the us would also first have to get jurisdiction over him , meaning he would have to step foot on us soil or be extradited by another country , a process which could also be fraught with difficulties . regardless of whether the us ultimately decides to prosecute assange , both experts emphasize that it is actually more important to plug the source of the leaks . plugging the whole " the more responsible actions i think are to make the information that needs to be secure more secure , " says banks .
" we need to reform our own secrecy laws so that not too much is made classified or secret , which is part of the problem here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us should focus on preventing leaks from occuring in the first place , experts say the us , argues banks , has always over-classified material .
a lot of the information contained in the recent leaks " had no business being held closely in the first place . "
in addition , we should reform " our own criminal laws so that we are not relying on a world war i relic to prosecute a contemporary crime , " says banks .
trying to prevent leaks from happening in the first place is really what the us government should focus its energy on now , adds hafetz .
" at the end of the day , even if wikileaks is prosecuted , it does n't stop another organization from potentially publishing other documents . "

" the government 's new strategy punctuates how central applied space technology is for the future of the country , " said rainer bruederle , germany 's economy minister , in a speech on tuesday .
he presented the space strategy paper at a press conference in berlin .
" satellites have become the backbone of our communication and logistics systems , " he said , stressing how that technology would become increasingly important for weather and environmental monitoring , transportation and telecommunications , and for combatting terrorism .
for cost reasons , there would be a shift away from planning german manned flights to the moon .
almost four years ago , the government had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
getting humans back on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer simulation of esa 's smos climate research satellite peter hintze , government coordinator of german aerospace policy , regretted that manned lunar missions would feel the pinch .
the moon is an archive of the earth , he said , and should continue to undergo research .
" i 'm convinced that people will return to the moon , " he concluded .
although hintze may not be over the moon about this new plan , other government officials put a postive spin on the annoucement .
" but germany is n't giving up its dreams of the moon and space travel , " said johann-dietrich woerner , chairman of the german aerospace center , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the dlr , as it is known in german , frequently works together with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
" we will merely work together with our european partners to that end , " he said .
the country will contribute to european spacecraft and flights , and may cooperate with the united states and japan on space science missions .
other bilateral projects include a climate sciene mission with france called " merlin , " slated for 2014 to map atmospheric methane concentrations around the world .
the german government also said it wanted to create a kind of liability scheme for space .
for example , binding rules should be put in place to prevent space from becoming more clogged with junk .
" a traffic breakdown in space would be catastrophic , " bruederle said , stressing that operators of satellites , for example , should be made to pay and fetch defective units from space .
global leaders in specialized technologies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dated esa simulation of space junk germany currently provides some 637 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- to the esa annually , which organizes european space activities - and is second only to france in terms of contributions .
however , woerner argued that while germany lags behind other countries in its national space budget - after the united states , russia , china , japan and france - it still is the global expert in the area of robotics and radar technology .
he stressed that the goverment 's new strategy is a good one because it " shifts the focus from planning space flights mission-by-mission and focuses more on navigation , rocket and robotics technology , among other things , which is conductive to long-term organization and orientation . "
as far as moon travel goes , woerner said , it 's more than just a pipe dream .
" the moon is still a good idea , and good ideas are extremely important , " woerner noted .
" we 've always had more good ideas than we 've had money and it will probably stay that way in the future .
besides , it would be sad if we lost our imagination . "
