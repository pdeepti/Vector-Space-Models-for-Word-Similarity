moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...

he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 23.01.2010 crazy klopp 's boys restore pride to dortmund 's fanatical faithful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klopp is getting the most out of his squad a win over hamburg on saturday could catapult borussia dortmund to third in the bundesliga - as high up as they 've been this late in the season in seven years .
moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 23.01.2010 merkel calls for focus on improved training of afghan forces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants afghan forces to increasingly take responsibility for security chancellor angela merkel has stressed germany 's commitment to training afghan security forces .
meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...
they need to be able to join the peace process with dignity , " stanekzai said. rb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i choose to insist in defense of the integrity of the judicial system .
he needs to appear , " espinoza said .
" i 've made it clear he needs to surrender .
motion is denied . "
the oscar-winning film-maker 's lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing that they would appeal the decision .
under house arrest polanski , 76 , is under house arrest in switzerland , where he has been held since his detention in september on an international arrest warrant .
us prosecutors have been seeking his extradition since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during a 1977 photo shoot before having sex with her despite her protests .
the victim in the case , samantha geimer , now a 46-year-old mother of three , had supported polanski 's in absentia request , having previously urged that the case be dropped .
however , prosecutors last week filed a motion opposing any move to sentence the french-polish film-maker in absentia , arguing it would set a dangerous precedent .
" the defendant is a fugitive , " deputy district attorney david walgren wrote in court papers .
" the defendant should not , indeed must not , be allowed to dictate to this court or any other court , under what terms these proceedings should proceed .
mr. polanski must surrender . "
polanski , whose arrest last year triggered heated debate in european film industry , is known for the films " rosemary 's baby " and " chinatown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.01.2010 german left party leader steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard-left party gained influence under lafontaine 's leadership the leader of germany 's opposition left party , oskar lafontaine , says he is stepping down following a battle with prostate cancer .
he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision . " he is irreplaceable . " reacting to lafontaine 's announcement , current left party parliamentary group chairman gregor gysi said the left party in its current form would not exist without lafontaine , and that he " was , is and remains an outstanding figure " in german and european politics . " the party executive has no choice but to accept oskar lafontaine ’ s decision , even if it is extremely painful , " gysi said .

he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision .

immigration minister eric besson said france could not allow corsica to become yet another point of entry for illegal immigrants into europe .
" this event shows once again how it is of the utmost importance for the european union to strengthen surveillance along its borders , " he said .
" we can not let the mediterranean fall into the hands of human traffickers . "
besson added that eu immigration ministers should hold a crisis meeting to introduce " emergency measures to strengthen controls " along the mediterranean coast .
fifty-seven men , 29 women – five pregnant – and 38 children were dropped off by a boat near the southern town of bonifacio on friday , officials said .
the boat reportedly then took off , suggesting it was driven by traffickers .
french authorities say they are cooperating with italian coastguards to locate the boat drivers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident has prompted france to call for a european summit on immigration government response some of the migrants said they were kurds from syria while others said they were from middle eastern or north african countries .
authorities originally housed the group in a nearby gymnasium , but have since begun to transfer them to detention centers in mainland france .
the immigration ministry said they would assess each migrant 's case individually , and that each " will get an interpreter , a medical check-up , information on aid in case of voluntary return and legal help . "
the incident was the largest known mass-landing of immigrants on corsica .
such landings are not uncommon on italian islands further south , but it is unusual for illegal immigrants to enter europe through french territory. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 23.01.2010 eu applauds obama 's bank crackdown , but wo n't copy it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama said he 's ready for a fight major european economies have offered support for barack obama 's plan to limit banks ' size and trading activities but say have no plans to follow the us president 's example . obama 's dramatic proposals , announced on thursday and reiterated in speeches on friday , have the potential to alter the world financial order but experts criticized their lack of detail .
obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "

the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .

" i choose to insist in defense of the integrity of the judicial system .
he needs to appear , " espinoza said .
" i 've made it clear he needs to surrender .
motion is denied . "
the oscar-winning film-maker 's lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing that they would appeal the decision .
under house arrest polanski , 76 , is under house arrest in switzerland , where he has been held since his detention in september on an international arrest warrant .
us prosecutors have been seeking his extradition since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during a 1977 photo shoot before having sex with her despite her protests .
the victim in the case , samantha geimer , now a 46-year-old mother of three , had supported polanski 's in absentia request , having previously urged that the case be dropped .
however , prosecutors last week filed a motion opposing any move to sentence the french-polish film-maker in absentia , arguing it would set a dangerous precedent .
" the defendant is a fugitive , " deputy district attorney david walgren wrote in court papers .
" the defendant should not , indeed must not , be allowed to dictate to this court or any other court , under what terms these proceedings should proceed .
mr. polanski must surrender . "
polanski , whose arrest last year triggered heated debate in european film industry , is known for the films " rosemary 's baby " and " chinatown .

in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision . " he is irreplaceable . " reacting to lafontaine 's announcement , current left party parliamentary group chairman gregor gysi said the left party in its current form would not exist without lafontaine , and that he " was , is and remains an outstanding figure " in german and european politics . " the party executive has no choice but to accept oskar lafontaine ’ s decision , even if it is extremely painful , " gysi said .
" he is irreplaceable . " both gysi and lafontaine declined to name possible replacements for lafontaine 's position . lafontaine 's extraordinary political career began in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which he led for a time . he was spd premier of the german state of saarland , once ran unsuccessfully for chancellor , and was briefly german finance minister . the left party was formed in 2007 out of disgruntled spd members from western germany and former east german communists .

" i choose to insist in defense of the integrity of the judicial system .
he needs to appear , " espinoza said .
" i 've made it clear he needs to surrender .
motion is denied . "
the oscar-winning film-maker 's lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing that they would appeal the decision .
under house arrest polanski , 76 , is under house arrest in switzerland , where he has been held since his detention in september on an international arrest warrant .
us prosecutors have been seeking his extradition since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during a 1977 photo shoot before having sex with her despite her protests .
the victim in the case , samantha geimer , now a 46-year-old mother of three , had supported polanski 's in absentia request , having previously urged that the case be dropped .
however , prosecutors last week filed a motion opposing any move to sentence the french-polish film-maker in absentia , arguing it would set a dangerous precedent .
" the defendant is a fugitive , " deputy district attorney david walgren wrote in court papers .
" the defendant should not , indeed must not , be allowed to dictate to this court or any other court , under what terms these proceedings should proceed .
mr. polanski must surrender . "
polanski , whose arrest last year triggered heated debate in european film industry , is known for the films " rosemary 's baby " and " chinatown .

" i choose to insist in defense of the integrity of the judicial system .
he needs to appear , " espinoza said .
" i 've made it clear he needs to surrender .
motion is denied . "
the oscar-winning film-maker 's lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing that they would appeal the decision .
under house arrest polanski , 76 , is under house arrest in switzerland , where he has been held since his detention in september on an international arrest warrant .
us prosecutors have been seeking his extradition since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during a 1977 photo shoot before having sex with her despite her protests .
the victim in the case , samantha geimer , now a 46-year-old mother of three , had supported polanski 's in absentia request , having previously urged that the case be dropped .
however , prosecutors last week filed a motion opposing any move to sentence the french-polish film-maker in absentia , arguing it would set a dangerous precedent .

" the defendant should not , indeed must not , be allowed to dictate to this court or any other court , under what terms these proceedings should proceed .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

immigration minister eric besson said france could not allow corsica to become yet another point of entry for illegal immigrants into europe .

besson added that eu immigration ministers should hold a crisis meeting to introduce " emergency measures to strengthen controls " along the mediterranean coast .

" i choose to insist in defense of the integrity of the judicial system .
he needs to appear , " espinoza said .
" i 've made it clear he needs to surrender .
motion is denied . "
the oscar-winning film-maker 's lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing that they would appeal the decision .
under house arrest polanski , 76 , is under house arrest in switzerland , where he has been held since his detention in september on an international arrest warrant .
us prosecutors have been seeking his extradition since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during a 1977 photo shoot before having sex with her despite her protests .
the victim in the case , samantha geimer , now a 46-year-old mother of three , had supported polanski 's in absentia request , having previously urged that the case be dropped .
however , prosecutors last week filed a motion opposing any move to sentence the french-polish film-maker in absentia , arguing it would set a dangerous precedent .
" the defendant is a fugitive , " deputy district attorney david walgren wrote in court papers .
" the defendant should not , indeed must not , be allowed to dictate to this court or any other court , under what terms these proceedings should proceed .
mr. polanski must surrender . "
polanski , whose arrest last year triggered heated debate in european film industry , is known for the films " rosemary 's baby " and " chinatown .

immigration minister eric besson said france could not allow corsica to become yet another point of entry for illegal immigrants into europe .
" this event shows once again how it is of the utmost importance for the european union to strengthen surveillance along its borders , " he said .
" we can not let the mediterranean fall into the hands of human traffickers . "
besson added that eu immigration ministers should hold a crisis meeting to introduce " emergency measures to strengthen controls " along the mediterranean coast .
fifty-seven men , 29 women – five pregnant – and 38 children were dropped off by a boat near the southern town of bonifacio on friday , officials said .
the boat reportedly then took off , suggesting it was driven by traffickers .
french authorities say they are cooperating with italian coastguards to locate the boat drivers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident has prompted france to call for a european summit on immigration government response some of the migrants said they were kurds from syria while others said they were from middle eastern or north african countries .
authorities originally housed the group in a nearby gymnasium , but have since begun to transfer them to detention centers in mainland france .
the immigration ministry said they would assess each migrant 's case individually , and that each " will get an interpreter , a medical check-up , information on aid in case of voluntary return and legal help . "
the incident was the largest known mass-landing of immigrants on corsica .
such landings are not uncommon on italian islands further south , but it is unusual for illegal immigrants to enter europe through french territory. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision . " he is irreplaceable . " reacting to lafontaine 's announcement , current left party parliamentary group chairman gregor gysi said the left party in its current form would not exist without lafontaine , and that he " was , is and remains an outstanding figure " in german and european politics . " the party executive has no choice but to accept oskar lafontaine ’ s decision , even if it is extremely painful , " gysi said .
" he is irreplaceable . " both gysi and lafontaine declined to name possible replacements for lafontaine 's position . lafontaine 's extraordinary political career began in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which he led for a time . he was spd premier of the german state of saarland , once ran unsuccessfully for chancellor , and was briefly german finance minister . the left party was formed in 2007 out of disgruntled spd members from western germany and former east german communists .
at the last general election , the party won 12 percent of the vote . acb / rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i choose to insist in defense of the integrity of the judicial system .
he needs to appear , " espinoza said .
" i 've made it clear he needs to surrender .
motion is denied . "
the oscar-winning film-maker 's lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing that they would appeal the decision .
under house arrest polanski , 76 , is under house arrest in switzerland , where he has been held since his detention in september on an international arrest warrant .
us prosecutors have been seeking his extradition since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during a 1977 photo shoot before having sex with her despite her protests .
the victim in the case , samantha geimer , now a 46-year-old mother of three , had supported polanski 's in absentia request , having previously urged that the case be dropped .
however , prosecutors last week filed a motion opposing any move to sentence the french-polish film-maker in absentia , arguing it would set a dangerous precedent .
" the defendant is a fugitive , " deputy district attorney david walgren wrote in court papers .
" the defendant should not , indeed must not , be allowed to dictate to this court or any other court , under what terms these proceedings should proceed .
mr. polanski must surrender . "
polanski , whose arrest last year triggered heated debate in european film industry , is known for the films " rosemary 's baby " and " chinatown .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "

the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.01.2010 german left party leader steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard-left party gained influence under lafontaine 's leadership the leader of germany 's opposition left party , oskar lafontaine , says he is stepping down following a battle with prostate cancer .
he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .

" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

" i choose to insist in defense of the integrity of the judicial system .
he needs to appear , " espinoza said .
" i 've made it clear he needs to surrender .
motion is denied . "
the oscar-winning film-maker 's lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing that they would appeal the decision .
under house arrest polanski , 76 , is under house arrest in switzerland , where he has been held since his detention in september on an international arrest warrant .
us prosecutors have been seeking his extradition since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during a 1977 photo shoot before having sex with her despite her protests .
the victim in the case , samantha geimer , now a 46-year-old mother of three , had supported polanski 's in absentia request , having previously urged that the case be dropped .
however , prosecutors last week filed a motion opposing any move to sentence the french-polish film-maker in absentia , arguing it would set a dangerous precedent .
" the defendant is a fugitive , " deputy district attorney david walgren wrote in court papers .
" the defendant should not , indeed must not , be allowed to dictate to this court or any other court , under what terms these proceedings should proceed .
mr. polanski must surrender . "
polanski , whose arrest last year triggered heated debate in european film industry , is known for the films " rosemary 's baby " and " chinatown .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "

the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...

he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision . " he is irreplaceable . " reacting to lafontaine 's announcement , current left party parliamentary group chairman gregor gysi said the left party in its current form would not exist without lafontaine , and that he " was , is and remains an outstanding figure " in german and european politics . " the party executive has no choice but to accept oskar lafontaine ’ s decision , even if it is extremely painful , " gysi said .
" he is irreplaceable . " both gysi and lafontaine declined to name possible replacements for lafontaine 's position . lafontaine 's extraordinary political career began in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which he led for a time . he was spd premier of the german state of saarland , once ran unsuccessfully for chancellor , and was briefly german finance minister . the left party was formed in 2007 out of disgruntled spd members from western germany and former east german communists .

he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision .

" the party executive has no choice but to accept oskar lafontaine ’ s decision , even if it is extremely painful , " gysi said .
" he is irreplaceable .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

immigration minister eric besson said france could not allow corsica to become yet another point of entry for illegal immigrants into europe .
" this event shows once again how it is of the utmost importance for the european union to strengthen surveillance along its borders , " he said .
" we can not let the mediterranean fall into the hands of human traffickers . "
besson added that eu immigration ministers should hold a crisis meeting to introduce " emergency measures to strengthen controls " along the mediterranean coast .
fifty-seven men , 29 women – five pregnant – and 38 children were dropped off by a boat near the southern town of bonifacio on friday , officials said .
the boat reportedly then took off , suggesting it was driven by traffickers .
french authorities say they are cooperating with italian coastguards to locate the boat drivers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident has prompted france to call for a european summit on immigration government response some of the migrants said they were kurds from syria while others said they were from middle eastern or north african countries .
authorities originally housed the group in a nearby gymnasium , but have since begun to transfer them to detention centers in mainland france .
the immigration ministry said they would assess each migrant 's case individually , and that each " will get an interpreter , a medical check-up , information on aid in case of voluntary return and legal help . "
the incident was the largest known mass-landing of immigrants on corsica .
such landings are not uncommon on italian islands further south , but it is unusual for illegal immigrants to enter europe through french territory. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .
" he 's developing a solution to what he sees as the american issues , we 've already taken the necessary action in the uk , " myners said in a tv interview. bk / reuters / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 23.01.2010 crazy klopp 's boys restore pride to dortmund 's fanatical faithful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klopp is getting the most out of his squad a win over hamburg on saturday could catapult borussia dortmund to third in the bundesliga - as high up as they 've been this late in the season in seven years .
moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .

he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .

he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision . " he is irreplaceable . " reacting to lafontaine 's announcement , current left party parliamentary group chairman gregor gysi said the left party in its current form would not exist without lafontaine , and that he " was , is and remains an outstanding figure " in german and european politics . " the party executive has no choice but to accept oskar lafontaine ’ s decision , even if it is extremely painful , " gysi said .
" he is irreplaceable . " both gysi and lafontaine declined to name possible replacements for lafontaine 's position . lafontaine 's extraordinary political career began in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which he led for a time . he was spd premier of the german state of saarland , once ran unsuccessfully for chancellor , and was briefly german finance minister . the left party was formed in 2007 out of disgruntled spd members from western germany and former east german communists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 23.01.2010 crazy klopp 's boys restore pride to dortmund 's fanatical faithful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klopp is getting the most out of his squad a win over hamburg on saturday could catapult borussia dortmund to third in the bundesliga - as high up as they 've been this late in the season in seven years .
moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.01.2010 german left party leader steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard-left party gained influence under lafontaine 's leadership the leader of germany 's opposition left party , oskar lafontaine , says he is stepping down following a battle with prostate cancer .
he ’ s considered one of the most popular figures on the german left . german left party politician oskar lafontaine , 66 , announced at a press conference in berlin on saturday that he was giving up his parliamentary seat and his position as chairman of the party amid a battle with cancer . the announcement followed weeks of speculation over the issue .
in november 2009 , lafontaine underwent an operation for prostate cancer . " i am a political person , and this decision was not easy for me to make , " he said . lafontaine said he would officially step down after the left party convention in may .
he will also keep his position as the parliamentary group chairman in the state of saarland .
his departure from the top post could further inflame the current power struggle within the left party . last week , the party 's general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he would step down after being accused of disloyalty to lafontaine . lafontaine said bartsch ’ s stepping down played no role in his decision . " he is irreplaceable . " reacting to lafontaine 's announcement , current left party parliamentary group chairman gregor gysi said the left party in its current form would not exist without lafontaine , and that he " was , is and remains an outstanding figure " in german and european politics .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...

obama outlined a tough financial reform program that would limit the " excessive " risk-taking , blamed for the financial crisis , which drove the world 's biggest economy into its worst recession in decades .
global stocks plunged amid concerns about obama 's sweeping bank reform : the us stock market suffered a big selloff for the third consecutive day , while european shares dropped to post their worst weekly close in nearly three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's stock markets reacted badly to obama 's proposal eu unlikely to imitate an unnamed eu source told reuters news agency on friday that the european union will not imitate obama 's plan because it aims to reduce risk in the sector through other means .
" we understand the us position and we understand his reasons , but i ca n't see the eu going down this route , " the source , who is close to eu financial policymaking , said .
" the us finds itself a little behind us on this .
the obama plan is not fit for the purpose in the eu . "
the eu source said the 27-nation bloc would focus on raising banks ' capital requirements and tightening financial regulation , pursuing initiatives already under way in the european parliament .
" what is key to remember is that the us is one market , the eu is 27 markets and we are trying to encourage cross-border financial services and more importantly consolidation in both national and trans-national markets .
the obama plan would be anti-competitive in eu terms . " the source said most top banks in the world were american or had roots there , so it was understandable that obama wanted to curb their size . " the eu does not have so many ' too big to fail ' institutions , to be honest .
also , we have already started restructuring our banks , forcing them to downsize , sell off units and open up to newcomers . "
obama 's plan would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
it would also set a new limit on banks ' size in relation to the overall financial sector and could also bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , which are unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
proprietary trading involves firms making bets on markets with their own money and has been the source of much of banks ' bumper profits before and after the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians were enthusiastic europe reacts the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia called obama 's plan " very justified . "
" we all have the impression that financial entities in wall street have not yet learned all the lessons from the crisis , so i think the measures adopted by the us president are very justified , " almunia told an audience of spanish journalists in brussels . but almunia - who is to become competition commissioner in the next eu executive , and set to enter office on february 10 after a vote of confidence of the european parliament - explained that europe faces different challenges in regulating its financial sector .
french economics minister christine lagarde also welcomed the proposal , saying it was a " very , very good step forward , " while uk treasury minister paul myners said britain had already acted to address problems in its banking industry .

meanwhile , her development minister endorsed a plan to offer incentives for taliban fighters to give up arms . in her weekly video podcast on saturday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would concentrate its military efforts in northern afghanistan while accelerating the training of afghan security forces .
" so that rebuilding can take place , and so that the training of security forces can occur , it is necessary that the -lrb- afghan -rrb- population is protected from the taliban , " the chancellor said .
merkel has consistently rejected calls to make a military commitment ahead of a january 28 international conference in london on western strategy in afghanistan .
in her podcast , the chancellor also said that " formidable training efforts " were needed for the afghan forces , and that germany would pursue this in " a faster and more concentrated form than has been the case until now . "
" without peace there is no reconstruction , but without reconstruction there will be no peace either , " she added .
linking the increased civil reconstruction help to the gradual transfer of security duties to afghan forces , she said : " the people will feel , if responsibility is taken over step-by-step , that there is a better civilian reconstruction -lrb- effort -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops are stationed in the north of the country the comments come as speculation rages in germany about whether more soldiers will be sent to afghanistan , and less than a week before a key nato-led strategy conference in london . germany already has about 4,500 troops stationed in that country .
the podcast came a day after the opposition social democrats called for a definite withdrawal date of 2015 for the budeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , which was promptly rejected by the government .
support for taliban reintegration meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel told focus news magazine that germany could offer financial support for the move to offer material incentives to taliban fighters .
" i can imagine that the federal government will participate in such a fund , " niebel said .
it was important that a new “ perspective is offered to those fighters who are willing to renounce violence and abide by the afghan constitution , ” he added .
on friday , afghan president hamid karzai unveiled an ambitious western-funded plan to offer money and jobs to tempt taliban fighters to lay down their arms in an effort to quell a crippling insurgency .
his comments to the bbc came as us defence secretary robert gates described the taliban as part of afghanistan 's " political fabric , " but he added that any future role would depend on them laying down their weapons .
karzai is expected to present the plan - aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level taliban fighters - to donors at the conference in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes jobs and security will persuade the taliban to give up arms doubts over plan skeptics question the afghan government 's ability to draw tens of thousands of fighters from the hills by offering stipends , job training and education , as well as protection that has previously not been there .
the afghan official in charge of the program , mohammad masoom stanekzai , said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels after the london conference .
" this will be a broader , detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ...
they need to be able to join the peace process with dignity , " stanekzai said. rb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 23.01.2010 crazy klopp 's boys restore pride to dortmund 's fanatical faithful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klopp is getting the most out of his squad a win over hamburg on saturday could catapult borussia dortmund to third in the bundesliga - as high up as they 've been this late in the season in seven years .
moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .

moreover , they 're playing just the way their fans like it . a graph of the ruhr giants ' bundesliga exploits over the past few decades reads like a heart monitor ; a series of continuing highs and lows .
two seasons ago bvb -lrb- as the club is often called , from ballspiel-verein borussia -rrb- had nearly gone into arrest , experiencing one of its lowest ebbs for over 20 years .
a gradual decline from the 2002 title-winning season had seen the team slip down the standings each year , finishing the 2007-08 season in lowly 13th place .
after rallying to a sixth-placed finish last season , dortmund 's present perch in fifth as the second half of this season gets underway gives the faithful hope that stability and success could be on the horizon .
that , in itself , is a reason to be cheerful .
dortmund 's history is an uneven one , but that does n't stop the club from being one of the best-supported in germany .
dortmund are a massive club – not just because of their respectable trophy haul , but from their fanatical support , their ability to attract over 50,000 season ticket holders every year , and the ease with which they fill the 80,552-capacity signal iduna park at the drop of a yellow-and-black striped hat .
this level of support and loyalty is built on the history of a working-class community which profited together in the halcyon days of industrial production , but also struggled and strived together in its decline .
hard work and commitment on a par with glory as a result , dortmund fans do n't take anything for granted .
they know good times come and go and that you put in what you get out .
their six german championships in their 100-year history are seen as just rewards for the hard work of those seasons , not a birthright .
bildunterschrift : dortmund 's fans are a major force in the club 's fortunes this is why bvb fans do n't expect to win the league every year , but do expect their team to at least try .
if the players try their hardest and fail , then at least they can stand on the pitch and look the yellow wall of 24,500 faithful on the südtribüne terrace squarely in the eye with pride , without flinching .
that pride appears to be back in spades – on the pitch and in the stands .
the commitment and consistency the team has shown in the first half of the current season is their best run in more than seven years – dortmund are on an 11-game unbeaten streak , comprising eight wins and three draws .
stars playing for the team and the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp has turned nuri sahin 's promise into results at the moment , the team 's form is being driven by players who refuse to go missing when things get tough ; a problem that some dortmund teams of the past have experienced with their flair players .
more often than not , when bvb brought in a creative star in the past he turned out to be more show pony than workhorse .
nuri sahin is showing that his early promise was no flash in the pan by becoming a two-way midfield stalwart of the current team .
mats hummels is developing into an exciting attacking talent - from central defense .
nelson valdez is enjoying a busy season as a support forward , dispelling myths that he 's too lightweight and has a tendency to disappear from matches .
meanwhile , lucas barrios and mohamed zidan have given dortmund its most exciting attacking one-two punch since the days of jan koller and tomas rosicky .
these and other threads have been pulled together by coach juergen klopp , another member of the dortmund team who deserves credit for the present renaissance .
klopp : bvb 's jekyll and hyde coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's coach has endeared himself to the fans it might seem strange that a man like klopp has managed to harness the traditional working man 's values of the club – and the communitarian ethic which runs through the city itself – to give the fans a team to be proud of .
somehow though , it works .
at first glance , klopp is all wrong for dortmund .
with his trendy glasses and stubble beard , the stuttgart-born coach has a slightly professorial air about him and lacks the plainspoken earthiness attributed to those from germany 's former industrial heartland .
in his role as a tv soccer pundit , he showed a well-spoken and analytic side to his personality , combined with a genial nature and a penchant for sharp suits .
hardly a typical dortmund football man .
and yet , klopp embodies much of what bvb fans demand from their team and coach .
on match days , he has boundless energy , unbridled passion and huge belief in his team and himself .
however , his self-control leaves much to be desired – a personality trait that both endears him to the bvb faithful and irks them in equal measure -lrb- how can the coach get the best out of team when he 's banished to the stands ? -rrb- .
he is , on the other hand , the first manager to deliver silverware , however paltry – the dfb supercup in 2008 – to the club in almost eight years . klopp 's outbursts , in the hope he can bring further glory , are mostly tolerated .
return of attacking flair excites traditionalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucas barrios and bvb are far from goal shy apart from the commitment klopp demands , the longtime mainz player and coach has brought back one of dortmund 's most traditional playing attributes – the cavalier attack .
bvb fans have always been happiest when their team has been overtly offensive , even allowing them their defensive frailties if they fostered exciting attacking displays .
klopp has resurrected this approach .
last season , his first in the dortmund hot seat , bvb scored 60 goals and had a goal difference of plus 23 .
so far this season , his charges have hit 26 with a goal difference of plus seven .
just as with some of his mainz teams of the past , klopp appears to have adopted the mentality that " it 's alright to concede goals , as long we score more . "
it 's a recipe for exciting but unpredictable soccer – a staple of any good dortmunder 's football diet .
however , until last week 's 3-2 win at cologne , dortmund had not conceded more than one goal in any of their previous 12 matches , a statistic that klopp has also begun to understand that having too porous a defense will eventually undo all the good offensive work .
the current bvb side 's devil-may-care approach is unlikely to bring the league title to dortmund this season , but dortmund fans now have what they 've always demanded from their club – a team that plays with passion and tries its best .
anything else is a bonus .
