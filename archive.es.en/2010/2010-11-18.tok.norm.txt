last night about 2.5 million pilgrims spent their night here in tents .
the symbolic stoning of the devil ends today – and so does the hajj .
i look at the kaaba one more time and almost feel a bit sad .
today , pilgrims will circle the kaaba seven times - and then it 's all over .
however , i 'll stay a little longer .
i will visit the city of jiddah and tell you about my experiences there . looking at the kaaba , a question by dw user " serubogo " comes to my mind .
he wondered whether islamic tradition says that heaven 's gate is located above the kaaba – and whether there 's even a non-fly zone around mecca for that reason . well , i 've never heard anything about that .
i asked some of the pilgrims , and they had n't heard about it either .
so i guess it 's another example of the fact that religious teachings and local or regional customs merge from time to time – in islam as well as in other religions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female pilgrims get a ride to the next stage of the hajj but even if there was a no-fly zone here , then it definitely does n't apply to helicopters !
because one can see them hovering above around the clock here , monitoring the pilgrimage and supporting the police and paramedics . still , as in previous years some pilgrims died during the hajj , but the numbers were apparently lower than earlier .
until now the authorities either could n't or didn ’ t want to give me any concrete figures . but apparently most of the deaths were related to traffic accidents .
unlike earlier , there were no mass panics as the security measures were improved significantly .
dw user nasyr muhammad is probably not the only one who was interested in this piece of information . susan 's dangerous assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taken from a helicopter - unfortunately not from susan susan baaghil has a vivid recollection of the events of 1997 when hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the chaos of that year ’ s hajj .
susan is considered saudi arabia ’ s first female press photographer .
she documented the catastrophe aboard a helicopter with its doors open .
" these assignments are dangerous , " she says .
" but being a photographer is my calling . " like me , susan , who is fluent in four languages , originally hails from yemen .
there are n't all that many female photographers in saudi arabia , but she says she feels accepted by her male colleagues .
by the way , she 's not only working for the reuters news agency – but also as a wedding photographer .
" the first thing i saw after i was born was n't my mother , but her camera ” , she says with a smile . poor and rich pilgrims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim pilgrims pray on the side of a street as a press photographer , susan has very high standards .
she does n't want to snap only the usual pictures of the huge crowds of pilgrims one often gets from the event .
instead she also wants to cover the places the saudi authorities are less keen for the world to see : like the tent cities of " illegal " pilgrims who came here without a visa or an official permit . most of them are poor people from saudi arabia and other countries who simply ca n't afford the costs of the hajj .
" my pictures are supposed to reveal how difficult it is for these people , " explains susan .
" my goal is that people feel for these poor pilgrims and perhaps help them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims stoning the devil at jamarat bridge in these tent cities the garbage is piling up : plastic bags , empty boxes , left over food that is left to rot - the stench is at times so bad that some pilgrims only walk around with their masks on .
there are simply far too few trash cans and many people are afraid of the spread of diseases . at the same time , there are quite a number of very affluent pilgrims .
i met a man who was given 7,000 euros from his mother to make sure he would have a comfortable hajj and could spend his nights in a luxury hotel .
that leads me to the question of dw user hayman said who asked how pilgrims spend their money during the hajj .
well , i don ’ t know how it is all spent in detail .
but i would guess that the hotels here are probably doing really well . consulting a doctor is free by the way , i am also living in a hotel here .
it 's a room with eight beds which i share it with pilgrims form lebanon , syria , and yemen .
last night we were really cold , because we had turned the air conditioner down too low – our own fault .
so today , i feel like a caught a little cold .
and my knee hurts too , so i ’ ll go see the pilgrimage physician . while i really miss germany , i like the fact that going to the hospital is free and totally unbureaucratic here .
i see a saudi physician called muhammad ali khalifa who studied in austria twenty years ago and still raves about the country and the people .
in a friendly tone , he reprimands me for having missed some vaccinations .
" is that a problem ? "
i ask him , a bit worried .
" no , " he replies .
" that ’ s okay .
there 's no danger of swine flu or meningitis during the hajj season . " thank god ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet : the eurozone is in great need of governance speaking at a central banking conference in frankfurt , jean-claude trichet bemoaned the weakening of the stability and growth pact - which seeks to limit the budget deficits of eu member states to 3 percent of gdp - and called for " quantum leap " in economic governance in an " exceptionally demanding and uncertain " environment .
as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 18.11.2010 nokia siemens lawsuit dropped by iranian plaintiffs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians accused nokia siemens of helping the regime two iranian plaintiffs had filed a case against nokia siemens in american federal court , where they had alleged that the sale of telecommunications surveillance technology to iran had resulted in arrest and torture . last wednesday , the attorney for two iranians who had sued nokia siemens networks in an american federal court withdrew their lawsuit .
in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia siemens networks has said that it is no longer involved in iran nokia siemens networks denies responsibility in response to the withdrawl , the company posted a statement to its website that the company " can not and should not be held responsible for the alleged actions of the iranian authorities . "
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .

"
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

last night about 2.5 million pilgrims spent their night here in tents .
the symbolic stoning of the devil ends today – and so does the hajj .
i look at the kaaba one more time and almost feel a bit sad .
today , pilgrims will circle the kaaba seven times - and then it 's all over .
however , i 'll stay a little longer .
i will visit the city of jiddah and tell you about my experiences there . looking at the kaaba , a question by dw user " serubogo " comes to my mind .
he wondered whether islamic tradition says that heaven 's gate is located above the kaaba – and whether there 's even a non-fly zone around mecca for that reason . well , i 've never heard anything about that .
i asked some of the pilgrims , and they had n't heard about it either .
so i guess it 's another example of the fact that religious teachings and local or regional customs merge from time to time – in islam as well as in other religions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female pilgrims get a ride to the next stage of the hajj but even if there was a no-fly zone here , then it definitely does n't apply to helicopters !
because one can see them hovering above around the clock here , monitoring the pilgrimage and supporting the police and paramedics . still , as in previous years some pilgrims died during the hajj , but the numbers were apparently lower than earlier .
until now the authorities either could n't or didn ’ t want to give me any concrete figures . but apparently most of the deaths were related to traffic accidents .
unlike earlier , there were no mass panics as the security measures were improved significantly .
dw user nasyr muhammad is probably not the only one who was interested in this piece of information . susan 's dangerous assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taken from a helicopter - unfortunately not from susan susan baaghil has a vivid recollection of the events of 1997 when hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the chaos of that year ’ s hajj .
susan is considered saudi arabia ’ s first female press photographer .
she documented the catastrophe aboard a helicopter with its doors open .
" these assignments are dangerous , " she says .
" but being a photographer is my calling . " like me , susan , who is fluent in four languages , originally hails from yemen .
there are n't all that many female photographers in saudi arabia , but she says she feels accepted by her male colleagues .
by the way , she 's not only working for the reuters news agency – but also as a wedding photographer .
" the first thing i saw after i was born was n't my mother , but her camera ” , she says with a smile . poor and rich pilgrims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim pilgrims pray on the side of a street as a press photographer , susan has very high standards .
she does n't want to snap only the usual pictures of the huge crowds of pilgrims one often gets from the event .
instead she also wants to cover the places the saudi authorities are less keen for the world to see : like the tent cities of " illegal " pilgrims who came here without a visa or an official permit . most of them are poor people from saudi arabia and other countries who simply ca n't afford the costs of the hajj .
" my pictures are supposed to reveal how difficult it is for these people , " explains susan .
" my goal is that people feel for these poor pilgrims and perhaps help them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims stoning the devil at jamarat bridge in these tent cities the garbage is piling up : plastic bags , empty boxes , left over food that is left to rot - the stench is at times so bad that some pilgrims only walk around with their masks on .
there are simply far too few trash cans and many people are afraid of the spread of diseases . at the same time , there are quite a number of very affluent pilgrims .
i met a man who was given 7,000 euros from his mother to make sure he would have a comfortable hajj and could spend his nights in a luxury hotel .
that leads me to the question of dw user hayman said who asked how pilgrims spend their money during the hajj .
well , i don ’ t know how it is all spent in detail .
but i would guess that the hotels here are probably doing really well . consulting a doctor is free by the way , i am also living in a hotel here .
it 's a room with eight beds which i share it with pilgrims form lebanon , syria , and yemen .
last night we were really cold , because we had turned the air conditioner down too low – our own fault .
so today , i feel like a caught a little cold .
and my knee hurts too , so i ’ ll go see the pilgrimage physician . while i really miss germany , i like the fact that going to the hospital is free and totally unbureaucratic here .
i see a saudi physician called muhammad ali khalifa who studied in austria twenty years ago and still raves about the country and the people .
in a friendly tone , he reprimands me for having missed some vaccinations .
" is that a problem ? "
i ask him , a bit worried .
" no , " he replies .
" that ’ s okay .
there 's no danger of swine flu or meningitis during the hajj season . " thank god ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .

nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 18.11.2010 google launches street view across 20 german cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google navigated a web of privacy concerns in germany to publish its photos following much controversy , highly detailed street-level photographs are now available in berlin , cologne , hannover and beyond .
but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

the defendant faces 20 years in jail , but some say the case is a failure . a civilian jury has acquitted a former guantanamo bay inmate on multiple terror charges , but convicted him for plotting to bomb the us embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 .
among other charges , the defendant was cleared of 276 counts of attempted murder , due in part to key evidence being deemed inadmissible by the court .
" we respect the jury 's verdict and are pleased that ahmed ghailani now faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a potential life sentence for his role in the embassy bombings , " a spokesman for the us justice department said after the trial .
critics of president barack obama 's policy of trying guantanamo bay detainees in civilian courts , rather than by military tribunal , say the trial has highlighted the flaws in this strategy .
" we are at war with al qaeda , " republican senator lindsey graham said after the verdict was announced .
" members of the organization , and their associates , should be treated as warriors , not common criminals .
we put our nation at risk by criminalizing the war . "
ahmed ghailani 's case had been chosen for civilian trial , in part , because it was deemed one where a conviction was considered particularly probable .
a further 174 terror suspects are being held at the military detention center in guantanamo bay , awaiting trial .
" going forward , i once again strongly encourage the obama administration to use military commissions to prosecute enemy combatants , particularly the 9/11 conspirators like khalid sheikh mohammed , held at guantanamo bay , cuba , " senator graham said .
entrenched stances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil trials can be complicated after defendants have been denied rights arguably the biggest setback for the prosecution was an initial ruling from the judge , lewis kaplan , not to admit testimony from the government 's star witness , who had been expected to say he sold ghailani explosives .
kaplan said hussein abebe could not take to the stand because he had been identified through information obtained from ghailani while under extreme duress in cia custody .
" the civil court also indicated that the statements which could have led to a tougher sentence probably would n't have been accepted by a military tribunal either , " a professor in political and american sciences at the university of jena , michael dreyer , told deutsche welle .
" that 's because the evidence was obtained , in part , by way of torture - or rather by what is sometimes called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' in the us , but is generally called ' torture ' in the rest of the world . "
dreyer said that the issue has become more about politics than legal issues , pointing to supreme court rulings saying that guantanamo detainees should still have the right to a civilian trial under us law .
he believes that the us opposition primarily sees the issue as a way to undermine obama 's policies on dealing with terror suspects .
" i think the battle lines are so clearly drawn now that genuine factors are hardly going to change anybody 's mind .
people have already formed their opinions , and are likely to stick to them . "
during the trial , prosecutors sought to portray the defendant as a co-conspirator who helped an al qaeda bomber prepare the truck bombs which slammed almost simultaneously into the us embassies in kenya and tanzania , killing 224 people and injuring thousands more .
ghailani 's defense attorney , peter quijano , called no witnesses of his own , but cross-examined state witnesses vigorously , and described his client as an innocent dupe , who was used by al qaeda , but knew little or nothing of their intentions .
" at the start of this trial , we believed that ahmed was truly innocent of all of these charges .
please understand that we still truly believe he is innocent of all of these charges , " quijano told reporters outside the court .
domestic dissatisfaction , international support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghailani was part of the bomb attacks on the us embassies in kenya and tanzania human rights group amnesty international , which has vehemently opposed the detainment center at guantanamo bay since its inception , praised the trial , and called on the us to ensure all future cases are tried in civilian courts .
" us politicians who are opposed to trials in federal courts for guantanamo detainees have chosen to ignore the conviction and are arguing that ahmed ghailani 's acquittal on the other charges demonstrates that civilian criminal trials are inappropriate , " amnesty 's bob freer said .
" if the only procedure that critics of ordinary criminal trials would accept is one that guarantees convictions regardless of evidence , then what has been demonstrated is a gross failure on their part to commit to the most basic principles of fairness . "
speaking to deutsche welle , relatives of some of the victims of the 1998 attacks in which ghailani played a part admitted they had hoped for a more clear-cut verdict .
" we accepted the verdict as it is , even if we have been affected , because we can do nothing - although we are not happy with the decision , " shaaban said mtullya , whose wife was killed in the blasts , said .
" you can be affected in such a way that no compensation can be paid for it .
and even if the attacker will be sentenced to death , that will change nothing .
so what you can do is to forgive and move forward with your life , " said okia omtata , who lost his nephew .
" we will seek the maximum sentence of life without parole when -lrb- ghailani -rrb- is sentenced in january , " us prosecuting attorney preet bharara said after the trial in new york .

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet : the eurozone is in great need of governance speaking at a central banking conference in frankfurt , jean-claude trichet bemoaned the weakening of the stability and growth pact - which seeks to limit the budget deficits of eu member states to 3 percent of gdp - and called for " quantum leap " in economic governance in an " exceptionally demanding and uncertain " environment .
as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 18.11.2010 european airlines flout passenger rights , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are being denied their rights a new report from germany 's consumer protection body says that european airlines are flouting eu regulations on ‘ passenger rights . '
this is unsurprising , considering the cut-throat price war in the air travel market . it may be the first time that air-rage has manifested itself as a communal sit-in .
a tense stand-off ensued tuesday night when around 90 passengers returning from morocco to paris refused to disembark from a ryanair flight that had landed three hours late – at liege airport in belgium .
there was a good explanation for the detour – fog had made a safe landing impossible at beauvais airport north of paris – but for over four hours passengers refused to travel the last 350 kilometers -lrb- 225 miles -rrb- on the buses provided by ryanair .
reports said the crew reacted by turning off the lights , locking the toilets and leaving the aircraft , but ryanair denied that version of events , whicle a spokesman for liege airport described the atmosphere as " really tense " and referred to " a few acts of violence " by the passengers .
whether this exceptionally angry protest was justified is open to question , but it marks a new low in relations between airlines and passengers .
coincidentally , it also comes in the same week that the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- released a damning survey of german customer satisfaction in the airline industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprisingly , there were fewer complaints about budget airlines the key conclusion of the survey was that the ' airline passenger rights ' introduced by the european union five years ago are often being ignored .
flouting the new rules the eu directive was designed to guarantee airline passengers compensation for cancelled or delayed flights , but many national governments have yet to devise the institutions that enforce these rules .
the vzbv 's survey - comprising 1,122 questionnaires - found that 80 percent of people were only informed of flight delays at the airport .
the report also said that only 25 percent were offered compensation or other services stipulated by the regulations , and then almost always only after having demanded it .
over half of those surveyed also said that they were not made aware of their passenger rights before their journey – another one of the eu 's stipulations .
according to vzbv lawyer sabine fischer-volk , it was n't just the budget airlines that failed to provide the service .
" more or less all airlines have been ignoring the passengers ' rights , " she told deutsche welle .
" we got the most complaints about lufthansa , condor , and air berlin – the high-end airlines . "
the survey should not be taken as a ratings table for airlines themselves , since those questioned flew mainly with airlines that operate in germany .
but the vzbv say their data shows a significant flouting of the rules by the airline industry in general .
good reasons apart from the problem of inadequate enforcement , fischer-volk pointed out the obvious economic reasons for the airline 's policy .
unlike the compensation offered by german rail operator deutsche bahn , for example , the eu-stipulated compensation is not tied to the cost of the flight tickets , but by the distance of the journey , and it is always between 250 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 338 - $ 810 -rrb- per passenger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister is in the middle of setting up a new arbitration committee " if you calculate that for a fully-booked airplane , that comes to roughly four times the cost of the flight , " said fischer-volk .
" and of course the airlines are going to do all they can to avoid paying that . "
the compensation payments are the same for budget airlines and high-end airlines , but since the high-end airlines have been losing passengers to the budget airlines , they are under considerable pressure to protect their profit margins .
arbitration committee in the works the vzbv also reported that airlines often systematically deprived passengers of their rights by delaying letters , while fines imposed by german authorities like the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- were not intimidating enough .
in an interview with financial daily handelsblatt , the chairman of the berlin branch of the vzbv , juergen kessler , said that by its nature the lba " is closer to the industry than it is to the consumers . "
this is a key reason why a new arbitration committee is needed .
" the lba is not an arbitrative body in the sense the eu requires , but a managing body that imposes fines , but does not make rulings , " said fischer-volk .
" that means that the only recourse for passengers not compensated by airlines is a civil court .
that is of course very cumbersome and very expensive , and it clogs courts with thousands of cases . "
the german government is currently in the process of setting up a new independent body , and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger recently told the tagesspiegel newspaper that " constructive " negotiations for were in progress .
" that would be a decisive step towards a proper arbitration committee , " said fischer-volk .
" of course the final step would be that if there was a legitimate claim the airlines would regulate themselves .
then we would n't need the committee . "

last night about 2.5 million pilgrims spent their night here in tents .
the symbolic stoning of the devil ends today – and so does the hajj .
i look at the kaaba one more time and almost feel a bit sad .
today , pilgrims will circle the kaaba seven times - and then it 's all over .
however , i 'll stay a little longer .
i will visit the city of jiddah and tell you about my experiences there . looking at the kaaba , a question by dw user " serubogo " comes to my mind .
he wondered whether islamic tradition says that heaven 's gate is located above the kaaba – and whether there 's even a non-fly zone around mecca for that reason . well , i 've never heard anything about that .
i asked some of the pilgrims , and they had n't heard about it either .
so i guess it 's another example of the fact that religious teachings and local or regional customs merge from time to time – in islam as well as in other religions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female pilgrims get a ride to the next stage of the hajj but even if there was a no-fly zone here , then it definitely does n't apply to helicopters !
because one can see them hovering above around the clock here , monitoring the pilgrimage and supporting the police and paramedics . still , as in previous years some pilgrims died during the hajj , but the numbers were apparently lower than earlier .
until now the authorities either could n't or didn ’ t want to give me any concrete figures . but apparently most of the deaths were related to traffic accidents .
unlike earlier , there were no mass panics as the security measures were improved significantly .
dw user nasyr muhammad is probably not the only one who was interested in this piece of information . susan 's dangerous assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taken from a helicopter - unfortunately not from susan susan baaghil has a vivid recollection of the events of 1997 when hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the chaos of that year ’ s hajj .
susan is considered saudi arabia ’ s first female press photographer .
she documented the catastrophe aboard a helicopter with its doors open .
" these assignments are dangerous , " she says .
" but being a photographer is my calling . " like me , susan , who is fluent in four languages , originally hails from yemen .
there are n't all that many female photographers in saudi arabia , but she says she feels accepted by her male colleagues .
by the way , she 's not only working for the reuters news agency – but also as a wedding photographer .
" the first thing i saw after i was born was n't my mother , but her camera ” , she says with a smile . poor and rich pilgrims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim pilgrims pray on the side of a street as a press photographer , susan has very high standards .
she does n't want to snap only the usual pictures of the huge crowds of pilgrims one often gets from the event .
instead she also wants to cover the places the saudi authorities are less keen for the world to see : like the tent cities of " illegal " pilgrims who came here without a visa or an official permit . most of them are poor people from saudi arabia and other countries who simply ca n't afford the costs of the hajj .
" my pictures are supposed to reveal how difficult it is for these people , " explains susan .
" my goal is that people feel for these poor pilgrims and perhaps help them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims stoning the devil at jamarat bridge in these tent cities the garbage is piling up : plastic bags , empty boxes , left over food that is left to rot - the stench is at times so bad that some pilgrims only walk around with their masks on .
there are simply far too few trash cans and many people are afraid of the spread of diseases . at the same time , there are quite a number of very affluent pilgrims .
i met a man who was given 7,000 euros from his mother to make sure he would have a comfortable hajj and could spend his nights in a luxury hotel .
that leads me to the question of dw user hayman said who asked how pilgrims spend their money during the hajj .
well , i don ’ t know how it is all spent in detail .
but i would guess that the hotels here are probably doing really well . consulting a doctor is free by the way , i am also living in a hotel here .
it 's a room with eight beds which i share it with pilgrims form lebanon , syria , and yemen .
last night we were really cold , because we had turned the air conditioner down too low – our own fault .
so today , i feel like a caught a little cold .
and my knee hurts too , so i ’ ll go see the pilgrimage physician . while i really miss germany , i like the fact that going to the hospital is free and totally unbureaucratic here .
i see a saudi physician called muhammad ali khalifa who studied in austria twenty years ago and still raves about the country and the people .
in a friendly tone , he reprimands me for having missed some vaccinations .
" is that a problem ? "
i ask him , a bit worried .
" no , " he replies .
" that ’ s okay .
there 's no danger of swine flu or meningitis during the hajj season . " thank god ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2010 opinion : ' the minister could not have left people in the dark ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grave warning by the german government that a terrorist attack might be imminent has unsettled many people .
but deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle is convinced it was the right decision to make the announcement . how will people react to the news ?
interior minister thomas de maiziere is n't usually one to propagate fear in order to prepare the ground for tougher security laws , which is why germans find his terror warning particularly disturbing .
will germans avoid soccer stadiums at the weekend ?
will they cancel planned trips or take the car instead of the plane or train in order to evade danger ?
in theory , everyone knows that the risk of dying in a car crash is bigger than falling victim to a terrorist attack .
but driving a car , people still have the feeling that they can control their fate to a certain degree .
at the airport , the train station or in a soccer stadium , however , people feel they are vulnerable , at the mercy of the evil intentions of lurking religious fanatics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the interior minister not have warned the public ?
or should he have left it at his much less concrete appeal two weeks ago , when he said citizens should keep their eyes peeled and inform the police of suspicious goings-on ?
without knowing what de maiziere knows , we can presume that he would have done just that if it had been justifiable .
the indications must be so concrete that he could not leave people in the dark about the dangers .
of course , people noticed the increased police presence at vulnerable sites on wednesday  it was up to the minister to give an explanation .
otherwise , the population might have felt even more intimidated .
criticism voiced by the leader of the opposition greens , juergen trittin , that the interior minister should be more specific , is narrow-minded . he probably ca n't be more specific without endangering the sources for his information .
the public  s safety relies on these sources .
after all , it is thanks to their information channels that intelligence services repeatedly managed to avert planned terrorist attacks over the past few years .
there is reason for optimism that they will succeed again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .

the government should do more to support cultural education at a young age , he says . deutsche welle : mr hoffmann , do you think there are enough museums , community cinemas and other similar cultural institutions in germany , or is there room for improvement ? hilmar hoffmann : there is definitely room for improvement .
it 's always only the big cities which have an extensive collection of museums - like berlin , hamburg , munich , stuttgart or frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar hoffmann would like to see culture mentioned in the german constitution but think about the people in the countryside , which is a large majority of the population .
they did n't grow up with equal opportunity because they never had the chance to take advantage of cultural institutions . " culture for everyone " was your maxim during your time as head of the goethe-institut .
now that you are retired , how do you view the slogan " culture for everyone " in light of your current reality ? statistically speaking , culture for everyone is still a work in progress .
i would say that more than 15 percent of the population does not regularly participate in cultural events .
that 's why it 's important for schools to make aesthetic development and musical training part of their curriculum , so that every young person has the opportunity to grow up with equal opportunities and become a participant in the cultural offerings that they are paying for with their tax money . where do you see the biggest deficits ?
is it the schools that do n't see it as a priority , or is there just not enough money from the state ? i would say , the deficit can be found in politics , which has failed to bring about the necessary changes in the school curriculum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultural development should start young , says hoffmann here in the state of hesse , for example , we had a culture commission with great partners , and , in our concluding report , we stated that the ministry of culture and the ministry of education finally had to start working together to start providing cultural education in schools .
and that 's true not just for hesse but for all the states .
and as long as those are competing ministries - competing as far as funding goes - things wo n't change . you mentioned politics .
there has also been an ongoing discussion about making culture national policy - something which you have advocated .
why is that ? because all kinds of special interests are secured in the constitution .
sport , for example , is considered a basic right .
why not culture ?
on the other hand , it is stated in the constitution that we are a kulturstaat -lrb- cultural state -rrb- .
that 's why it is the state 's job to ensure the opportunity for cultural development from the very beginning of our individuation - that is , in pre-school . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government should do more to support cultural education at a young age , he says . deutsche welle : mr hoffmann , do you think there are enough museums , community cinemas and other similar cultural institutions in germany , or is there room for improvement ? hilmar hoffmann : there is definitely room for improvement .
it 's always only the big cities which have an extensive collection of museums - like berlin , hamburg , munich , stuttgart or frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar hoffmann would like to see culture mentioned in the german constitution but think about the people in the countryside , which is a large majority of the population .
they did n't grow up with equal opportunity because they never had the chance to take advantage of cultural institutions . " culture for everyone " was your maxim during your time as head of the goethe-institut .
now that you are retired , how do you view the slogan " culture for everyone " in light of your current reality ? statistically speaking , culture for everyone is still a work in progress .
i would say that more than 15 percent of the population does not regularly participate in cultural events .
that 's why it 's important for schools to make aesthetic development and musical training part of their curriculum , so that every young person has the opportunity to grow up with equal opportunities and become a participant in the cultural offerings that they are paying for with their tax money . where do you see the biggest deficits ?
is it the schools that do n't see it as a priority , or is there just not enough money from the state ? i would say , the deficit can be found in politics , which has failed to bring about the necessary changes in the school curriculum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultural development should start young , says hoffmann here in the state of hesse , for example , we had a culture commission with great partners , and , in our concluding report , we stated that the ministry of culture and the ministry of education finally had to start working together to start providing cultural education in schools .
and that 's true not just for hesse but for all the states .
and as long as those are competing ministries - competing as far as funding goes - things wo n't change . you mentioned politics .
there has also been an ongoing discussion about making culture national policy - something which you have advocated .
why is that ? because all kinds of special interests are secured in the constitution .
sport , for example , is considered a basic right .
why not culture ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 18.11.2010 msf wants eu 's ' hands off ' life-saving generic drugs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed trade deal could spell death for many of india 's generic drug customers as the european union and india try to reach a free-trade agreement , the humanitarian group doctors without borders is concerned .
it 's afraid the deal could limit access to affordable generic drugs it relies on . the humanitarian organization doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- sources 80 percent of the anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- it uses to treat hiv / aids in the developing world from india .
india has become known as " the pharmacy of the developing world " for producing affordable , generic drugs .
but some activists warn that a proposed free-trade agreement between the european union and india could lead to tougher intellectual property regulations that could hamper access to cheap , generic indian medicines .
msf recently launched the ' europe !
hands off our medicine ' campaign to pressure the 27-member bloc into halting measures it says would substantially restrict access to inexpensive medicines for people in developing countries .
last week , in an open letter to european trade commissioner karel de gucht , msf warned that if the european commission pursues the trade deal " people who rely on these medicines to stay alive will be left without a lifeline and many are likely to die . "
deutsche welle talked to msf 's international president , dr. unni karunakara , about the campaign , as eu-india negotiations on the proposed free-trade agreement progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. unni karunakara heads doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- and opposes the trade deal deutsche welle : msf has accused the eu of trying to " shut off the tap of affordable medicines . "
why is india so important in the context of generic drugs globally ?
dr. unni karunakara : we have 160,000 hiv / aids patients now on treatment in africa alone , and 80 percent of the drugs that we use to treat our patients come from india .
so india is for us the pharmacy of the world .
this is where the drugs come from that allow us to treat so many patients .
it is very important that this space exists in india for us to be able to continue to produce generic medications and our ability to actually use them as well .
the other concern is that increasingly the industry and other governments are characterizing generic drugs as counterfeit drugs .
that 's absolutely not the case .
generic drugs work as well as branded drugs , it 's just that they are not made by a company .
characterising generic drugs as fake , counterfeit or substandard is actually doing a disservice , and it 's going to affect our ability to treat patients in africa big time .
and that 's why we are concerned , and that 's why we have launched this campaign .
the campaign slogan leaves little doubt that you 're suggesting interference by europe in the production and distribution of various life-saving drugs .
but can msf and others push their argument forward using a rights perspective ?
i think the big victory in the doha rounds was that intellectual property rights are in opposition to large public health concerns ; the government has the right to overturn the pattern .
i think we need to keep that ; we ca n't afford to lose that .
what governments are trying to do is to enter into bilateral agreements to undermine this sort of international agreement -lsb- doha declaration -rsb- and , by underhand methods , trying to again shut down the production of generics .
for us this is a huge problem .
europe and other western governments are trying to bind india to a deal that will hit the production of generics and you say deprive millions of patients of affordable drugs .
how can countries that are often seen as benign donors justify this ?
i think it 's a question of " does the right hand know what the left hand is doing . "
i think there are different parts of the government or different parts of the european union that are engaged in negotiations .
the european commission humanitarian aid and civil protection , as we know , is trying to promote humanitarian action , has a large amount of funding for humanitarian work that is going on .
at the same time , the trade and commerce people are , of course , interested in protecting their interests , whether it 's in europe or in america .
i think sometimes these things come in to competition , and we are relying on the good will of the public to tell their politicians what matters most .
we 've had great successes in the past , and we hope that this campaign will also help get our concerns heard , and that the citizens will also express their opinion on this matter , and force their governments to back down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. karunakara urges india to realize the impact of its drug industry on global health based on developments so far , is it realistic to expect that the two sides can modify the proposed eu-india free-trade agreement enough to dispel your concerns ?
we always put the pressure on the european governments ; i think the indian government also needs to live up to its role as an aspiring superpower .
i do n't think many people in india fully realize the impact of the indian drug industry on the lives of people outside india .
and i think this is something they need to know .
they need to know that they are serving a larger purpose .
the government needs to take a firm stand and it can do it .
i 'm personally hopeful that the negotiations will go in the right direction .
i think india should step up to addressing this problem and consider the lives of so many - 4 million people on treatment in africa alone - and that is not just msf but all patients , and many of them rely on indian drugs .
msf also claims that the european commission is attacking not only the production of generic medicines , but also their registration , transportation and export .
as far as i understand , any drug that passes through a european port , the consignment can be confiscated and even destroyed .
so that 's also a very important part of the problem .
we want the eu to not enforce this very arbitrary kind of decision that they have made .
msf has said the eu-india deal is only a fraction of the attacks on the generic medicine industry .
where else are the obstacles being placed and what kind of an impact are they going to have ?
the us and the pharmaceutical industry are right now in india , challenging patents that are being granted by the indian government or trying to gain patents for certain drugs which the indian government has deemed not worthy of patent .
the efforts are going on in many different forums , so i think this is a multi-pronged attack from the industry and governments to address this issue once and for all .
and we just ca n't let that happen .
apart from the hiv / aids medicines you are distributing , what other diseases and health conditions are we talking about when we refer to generics from india ?
as far as other diseases are concerned , a lot of those we treat - neglected tropical diseases like sleeping sickness -lsb- which is endemic to sub-saharan africa -rsb- , -lsb- the tropical parasitic -rsb- chagas disease - by and large a lot of diseases that are being treated by drugs that have been in existence for a long time and there are no patent issues there .
in the future , of course , our ability to get new forms of antibiotics or to be able to treat hyper-tension with new classes of drugs or our ability to treat diabetes , i think they all will be affected by the kind of decisions governments are making today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 18.11.2010 nokia siemens lawsuit dropped by iranian plaintiffs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians accused nokia siemens of helping the regime two iranian plaintiffs had filed a case against nokia siemens in american federal court , where they had alleged that the sale of telecommunications surveillance technology to iran had resulted in arrest and torture . last wednesday , the attorney for two iranians who had sued nokia siemens networks in an american federal court withdrew their lawsuit .
in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia siemens networks has said that it is no longer involved in iran nokia siemens networks denies responsibility in response to the withdrawl , the company posted a statement to its website that the company " can not and should not be held responsible for the alleged actions of the iranian authorities . "
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia siemens networks has said that it is no longer involved in iran nokia siemens networks denies responsibility in response to the withdrawl , the company posted a statement to its website that the company " can not and should not be held responsible for the alleged actions of the iranian authorities . "
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

the government should do more to support cultural education at a young age , he says . deutsche welle : mr hoffmann , do you think there are enough museums , community cinemas and other similar cultural institutions in germany , or is there room for improvement ? hilmar hoffmann : there is definitely room for improvement .
it 's always only the big cities which have an extensive collection of museums - like berlin , hamburg , munich , stuttgart or frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar hoffmann would like to see culture mentioned in the german constitution but think about the people in the countryside , which is a large majority of the population .
they did n't grow up with equal opportunity because they never had the chance to take advantage of cultural institutions . " culture for everyone " was your maxim during your time as head of the goethe-institut .
now that you are retired , how do you view the slogan " culture for everyone " in light of your current reality ? statistically speaking , culture for everyone is still a work in progress .
i would say that more than 15 percent of the population does not regularly participate in cultural events .
that 's why it 's important for schools to make aesthetic development and musical training part of their curriculum , so that every young person has the opportunity to grow up with equal opportunities and become a participant in the cultural offerings that they are paying for with their tax money . where do you see the biggest deficits ?
is it the schools that do n't see it as a priority , or is there just not enough money from the state ? i would say , the deficit can be found in politics , which has failed to bring about the necessary changes in the school curriculum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultural development should start young , says hoffmann here in the state of hesse , for example , we had a culture commission with great partners , and , in our concluding report , we stated that the ministry of culture and the ministry of education finally had to start working together to start providing cultural education in schools .
and that 's true not just for hesse but for all the states .
and as long as those are competing ministries - competing as far as funding goes - things wo n't change . you mentioned politics .
there has also been an ongoing discussion about making culture national policy - something which you have advocated .
why is that ? because all kinds of special interests are secured in the constitution .
sport , for example , is considered a basic right .
why not culture ?
on the other hand , it is stated in the constitution that we are a kulturstaat -lrb- cultural state -rrb- .
that 's why it is the state 's job to ensure the opportunity for cultural development from the very beginning of our individuation - that is , in pre-school . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 18.11.2010 msf wants eu 's ' hands off ' life-saving generic drugs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed trade deal could spell death for many of india 's generic drug customers as the european union and india try to reach a free-trade agreement , the humanitarian group doctors without borders is concerned .
it 's afraid the deal could limit access to affordable generic drugs it relies on . the humanitarian organization doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- sources 80 percent of the anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- it uses to treat hiv / aids in the developing world from india .
india has become known as " the pharmacy of the developing world " for producing affordable , generic drugs .
but some activists warn that a proposed free-trade agreement between the european union and india could lead to tougher intellectual property regulations that could hamper access to cheap , generic indian medicines .
msf recently launched the ' europe !
hands off our medicine ' campaign to pressure the 27-member bloc into halting measures it says would substantially restrict access to inexpensive medicines for people in developing countries .
last week , in an open letter to european trade commissioner karel de gucht , msf warned that if the european commission pursues the trade deal " people who rely on these medicines to stay alive will be left without a lifeline and many are likely to die . "
deutsche welle talked to msf 's international president , dr. unni karunakara , about the campaign , as eu-india negotiations on the proposed free-trade agreement progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. unni karunakara heads doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- and opposes the trade deal deutsche welle : msf has accused the eu of trying to " shut off the tap of affordable medicines . "
why is india so important in the context of generic drugs globally ?
dr. unni karunakara : we have 160,000 hiv / aids patients now on treatment in africa alone , and 80 percent of the drugs that we use to treat our patients come from india .
so india is for us the pharmacy of the world .
this is where the drugs come from that allow us to treat so many patients .
it is very important that this space exists in india for us to be able to continue to produce generic medications and our ability to actually use them as well .
the other concern is that increasingly the industry and other governments are characterizing generic drugs as counterfeit drugs .
that 's absolutely not the case .
generic drugs work as well as branded drugs , it 's just that they are not made by a company .
characterising generic drugs as fake , counterfeit or substandard is actually doing a disservice , and it 's going to affect our ability to treat patients in africa big time .
and that 's why we are concerned , and that 's why we have launched this campaign .
the campaign slogan leaves little doubt that you 're suggesting interference by europe in the production and distribution of various life-saving drugs .
but can msf and others push their argument forward using a rights perspective ?
i think the big victory in the doha rounds was that intellectual property rights are in opposition to large public health concerns ; the government has the right to overturn the pattern .
i think we need to keep that ; we ca n't afford to lose that .
what governments are trying to do is to enter into bilateral agreements to undermine this sort of international agreement -lsb- doha declaration -rsb- and , by underhand methods , trying to again shut down the production of generics .
for us this is a huge problem .
europe and other western governments are trying to bind india to a deal that will hit the production of generics and you say deprive millions of patients of affordable drugs .
how can countries that are often seen as benign donors justify this ?
i think it 's a question of " does the right hand know what the left hand is doing . "
i think there are different parts of the government or different parts of the european union that are engaged in negotiations .
the european commission humanitarian aid and civil protection , as we know , is trying to promote humanitarian action , has a large amount of funding for humanitarian work that is going on .
at the same time , the trade and commerce people are , of course , interested in protecting their interests , whether it 's in europe or in america .
i think sometimes these things come in to competition , and we are relying on the good will of the public to tell their politicians what matters most .
we 've had great successes in the past , and we hope that this campaign will also help get our concerns heard , and that the citizens will also express their opinion on this matter , and force their governments to back down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. karunakara urges india to realize the impact of its drug industry on global health based on developments so far , is it realistic to expect that the two sides can modify the proposed eu-india free-trade agreement enough to dispel your concerns ?
we always put the pressure on the european governments ; i think the indian government also needs to live up to its role as an aspiring superpower .
i do n't think many people in india fully realize the impact of the indian drug industry on the lives of people outside india .
and i think this is something they need to know .
they need to know that they are serving a larger purpose .
the government needs to take a firm stand and it can do it .
i 'm personally hopeful that the negotiations will go in the right direction .
i think india should step up to addressing this problem and consider the lives of so many - 4 million people on treatment in africa alone - and that is not just msf but all patients , and many of them rely on indian drugs .
msf also claims that the european commission is attacking not only the production of generic medicines , but also their registration , transportation and export .
as far as i understand , any drug that passes through a european port , the consignment can be confiscated and even destroyed .
so that 's also a very important part of the problem .
we want the eu to not enforce this very arbitrary kind of decision that they have made .
msf has said the eu-india deal is only a fraction of the attacks on the generic medicine industry .
where else are the obstacles being placed and what kind of an impact are they going to have ?
the us and the pharmaceutical industry are right now in india , challenging patents that are being granted by the indian government or trying to gain patents for certain drugs which the indian government has deemed not worthy of patent .
the efforts are going on in many different forums , so i think this is a multi-pronged attack from the industry and governments to address this issue once and for all .
and we just ca n't let that happen .
apart from the hiv / aids medicines you are distributing , what other diseases and health conditions are we talking about when we refer to generics from india ?
as far as other diseases are concerned , a lot of those we treat - neglected tropical diseases like sleeping sickness -lsb- which is endemic to sub-saharan africa -rsb- , -lsb- the tropical parasitic -rsb- chagas disease - by and large a lot of diseases that are being treated by drugs that have been in existence for a long time and there are no patent issues there .
in the future , of course , our ability to get new forms of antibiotics or to be able to treat hyper-tension with new classes of drugs or our ability to treat diabetes , i think they all will be affected by the kind of decisions governments are making today .

it 's afraid the deal could limit access to affordable generic drugs it relies on . the humanitarian organization doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- sources 80 percent of the anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- it uses to treat hiv / aids in the developing world from india .
india has become known as " the pharmacy of the developing world " for producing affordable , generic drugs .
but some activists warn that a proposed free-trade agreement between the european union and india could lead to tougher intellectual property regulations that could hamper access to cheap , generic indian medicines .
msf recently launched the ' europe !
hands off our medicine ' campaign to pressure the 27-member bloc into halting measures it says would substantially restrict access to inexpensive medicines for people in developing countries .
last week , in an open letter to european trade commissioner karel de gucht , msf warned that if the european commission pursues the trade deal " people who rely on these medicines to stay alive will be left without a lifeline and many are likely to die . "
deutsche welle talked to msf 's international president , dr. unni karunakara , about the campaign , as eu-india negotiations on the proposed free-trade agreement progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. unni karunakara heads doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- and opposes the trade deal deutsche welle : msf has accused the eu of trying to " shut off the tap of affordable medicines . "
why is india so important in the context of generic drugs globally ?
dr. unni karunakara : we have 160,000 hiv / aids patients now on treatment in africa alone , and 80 percent of the drugs that we use to treat our patients come from india .
so india is for us the pharmacy of the world .
this is where the drugs come from that allow us to treat so many patients .
it is very important that this space exists in india for us to be able to continue to produce generic medications and our ability to actually use them as well .
the other concern is that increasingly the industry and other governments are characterizing generic drugs as counterfeit drugs .
that 's absolutely not the case .
generic drugs work as well as branded drugs , it 's just that they are not made by a company .
characterising generic drugs as fake , counterfeit or substandard is actually doing a disservice , and it 's going to affect our ability to treat patients in africa big time .
and that 's why we are concerned , and that 's why we have launched this campaign .
the campaign slogan leaves little doubt that you 're suggesting interference by europe in the production and distribution of various life-saving drugs .
but can msf and others push their argument forward using a rights perspective ?
i think the big victory in the doha rounds was that intellectual property rights are in opposition to large public health concerns ; the government has the right to overturn the pattern .
i think we need to keep that ; we ca n't afford to lose that .
what governments are trying to do is to enter into bilateral agreements to undermine this sort of international agreement -lsb- doha declaration -rsb- and , by underhand methods , trying to again shut down the production of generics .
for us this is a huge problem .
europe and other western governments are trying to bind india to a deal that will hit the production of generics and you say deprive millions of patients of affordable drugs .
how can countries that are often seen as benign donors justify this ?
i think it 's a question of " does the right hand know what the left hand is doing . "
i think there are different parts of the government or different parts of the european union that are engaged in negotiations .
the european commission humanitarian aid and civil protection , as we know , is trying to promote humanitarian action , has a large amount of funding for humanitarian work that is going on .
at the same time , the trade and commerce people are , of course , interested in protecting their interests , whether it 's in europe or in america .
i think sometimes these things come in to competition , and we are relying on the good will of the public to tell their politicians what matters most .
we 've had great successes in the past , and we hope that this campaign will also help get our concerns heard , and that the citizens will also express their opinion on this matter , and force their governments to back down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. karunakara urges india to realize the impact of its drug industry on global health based on developments so far , is it realistic to expect that the two sides can modify the proposed eu-india free-trade agreement enough to dispel your concerns ?
we always put the pressure on the european governments ; i think the indian government also needs to live up to its role as an aspiring superpower .
i do n't think many people in india fully realize the impact of the indian drug industry on the lives of people outside india .
and i think this is something they need to know .
they need to know that they are serving a larger purpose .
the government needs to take a firm stand and it can do it .
i 'm personally hopeful that the negotiations will go in the right direction .
i think india should step up to addressing this problem and consider the lives of so many - 4 million people on treatment in africa alone - and that is not just msf but all patients , and many of them rely on indian drugs .
msf also claims that the european commission is attacking not only the production of generic medicines , but also their registration , transportation and export .
as far as i understand , any drug that passes through a european port , the consignment can be confiscated and even destroyed .
so that 's also a very important part of the problem .
we want the eu to not enforce this very arbitrary kind of decision that they have made .
msf has said the eu-india deal is only a fraction of the attacks on the generic medicine industry .
where else are the obstacles being placed and what kind of an impact are they going to have ?
the us and the pharmaceutical industry are right now in india , challenging patents that are being granted by the indian government or trying to gain patents for certain drugs which the indian government has deemed not worthy of patent .
the efforts are going on in many different forums , so i think this is a multi-pronged attack from the industry and governments to address this issue once and for all .
and we just ca n't let that happen .
apart from the hiv / aids medicines you are distributing , what other diseases and health conditions are we talking about when we refer to generics from india ?
as far as other diseases are concerned , a lot of those we treat - neglected tropical diseases like sleeping sickness -lsb- which is endemic to sub-saharan africa -rsb- , -lsb- the tropical parasitic -rsb- chagas disease - by and large a lot of diseases that are being treated by drugs that have been in existence for a long time and there are no patent issues there .
in the future , of course , our ability to get new forms of antibiotics or to be able to treat hyper-tension with new classes of drugs or our ability to treat diabetes , i think they all will be affected by the kind of decisions governments are making today .

'
this is unsurprising , considering the cut-throat price war in the air travel market . it may be the first time that air-rage has manifested itself as a communal sit-in .
a tense stand-off ensued tuesday night when around 90 passengers returning from morocco to paris refused to disembark from a ryanair flight that had landed three hours late – at liege airport in belgium .
there was a good explanation for the detour – fog had made a safe landing impossible at beauvais airport north of paris – but for over four hours passengers refused to travel the last 350 kilometers -lrb- 225 miles -rrb- on the buses provided by ryanair .
reports said the crew reacted by turning off the lights , locking the toilets and leaving the aircraft , but ryanair denied that version of events , whicle a spokesman for liege airport described the atmosphere as " really tense " and referred to " a few acts of violence " by the passengers .
whether this exceptionally angry protest was justified is open to question , but it marks a new low in relations between airlines and passengers .
coincidentally , it also comes in the same week that the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- released a damning survey of german customer satisfaction in the airline industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprisingly , there were fewer complaints about budget airlines the key conclusion of the survey was that the ' airline passenger rights ' introduced by the european union five years ago are often being ignored .
flouting the new rules the eu directive was designed to guarantee airline passengers compensation for cancelled or delayed flights , but many national governments have yet to devise the institutions that enforce these rules .
the vzbv 's survey - comprising 1,122 questionnaires - found that 80 percent of people were only informed of flight delays at the airport .
the report also said that only 25 percent were offered compensation or other services stipulated by the regulations , and then almost always only after having demanded it .
over half of those surveyed also said that they were not made aware of their passenger rights before their journey – another one of the eu 's stipulations .
according to vzbv lawyer sabine fischer-volk , it was n't just the budget airlines that failed to provide the service .
" more or less all airlines have been ignoring the passengers ' rights , " she told deutsche welle .
" we got the most complaints about lufthansa , condor , and air berlin – the high-end airlines . "
the survey should not be taken as a ratings table for airlines themselves , since those questioned flew mainly with airlines that operate in germany .
but the vzbv say their data shows a significant flouting of the rules by the airline industry in general .
good reasons apart from the problem of inadequate enforcement , fischer-volk pointed out the obvious economic reasons for the airline 's policy .
unlike the compensation offered by german rail operator deutsche bahn , for example , the eu-stipulated compensation is not tied to the cost of the flight tickets , but by the distance of the journey , and it is always between 250 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 338 - $ 810 -rrb- per passenger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister is in the middle of setting up a new arbitration committee " if you calculate that for a fully-booked airplane , that comes to roughly four times the cost of the flight , " said fischer-volk .
" and of course the airlines are going to do all they can to avoid paying that . "
the compensation payments are the same for budget airlines and high-end airlines , but since the high-end airlines have been losing passengers to the budget airlines , they are under considerable pressure to protect their profit margins .
arbitration committee in the works the vzbv also reported that airlines often systematically deprived passengers of their rights by delaying letters , while fines imposed by german authorities like the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- were not intimidating enough .
in an interview with financial daily handelsblatt , the chairman of the berlin branch of the vzbv , juergen kessler , said that by its nature the lba " is closer to the industry than it is to the consumers . "
this is a key reason why a new arbitration committee is needed .
" the lba is not an arbitrative body in the sense the eu requires , but a managing body that imposes fines , but does not make rulings , " said fischer-volk .
" that means that the only recourse for passengers not compensated by airlines is a civil court .
that is of course very cumbersome and very expensive , and it clogs courts with thousands of cases . "
the german government is currently in the process of setting up a new independent body , and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger recently told the tagesspiegel newspaper that " constructive " negotiations for were in progress .
" that would be a decisive step towards a proper arbitration committee , " said fischer-volk .
" of course the final step would be that if there was a legitimate claim the airlines would regulate themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 18.11.2010 private-army phenomenon exacerbates african conflicts , un says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soldiers from all over the world flock to war zones for pay a working group from the united nations has been visiting south africa this week to investigate the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and discuss ways to enforce legal regulations . africa is a continent that seems to be perpetually at war with itself .
nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 18.11.2010 european airlines flout passenger rights , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are being denied their rights a new report from germany 's consumer protection body says that european airlines are flouting eu regulations on ‘ passenger rights . '
this is unsurprising , considering the cut-throat price war in the air travel market . it may be the first time that air-rage has manifested itself as a communal sit-in .
a tense stand-off ensued tuesday night when around 90 passengers returning from morocco to paris refused to disembark from a ryanair flight that had landed three hours late – at liege airport in belgium .
there was a good explanation for the detour – fog had made a safe landing impossible at beauvais airport north of paris – but for over four hours passengers refused to travel the last 350 kilometers -lrb- 225 miles -rrb- on the buses provided by ryanair .
reports said the crew reacted by turning off the lights , locking the toilets and leaving the aircraft , but ryanair denied that version of events , whicle a spokesman for liege airport described the atmosphere as " really tense " and referred to " a few acts of violence " by the passengers .
whether this exceptionally angry protest was justified is open to question , but it marks a new low in relations between airlines and passengers .
coincidentally , it also comes in the same week that the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- released a damning survey of german customer satisfaction in the airline industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprisingly , there were fewer complaints about budget airlines the key conclusion of the survey was that the ' airline passenger rights ' introduced by the european union five years ago are often being ignored .
flouting the new rules the eu directive was designed to guarantee airline passengers compensation for cancelled or delayed flights , but many national governments have yet to devise the institutions that enforce these rules .
the vzbv 's survey - comprising 1,122 questionnaires - found that 80 percent of people were only informed of flight delays at the airport .
the report also said that only 25 percent were offered compensation or other services stipulated by the regulations , and then almost always only after having demanded it .
over half of those surveyed also said that they were not made aware of their passenger rights before their journey – another one of the eu 's stipulations .
according to vzbv lawyer sabine fischer-volk , it was n't just the budget airlines that failed to provide the service .
" more or less all airlines have been ignoring the passengers ' rights , " she told deutsche welle .
" we got the most complaints about lufthansa , condor , and air berlin – the high-end airlines . "
the survey should not be taken as a ratings table for airlines themselves , since those questioned flew mainly with airlines that operate in germany .
but the vzbv say their data shows a significant flouting of the rules by the airline industry in general .
good reasons apart from the problem of inadequate enforcement , fischer-volk pointed out the obvious economic reasons for the airline 's policy .
unlike the compensation offered by german rail operator deutsche bahn , for example , the eu-stipulated compensation is not tied to the cost of the flight tickets , but by the distance of the journey , and it is always between 250 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 338 - $ 810 -rrb- per passenger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister is in the middle of setting up a new arbitration committee " if you calculate that for a fully-booked airplane , that comes to roughly four times the cost of the flight , " said fischer-volk .
" and of course the airlines are going to do all they can to avoid paying that . "
the compensation payments are the same for budget airlines and high-end airlines , but since the high-end airlines have been losing passengers to the budget airlines , they are under considerable pressure to protect their profit margins .
arbitration committee in the works the vzbv also reported that airlines often systematically deprived passengers of their rights by delaying letters , while fines imposed by german authorities like the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- were not intimidating enough .
in an interview with financial daily handelsblatt , the chairman of the berlin branch of the vzbv , juergen kessler , said that by its nature the lba " is closer to the industry than it is to the consumers . "
this is a key reason why a new arbitration committee is needed .
" the lba is not an arbitrative body in the sense the eu requires , but a managing body that imposes fines , but does not make rulings , " said fischer-volk .
" that means that the only recourse for passengers not compensated by airlines is a civil court .
that is of course very cumbersome and very expensive , and it clogs courts with thousands of cases . "
the german government is currently in the process of setting up a new independent body , and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger recently told the tagesspiegel newspaper that " constructive " negotiations for were in progress .
" that would be a decisive step towards a proper arbitration committee , " said fischer-volk .
" of course the final step would be that if there was a legitimate claim the airlines would regulate themselves .
then we would n't need the committee . "

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .

those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .

all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .
despite a negative reaction from the international community , no one in the osce has said that they are uncomfortable with the fact that the country which is hosting the meeting , it is violating the rules .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .
despite a negative reaction from the international community , no one in the osce has said that they are uncomfortable with the fact that the country which is hosting the meeting , it is violating the rules .

the government has been using an emergency decree to target opposition media . ever since dozens were killed and hundreds injured in may , in the worst political violence seen in thailand for decades , the government has said it is in favor of national reconciliation .
yet , an emergency decree remains in force and the pro-opposition media have been targeted . " this allows the government to just shut down any website or any radio station or television without the proper use of law , " supinya klangnarong , a respected media rights advocate in thailand , who is currently vice-chair of the campaign for popular media reform , told deutsche welle . " the government does n't want to allow the opposition to exercise or express much because it is worried this could lead to another chaotic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reform activist supinya klangarong calls for open dialogue deeply divided nation " thailand is a deeply divided nation , " supinya klangnarong points out . the political conflict between the " red-shirted " poor , both urban and rural , and the " yellow-shirted " urban elites , which includes the royalists , bureaucrats and military top brass is becoming more entrenched . the young activist , who shot to fame in 2006 when she publicly challenged the then prime minister thaksin shinawatra , describes a silent majority caught between two increasingly passionate groups without means of finding a voice . she advocates a more open atmosphere where people can discuss their different points of view and has urged the government to make its criteria for what can or can not be said clearer . media should encourage open dialogue moreover , she has called on certain parts of the media to be less partisan , pointing out that 90 percent of thais rely on broadcast media rather than the internet , which is difficult to access , for information . " if the mass media did their job , " she says , " if they called the right agenda against the government , questioning the rule of law and also raising different voices and ideas , this would help shape the future of thai politics in a proper way . " there are some 8,000 unlicensed community radios in thailand , as well as hundreds of cable and satellite television stations .
the 2008 printing act allowed print media to publish anything , but the emergency decree has been used to censor opposition media without transparency or accountability . " bildunterschrift : in may , thailand witnessed its worst political violence in contemporary history she also suggests that the partisan media engage in more peaceful dialogue , to avoid drawing negative attention . behind-the-scenes role of the monarchy some analysts argue that the confusion around king bhumibol 's succession is also hindering national reconciliation in thailand . although the 82-year-old monarch is popular , his son and presumed heir crown prince maha vajiralongkorn is not considered capable of bridging the political divide . supinya klangnarong thinks it is hard to gauge how important the monarchy 's behind-the-scenes role really is . " the role of the monarchy is supposed not to be connected with the government or any political groups but it would seem that different sides have been politicizing the issue and the laws related to lese majeste are being used by the government to silence critics or dissidents , " she explains . " we do not have a clue about how this can be solved because it 's a really serious and sensitive issue , which people do not dare talk about in public . " unpredictability of thai politics even elections , which are due next year , might not resolve the situation in thailand .
observers say that the pheu thai party , the third reincarnation of a party founded by thaksin shinawatra , could well win , angering the " yellows " and many in the military , which reportedly is also divided .
more protests or even a military coup could be possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear next year 's elections could lead to more clashes or even a military coup supinya could not forecast whether the polls would go ahead at all : " honestly , i really believe we will see them happen , but i 'm also worried that they could be delayed for whatever reason .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 18.11.2010 private-army phenomenon exacerbates african conflicts , un says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soldiers from all over the world flock to war zones for pay a working group from the united nations has been visiting south africa this week to investigate the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and discuss ways to enforce legal regulations . africa is a continent that seems to be perpetually at war with itself .
nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 18.11.2010 private-army phenomenon exacerbates african conflicts , un says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soldiers from all over the world flock to war zones for pay a working group from the united nations has been visiting south africa this week to investigate the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and discuss ways to enforce legal regulations . africa is a continent that seems to be perpetually at war with itself .
nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia siemens networks has said that it is no longer involved in iran nokia siemens networks denies responsibility in response to the withdrawl , the company posted a statement to its website that the company " can not and should not be held responsible for the alleged actions of the iranian authorities . "
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

once at a point of virtual extinction , it 's now gaining on france in terms of the number of films currently being produced .
and at this year 's berlin international film festival in february , the golden bear went to turkish director semih kaplanoglu for his film " honey . " within this revival of turkish film , there is now a growing number of women directors - and it 's not only their gender that is making them stand out in the industry .
it 's also the fearlessness of the subjects they are taking on in their films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaplanoglu 's win in berlin thrust the turkish film industry into the limelight questioning family ties stunningly shot in the foreboding mountains of turkey 's black sea , " zephyr " tells the story of a single mother who leaves her young daughter with the girl 's grandparents in order to pursue a career overseas .
it deals with dark , often unspoken issues like abandonment and mortality within the family , as well as questions surrounding love and motherhood . " zephyr " is the first feature film of director belma bas , who says that taboos are a burden to men and women alike . " we really have to break those taboos , to take a step forward to solve really primal problems , which are at the core of very disturbing issues of this country , " bas told deutsche welle .
" we have to start from somewhere .
those mother-child and parent-child relationships are at the core of these things . the film director added that she 's not satisfied with getting a " macro-vision of society , " but that the only way to solve problems is to go deeper and take a closer look . criticism from women the lead female character in " zephyr " is often portrayed in a less-than-positive light , which bas says allowed her to avoid a feminist discourse .
the grandmother character is a voice of conservatism condemning her daughter , who in turn is defended by her father .
it is the nuanced nature of the film that has proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bas wants her audience to rethink family relationships at last month 's film festival in antalya , the country 's most prestigious film event , " zephyr " drew condemnation from some female critics for its unsympathetic portrayal of lead female characters . " zephyr " was one of two films by women directors to compete in the main competition , a first for the festival and an indication of the growing number of female directors in turkish film . revitalizing a tradition according to film and media professor tul akbal sualp , women filmmakers are both following a long tradition in turkish culture , and bringing a new cutting edge to turkish cinema . " it is a conservative society , but starting from the late 19th century , if you look at the literature and especially the poetry , we have women characters - strong characters - as often as male ones , " said sualp . these 19th-century works were far more political than those of current generation , sualp said , adding that only recently have the female newcomers to the film scene started approaching social and political problems more so than their predecessors . winning acceptance " merry-go-around , " the second film by director ilksen basarir , deals with a dark taboo : incest .
a first for turkey , the film also participated recently in the antalya film festival . it was the sensitive subject matter , not her gender , that made it difficult to get financing , said basarir , although it has not always been like that . " in turkey in the last five years , the women directors have become stronger , " she said .
" we want to tell our stories to the people and maybe they will start to accept us in this film industry . " early on , she wanted to become a camera assistant , but was told that was out of the question because she would have to carry heavy objects .
" but now things are changing : there are -lsb- female -rsb- lighting assistants , camera assistants , directors - so it 's changed , " said basarir . currently , more than 100 films are in production in turkey .
while the majority of mainstream film directors are still men - as in the rest of the world - that may soon change as well , says bas . " recently , there is no majority of males anymore in documentary- and short-filmmaking in turkey , " she said .
" -lsb- women -rsb- are coming forward to make feature length films as well .
i just long for the day when there will be no naming of female or male filmmakers . " author : dorian jones , istanbul -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

'
this is unsurprising , considering the cut-throat price war in the air travel market . it may be the first time that air-rage has manifested itself as a communal sit-in .
a tense stand-off ensued tuesday night when around 90 passengers returning from morocco to paris refused to disembark from a ryanair flight that had landed three hours late – at liege airport in belgium .
there was a good explanation for the detour – fog had made a safe landing impossible at beauvais airport north of paris – but for over four hours passengers refused to travel the last 350 kilometers -lrb- 225 miles -rrb- on the buses provided by ryanair .
reports said the crew reacted by turning off the lights , locking the toilets and leaving the aircraft , but ryanair denied that version of events , whicle a spokesman for liege airport described the atmosphere as " really tense " and referred to " a few acts of violence " by the passengers .
whether this exceptionally angry protest was justified is open to question , but it marks a new low in relations between airlines and passengers .
coincidentally , it also comes in the same week that the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- released a damning survey of german customer satisfaction in the airline industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprisingly , there were fewer complaints about budget airlines the key conclusion of the survey was that the ' airline passenger rights ' introduced by the european union five years ago are often being ignored .
flouting the new rules the eu directive was designed to guarantee airline passengers compensation for cancelled or delayed flights , but many national governments have yet to devise the institutions that enforce these rules .
the vzbv 's survey - comprising 1,122 questionnaires - found that 80 percent of people were only informed of flight delays at the airport .
the report also said that only 25 percent were offered compensation or other services stipulated by the regulations , and then almost always only after having demanded it .
over half of those surveyed also said that they were not made aware of their passenger rights before their journey – another one of the eu 's stipulations .
according to vzbv lawyer sabine fischer-volk , it was n't just the budget airlines that failed to provide the service .
" more or less all airlines have been ignoring the passengers ' rights , " she told deutsche welle .
" we got the most complaints about lufthansa , condor , and air berlin – the high-end airlines . "
the survey should not be taken as a ratings table for airlines themselves , since those questioned flew mainly with airlines that operate in germany .
but the vzbv say their data shows a significant flouting of the rules by the airline industry in general .
good reasons apart from the problem of inadequate enforcement , fischer-volk pointed out the obvious economic reasons for the airline 's policy .
unlike the compensation offered by german rail operator deutsche bahn , for example , the eu-stipulated compensation is not tied to the cost of the flight tickets , but by the distance of the journey , and it is always between 250 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 338 - $ 810 -rrb- per passenger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister is in the middle of setting up a new arbitration committee " if you calculate that for a fully-booked airplane , that comes to roughly four times the cost of the flight , " said fischer-volk .
" and of course the airlines are going to do all they can to avoid paying that . "
the compensation payments are the same for budget airlines and high-end airlines , but since the high-end airlines have been losing passengers to the budget airlines , they are under considerable pressure to protect their profit margins .
arbitration committee in the works the vzbv also reported that airlines often systematically deprived passengers of their rights by delaying letters , while fines imposed by german authorities like the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- were not intimidating enough .
in an interview with financial daily handelsblatt , the chairman of the berlin branch of the vzbv , juergen kessler , said that by its nature the lba " is closer to the industry than it is to the consumers . "
this is a key reason why a new arbitration committee is needed .
" the lba is not an arbitrative body in the sense the eu requires , but a managing body that imposes fines , but does not make rulings , " said fischer-volk .
" that means that the only recourse for passengers not compensated by airlines is a civil court .
that is of course very cumbersome and very expensive , and it clogs courts with thousands of cases . "
the german government is currently in the process of setting up a new independent body , and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger recently told the tagesspiegel newspaper that " constructive " negotiations for were in progress .
" that would be a decisive step towards a proper arbitration committee , " said fischer-volk .
" of course the final step would be that if there was a legitimate claim the airlines would regulate themselves .
then we would n't need the committee . "

china is now on the brink of revolutionizing the global plane industry . china is already the second largest aviation market after the us .
analysts believe it will become number one within 20 years . this week , at airshow china in zhuhai , the commercial aircraft corporation of china -lrb- comac -rrb- announced it had received its first 100 orders for its c919 . a prototype of the commercial aircraft is currently on display at the air show in the southern coastal city and has been attracting great attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the c919 is " cost-effective , comfortable and environment-friendly " among the buyers of the c919 are not only four domestic airlines – air china , china eastern , china southern and hainan airlines – but also a us leasing company that belongs to general electrics . 4,000 new aircraft needed to meet growing demand the aircraft , which has 190 seats , is scheduled to make its maiden flight in 2014 but the first deliveries will only begin in 2016 .
it has reportedly been developed to meet the huge demand of the fast-growing domestic market . according to the civil aviation administration of china , the country will need over 4,000 new civil aircraft to meet growing demand over the coming two decades . comac predicts that the sector will be worth more than 450 billion dollars by 2030 . dang tiehong , marketing research director at comac , is excited about the prospects : " as the center of the global economy is shifting , asia ’ s emerging markets , especially china , are going to be the main driving force for growth in the aviation sector . " according to our forecast , the passenger load for asia will be 37 percent worldwide in 2029 .
the annual passenger growth rate in mature markets , such as north america and europe , is going to be relatively small .

airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in the northern chinese city of tianjin in 2007 and has already put together nearly 30 aircraft there . just at the beginning of this month , china bought 102 new airbus planes when president hu jintao visited france . observers think the chinese-made c919 will be a potential competitor to the airbus a320 and the boeing 737 models in the not too distant future . an anonymous spokesman at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france told deutsche welle his company declined to comment on its competitors . but he did say airbus had constantly improved and " speeded up " its technologies and remarked that its standards could not be reached overnight .
however , he also admitted that china was developing very fast in this sector . author : miao tian editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .

"
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .

as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .

in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .

as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 irish central bank chief expects ' substantial eu loan ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu / imf bailout is on the irish horizon the head of ireland 's central bank has said the country will likely receive a multi-billion-euro loan to help save the country from financial meltdown .
this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet : the eurozone is in great need of governance speaking at a central banking conference in frankfurt , jean-claude trichet bemoaned the weakening of the stability and growth pact - which seeks to limit the budget deficits of eu member states to 3 percent of gdp - and called for " quantum leap " in economic governance in an " exceptionally demanding and uncertain " environment .
as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cyprus -pipe- 18.11.2010 united nations launches last-ditch effort to reunite cyprus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban has made cypriot reunification a top priority the un 's efforts to reunite the island nation of cyprus have been stalled .
as the possibility of a permanent division looms , the european green party is making its own efforts to restart the reunification process . united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon hosts the leadership of the greek and turkish cypriots on thursday in what is being described as a final effort by the un to revitalize reunification talks .
greek cypriot president dimitris christofias and dervis eroglu , president of the de facto turkish republic of northern cyprus , are to meet with ban in new york .
the un 's cyprus envoy , alexander downer , said the secretary-general " wants to hear face-to-face with the leaders their perspective of how the talks are going and what the prospects are . "
eighteen months of un-sponsored talks have ground to a virtual halt amid mutual recriminations .
there are growing signs that these talks could be the last and that the island 's partition could become essentially permanent - something that has the potential to scupper turkey 's efforts to join the european union .
eu intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cohn-bendit says ending the eu 's embargo could be a new impetus for reunification the european green party held talks in istanbul earlier this month , taking the opportunity to build support for its efforts to break the current stalemate in cyprus .
the party has proposed an end to the eu 's economic embargo against the turkish north as a first step in restarting reunification talks .
" the opening of north cyprus , of the ports and airports , is a question of trade , " said party co-chair daniel cohn-bendit .
" it 's a majority decision , so one nation can not block it .
so we are for the opening the ports and airports in northern cyprus .
then turkey will open its ports and airports for the greek cypriots . "
the initiative has been made possible under the lisbon treaty , which came into force last year and removed the right of eu member states to veto certain initiatives , including those related to trade .
until now the internationally recognized greek cypriot government has used its veto to stop any move to ease the trade restrictions on the north .
turkish military presence during his visit to istanbul , cohn-bendit met with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
he said the un 's cyprus talks needed fresh impetus , and that if the greens are successful in lifting the embargo it will open the door to concessions from turkey .
turkey is believed to have more than 40,000 soldiers on the turkish side of the island , and their removal remains a major stumbling block to reunification talks .
" we want turkey to say if trade is open with north cyprus , they will start to reduce the number of soldiers in north cyprus , " said cohn-bendit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey lends substantial military support to turkish northern cyprus support for reunification divided the greek cypriots are lobbying hard against any attempt to remove their veto over an end to the embargo , arguing that it is crucial to put pressure on the turkish cypriots to agree to reunification .
but the possibility of a permanent division of cyprus may lend support to the greens ' initiative .
ankara claims brussels had promised to end the embargo after the turkish cypriots in 2004 voted in a referendum to support a un-sponsored reunification plan , while greek cypriots voted against it .
turkey says it will not open its airports and ports to the greek cypriots until the embargo is lifted , and last week turkish eu affairs minister egemen bagis ruled out any new concessions over cyprus .
" by now turkey and turkish cypriots have proven time and time again that they believe in a solution and that they believe in a settlement , " he said .
" it 's now up to the greek cypriots to prove that they really do believe in a solution - a comprehensive settlement . "

those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .

all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .
despite a negative reaction from the international community , no one in the osce has said that they are uncomfortable with the fact that the country which is hosting the meeting , it is violating the rules .

" the new volunteer service is an invitation for people of all ages to serve the community , " german family minister kristina schroeder said in a statement . " i 'm confident that many people - not just young people - will take up this offer , " she added . bildunterschrift : the end of conscription means a shortage of social workers expected shortage the government plans to invest 350 million euros -lrb- $ 477 million -rrb- a year to fund 30,000 volunteers from july 2011 .
unlike the mandatory service , which is only served by young men after finishing school , the new service is open to men and women of all ages . it is designed to complement two existing volunteer schemes that offer 35,000 placements every year in either social or environmental services . under the proposed scheme , volunteers would receive pocket money of 324 euros a month in western germany and 273 euros in eastern germany .
they would also get their accommodation and social security contributions paid for . to make the service more attractive , the government is also mulling plans to have the voluntary social service count towards pension contributions . germany is expected to face a shortfall of carers , social and environmental workers from next year , after the government announced it would abolish national service as part of a revamp of germany 's military , the bundeswehr . conscription was introduced in west germany in 1957 , as part of the rearmament of the country after world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

the government has been using an emergency decree to target opposition media . ever since dozens were killed and hundreds injured in may , in the worst political violence seen in thailand for decades , the government has said it is in favor of national reconciliation .
yet , an emergency decree remains in force and the pro-opposition media have been targeted . " this allows the government to just shut down any website or any radio station or television without the proper use of law , " supinya klangnarong , a respected media rights advocate in thailand , who is currently vice-chair of the campaign for popular media reform , told deutsche welle . " the government does n't want to allow the opposition to exercise or express much because it is worried this could lead to another chaotic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reform activist supinya klangarong calls for open dialogue deeply divided nation " thailand is a deeply divided nation , " supinya klangnarong points out . the political conflict between the " red-shirted " poor , both urban and rural , and the " yellow-shirted " urban elites , which includes the royalists , bureaucrats and military top brass is becoming more entrenched . the young activist , who shot to fame in 2006 when she publicly challenged the then prime minister thaksin shinawatra , describes a silent majority caught between two increasingly passionate groups without means of finding a voice . she advocates a more open atmosphere where people can discuss their different points of view and has urged the government to make its criteria for what can or can not be said clearer . media should encourage open dialogue moreover , she has called on certain parts of the media to be less partisan , pointing out that 90 percent of thais rely on broadcast media rather than the internet , which is difficult to access , for information . " if the mass media did their job , " she says , " if they called the right agenda against the government , questioning the rule of law and also raising different voices and ideas , this would help shape the future of thai politics in a proper way . " there are some 8,000 unlicensed community radios in thailand , as well as hundreds of cable and satellite television stations .
the 2008 printing act allowed print media to publish anything , but the emergency decree has been used to censor opposition media without transparency or accountability . " bildunterschrift : in may , thailand witnessed its worst political violence in contemporary history she also suggests that the partisan media engage in more peaceful dialogue , to avoid drawing negative attention . behind-the-scenes role of the monarchy some analysts argue that the confusion around king bhumibol 's succession is also hindering national reconciliation in thailand . although the 82-year-old monarch is popular , his son and presumed heir crown prince maha vajiralongkorn is not considered capable of bridging the political divide . supinya klangnarong thinks it is hard to gauge how important the monarchy 's behind-the-scenes role really is . " the role of the monarchy is supposed not to be connected with the government or any political groups but it would seem that different sides have been politicizing the issue and the laws related to lese majeste are being used by the government to silence critics or dissidents , " she explains . " we do not have a clue about how this can be solved because it 's a really serious and sensitive issue , which people do not dare talk about in public . " unpredictability of thai politics even elections , which are due next year , might not resolve the situation in thailand .
observers say that the pheu thai party , the third reincarnation of a party founded by thaksin shinawatra , could well win , angering the " yellows " and many in the military , which reportedly is also divided .
more protests or even a military coup could be possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear next year 's elections could lead to more clashes or even a military coup supinya could not forecast whether the polls would go ahead at all : " honestly , i really believe we will see them happen , but i 'm also worried that they could be delayed for whatever reason .

the indications must be so concrete that he could not leave people in the dark about the dangers .
of course , people noticed the increased police presence at vulnerable sites on wednesday  it was up to the minister to give an explanation .
otherwise , the population might have felt even more intimidated .
criticism voiced by the leader of the opposition greens , juergen trittin , that the interior minister should be more specific , is narrow-minded . he probably ca n't be more specific without endangering the sources for his information .

there is reason for optimism that they will succeed again .

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

on the same day , in namibia , a suspected bomb was found on a plane headed for munich . the german government has urged citizens to remain calm and not to let the recent terror alerts affect their daily lives , according to a communique issued at a meeting of the interior ministers of the country 's 16 federal states .
" international terrorism aims to spread fear in our country .
this we will not allow , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at the gathering in the northern city of hamburg .
" we ask all citizens to continue living their lives as before , without fear , in peaceful cooperation with one another and heightened vigilance for one another . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' the talks came on the same day namibian police at windhoek airport intercepted a suspected bomb with a detonator and running clock on an air berlin plane bound for munich .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- said on thursday that the device was found inside a laptop case wrapped in plastic , adding that investigations were ongoing as to whether the explosive would detonate .
germany is on heightened alert following wednesday 's announcement that a terrorist attack was being planned for the country .
daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported that the united states had told berlin that between two to four al-qaeda militants were on their way to germany and britain to attempt attacks at the end of november .
among the targets are said to be germany 's popular christmas markets , scheduled to open in the coming days .
security has been stepped up at airports and train stations across the country , and de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere told reporters at a news conference in berlin on wednesday .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
calls for tougher security meanwhile , the head of germany 's police union has criticized the government for not sufficiently preparing the german public for possible terrorist attacks .
in comments made to the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt , konrad freiberg said on thursday that there were " serious security deficits , " and that " everything humanly possible " must be done " to protect the public from risk . "
in the wake of the wednesday 's announcement , government officials on thursday also called for a tougher security laws . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are baffled as to how the device made it aboard hans-peter uhl , of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , called for an increased focus on public surveillance and the monitoring of telecommunications and data collection .
" only the intelligence services can help us identify terrorist threats early enough , " he told the daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 18.11.2010 msf wants eu 's ' hands off ' life-saving generic drugs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed trade deal could spell death for many of india 's generic drug customers as the european union and india try to reach a free-trade agreement , the humanitarian group doctors without borders is concerned .
it 's afraid the deal could limit access to affordable generic drugs it relies on . the humanitarian organization doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- sources 80 percent of the anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- it uses to treat hiv / aids in the developing world from india .
india has become known as " the pharmacy of the developing world " for producing affordable , generic drugs .
but some activists warn that a proposed free-trade agreement between the european union and india could lead to tougher intellectual property regulations that could hamper access to cheap , generic indian medicines .
msf recently launched the ' europe !
hands off our medicine ' campaign to pressure the 27-member bloc into halting measures it says would substantially restrict access to inexpensive medicines for people in developing countries .
last week , in an open letter to european trade commissioner karel de gucht , msf warned that if the european commission pursues the trade deal " people who rely on these medicines to stay alive will be left without a lifeline and many are likely to die . "
deutsche welle talked to msf 's international president , dr. unni karunakara , about the campaign , as eu-india negotiations on the proposed free-trade agreement progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. unni karunakara heads doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- and opposes the trade deal deutsche welle : msf has accused the eu of trying to " shut off the tap of affordable medicines . "
why is india so important in the context of generic drugs globally ?
dr. unni karunakara : we have 160,000 hiv / aids patients now on treatment in africa alone , and 80 percent of the drugs that we use to treat our patients come from india .
so india is for us the pharmacy of the world .
this is where the drugs come from that allow us to treat so many patients .
it is very important that this space exists in india for us to be able to continue to produce generic medications and our ability to actually use them as well .
the other concern is that increasingly the industry and other governments are characterizing generic drugs as counterfeit drugs .
that 's absolutely not the case .
generic drugs work as well as branded drugs , it 's just that they are not made by a company .
characterising generic drugs as fake , counterfeit or substandard is actually doing a disservice , and it 's going to affect our ability to treat patients in africa big time .
and that 's why we are concerned , and that 's why we have launched this campaign .
the campaign slogan leaves little doubt that you 're suggesting interference by europe in the production and distribution of various life-saving drugs .
but can msf and others push their argument forward using a rights perspective ?
i think the big victory in the doha rounds was that intellectual property rights are in opposition to large public health concerns ; the government has the right to overturn the pattern .
i think we need to keep that ; we ca n't afford to lose that .
what governments are trying to do is to enter into bilateral agreements to undermine this sort of international agreement -lsb- doha declaration -rsb- and , by underhand methods , trying to again shut down the production of generics .
for us this is a huge problem .
europe and other western governments are trying to bind india to a deal that will hit the production of generics and you say deprive millions of patients of affordable drugs .
how can countries that are often seen as benign donors justify this ?
i think it 's a question of " does the right hand know what the left hand is doing . "
i think there are different parts of the government or different parts of the european union that are engaged in negotiations .
the european commission humanitarian aid and civil protection , as we know , is trying to promote humanitarian action , has a large amount of funding for humanitarian work that is going on .
at the same time , the trade and commerce people are , of course , interested in protecting their interests , whether it 's in europe or in america .
i think sometimes these things come in to competition , and we are relying on the good will of the public to tell their politicians what matters most .
we 've had great successes in the past , and we hope that this campaign will also help get our concerns heard , and that the citizens will also express their opinion on this matter , and force their governments to back down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. karunakara urges india to realize the impact of its drug industry on global health based on developments so far , is it realistic to expect that the two sides can modify the proposed eu-india free-trade agreement enough to dispel your concerns ?
we always put the pressure on the european governments ; i think the indian government also needs to live up to its role as an aspiring superpower .
i do n't think many people in india fully realize the impact of the indian drug industry on the lives of people outside india .
and i think this is something they need to know .
they need to know that they are serving a larger purpose .
the government needs to take a firm stand and it can do it .
i 'm personally hopeful that the negotiations will go in the right direction .
i think india should step up to addressing this problem and consider the lives of so many - 4 million people on treatment in africa alone - and that is not just msf but all patients , and many of them rely on indian drugs .
msf also claims that the european commission is attacking not only the production of generic medicines , but also their registration , transportation and export .
as far as i understand , any drug that passes through a european port , the consignment can be confiscated and even destroyed .
so that 's also a very important part of the problem .
we want the eu to not enforce this very arbitrary kind of decision that they have made .
msf has said the eu-india deal is only a fraction of the attacks on the generic medicine industry .
where else are the obstacles being placed and what kind of an impact are they going to have ?
the us and the pharmaceutical industry are right now in india , challenging patents that are being granted by the indian government or trying to gain patents for certain drugs which the indian government has deemed not worthy of patent .
the efforts are going on in many different forums , so i think this is a multi-pronged attack from the industry and governments to address this issue once and for all .
and we just ca n't let that happen .
apart from the hiv / aids medicines you are distributing , what other diseases and health conditions are we talking about when we refer to generics from india ?
as far as other diseases are concerned , a lot of those we treat - neglected tropical diseases like sleeping sickness -lsb- which is endemic to sub-saharan africa -rsb- , -lsb- the tropical parasitic -rsb- chagas disease - by and large a lot of diseases that are being treated by drugs that have been in existence for a long time and there are no patent issues there .
in the future , of course , our ability to get new forms of antibiotics or to be able to treat hyper-tension with new classes of drugs or our ability to treat diabetes , i think they all will be affected by the kind of decisions governments are making today .

but deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle is convinced it was the right decision to make the announcement . how will people react to the news ?
interior minister thomas de maiziere is n't usually one to propagate fear in order to prepare the ground for tougher security laws , which is why germans find his terror warning particularly disturbing .
will germans avoid soccer stadiums at the weekend ?
will they cancel planned trips or take the car instead of the plane or train in order to evade danger ?
in theory , everyone knows that the risk of dying in a car crash is bigger than falling victim to a terrorist attack .
but driving a car , people still have the feeling that they can control their fate to a certain degree .
at the airport , the train station or in a soccer stadium , however , people feel they are vulnerable , at the mercy of the evil intentions of lurking religious fanatics .

or should he have left it at his much less concrete appeal two weeks ago , when he said citizens should keep their eyes peeled and inform the police of suspicious goings-on ?
without knowing what de maiziere knows , we can presume that he would have done just that if it had been justifiable .
the indications must be so concrete that he could not leave people in the dark about the dangers .
of course , people noticed the increased police presence at vulnerable sites on wednesday  it was up to the minister to give an explanation .
otherwise , the population might have felt even more intimidated .
criticism voiced by the leader of the opposition greens , juergen trittin , that the interior minister should be more specific , is narrow-minded . he probably ca n't be more specific without endangering the sources for his information .
the public  s safety relies on these sources .
after all , it is thanks to their information channels that intelligence services repeatedly managed to avert planned terrorist attacks over the past few years .
there is reason for optimism that they will succeed again .

the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .

" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .

" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 18.11.2010 google launches street view across 20 german cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google navigated a web of privacy concerns in germany to publish its photos following much controversy , highly detailed street-level photographs are now available in berlin , cologne , hannover and beyond .
but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

but deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle is convinced it was the right decision to make the announcement . how will people react to the news ?
interior minister thomas de maiziere is n't usually one to propagate fear in order to prepare the ground for tougher security laws , which is why germans find his terror warning particularly disturbing .
will germans avoid soccer stadiums at the weekend ?
will they cancel planned trips or take the car instead of the plane or train in order to evade danger ?
in theory , everyone knows that the risk of dying in a car crash is bigger than falling victim to a terrorist attack .
but driving a car , people still have the feeling that they can control their fate to a certain degree .
at the airport , the train station or in a soccer stadium , however , people feel they are vulnerable , at the mercy of the evil intentions of lurking religious fanatics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the interior minister not have warned the public ?
or should he have left it at his much less concrete appeal two weeks ago , when he said citizens should keep their eyes peeled and inform the police of suspicious goings-on ?
without knowing what de maiziere knows , we can presume that he would have done just that if it had been justifiable .
the indications must be so concrete that he could not leave people in the dark about the dangers .
of course , people noticed the increased police presence at vulnerable sites on wednesday  it was up to the minister to give an explanation .
otherwise , the population might have felt even more intimidated .
criticism voiced by the leader of the opposition greens , juergen trittin , that the interior minister should be more specific , is narrow-minded . he probably ca n't be more specific without endangering the sources for his information .
the public  s safety relies on these sources .
after all , it is thanks to their information channels that intelligence services repeatedly managed to avert planned terrorist attacks over the past few years .
there is reason for optimism that they will succeed again .

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 irish central bank chief expects ' substantial eu loan ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu / imf bailout is on the irish horizon the head of ireland 's central bank has said the country will likely receive a multi-billion-euro loan to help save the country from financial meltdown .
this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet : the eurozone is in great need of governance speaking at a central banking conference in frankfurt , jean-claude trichet bemoaned the weakening of the stability and growth pact - which seeks to limit the budget deficits of eu member states to 3 percent of gdp - and called for " quantum leap " in economic governance in an " exceptionally demanding and uncertain " environment .
as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

on the same day , in namibia , a suspected bomb was found on a plane headed for munich . the german government has urged citizens to remain calm and not to let the recent terror alerts affect their daily lives , according to a communique issued at a meeting of the interior ministers of the country 's 16 federal states .
" international terrorism aims to spread fear in our country .
this we will not allow , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at the gathering in the northern city of hamburg .
" we ask all citizens to continue living their lives as before , without fear , in peaceful cooperation with one another and heightened vigilance for one another . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' the talks came on the same day namibian police at windhoek airport intercepted a suspected bomb with a detonator and running clock on an air berlin plane bound for munich .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- said on thursday that the device was found inside a laptop case wrapped in plastic , adding that investigations were ongoing as to whether the explosive would detonate .
germany is on heightened alert following wednesday 's announcement that a terrorist attack was being planned for the country .
daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported that the united states had told berlin that between two to four al-qaeda militants were on their way to germany and britain to attempt attacks at the end of november .
among the targets are said to be germany 's popular christmas markets , scheduled to open in the coming days .
security has been stepped up at airports and train stations across the country , and de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere told reporters at a news conference in berlin on wednesday .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
calls for tougher security meanwhile , the head of germany 's police union has criticized the government for not sufficiently preparing the german public for possible terrorist attacks .
in comments made to the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt , konrad freiberg said on thursday that there were " serious security deficits , " and that " everything humanly possible " must be done " to protect the public from risk . "
in the wake of the wednesday 's announcement , government officials on thursday also called for a tougher security laws . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are baffled as to how the device made it aboard hans-peter uhl , of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , called for an increased focus on public surveillance and the monitoring of telecommunications and data collection .
" only the intelligence services can help us identify terrorist threats early enough , " he told the daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger on thursday .
he said it was " completely unthinkable " that the public could be protected without data collection .
earlier this year , the federal constitutional court ruled that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data for up to six months was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
since march , the storage of such data has been outlawed , though certain government ministers have pushed for an early review of the decision .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , sees no need for tougher laws .
" the new threats are no reason for legislative changes , " he told the neuen osnabruecker zeitung newspaper , instead calling for calm and increased watchfulness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 18.11.2010 google launches street view across 20 german cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google navigated a web of privacy concerns in germany to publish its photos following much controversy , highly detailed street-level photographs are now available in berlin , cologne , hannover and beyond .
but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 18.11.2010 private-army phenomenon exacerbates african conflicts , un says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soldiers from all over the world flock to war zones for pay a working group from the united nations has been visiting south africa this week to investigate the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and discuss ways to enforce legal regulations . africa is a continent that seems to be perpetually at war with itself .
nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defendant faces 20 years in jail , but some say the case is a failure . a civilian jury has acquitted a former guantanamo bay inmate on multiple terror charges , but convicted him for plotting to bomb the us embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 .
among other charges , the defendant was cleared of 276 counts of attempted murder , due in part to key evidence being deemed inadmissible by the court .
" we respect the jury 's verdict and are pleased that ahmed ghailani now faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a potential life sentence for his role in the embassy bombings , " a spokesman for the us justice department said after the trial .
critics of president barack obama 's policy of trying guantanamo bay detainees in civilian courts , rather than by military tribunal , say the trial has highlighted the flaws in this strategy .
" we are at war with al qaeda , " republican senator lindsey graham said after the verdict was announced .
" members of the organization , and their associates , should be treated as warriors , not common criminals .
we put our nation at risk by criminalizing the war . "
ahmed ghailani 's case had been chosen for civilian trial , in part , because it was deemed one where a conviction was considered particularly probable .
a further 174 terror suspects are being held at the military detention center in guantanamo bay , awaiting trial .
" going forward , i once again strongly encourage the obama administration to use military commissions to prosecute enemy combatants , particularly the 9/11 conspirators like khalid sheikh mohammed , held at guantanamo bay , cuba , " senator graham said .
entrenched stances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil trials can be complicated after defendants have been denied rights arguably the biggest setback for the prosecution was an initial ruling from the judge , lewis kaplan , not to admit testimony from the government 's star witness , who had been expected to say he sold ghailani explosives .
kaplan said hussein abebe could not take to the stand because he had been identified through information obtained from ghailani while under extreme duress in cia custody .
" the civil court also indicated that the statements which could have led to a tougher sentence probably would n't have been accepted by a military tribunal either , " a professor in political and american sciences at the university of jena , michael dreyer , told deutsche welle .
" that 's because the evidence was obtained , in part , by way of torture - or rather by what is sometimes called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' in the us , but is generally called ' torture ' in the rest of the world . "
dreyer said that the issue has become more about politics than legal issues , pointing to supreme court rulings saying that guantanamo detainees should still have the right to a civilian trial under us law .
he believes that the us opposition primarily sees the issue as a way to undermine obama 's policies on dealing with terror suspects .
" i think the battle lines are so clearly drawn now that genuine factors are hardly going to change anybody 's mind .
people have already formed their opinions , and are likely to stick to them . "
during the trial , prosecutors sought to portray the defendant as a co-conspirator who helped an al qaeda bomber prepare the truck bombs which slammed almost simultaneously into the us embassies in kenya and tanzania , killing 224 people and injuring thousands more .
ghailani 's defense attorney , peter quijano , called no witnesses of his own , but cross-examined state witnesses vigorously , and described his client as an innocent dupe , who was used by al qaeda , but knew little or nothing of their intentions .
" at the start of this trial , we believed that ahmed was truly innocent of all of these charges .
please understand that we still truly believe he is innocent of all of these charges , " quijano told reporters outside the court .
domestic dissatisfaction , international support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghailani was part of the bomb attacks on the us embassies in kenya and tanzania human rights group amnesty international , which has vehemently opposed the detainment center at guantanamo bay since its inception , praised the trial , and called on the us to ensure all future cases are tried in civilian courts .
" us politicians who are opposed to trials in federal courts for guantanamo detainees have chosen to ignore the conviction and are arguing that ahmed ghailani 's acquittal on the other charges demonstrates that civilian criminal trials are inappropriate , " amnesty 's bob freer said .
" if the only procedure that critics of ordinary criminal trials would accept is one that guarantees convictions regardless of evidence , then what has been demonstrated is a gross failure on their part to commit to the most basic principles of fairness . "
speaking to deutsche welle , relatives of some of the victims of the 1998 attacks in which ghailani played a part admitted they had hoped for a more clear-cut verdict .
" we accepted the verdict as it is , even if we have been affected , because we can do nothing - although we are not happy with the decision , " shaaban said mtullya , whose wife was killed in the blasts , said .
" you can be affected in such a way that no compensation can be paid for it .
and even if the attacker will be sentenced to death , that will change nothing .
so what you can do is to forgive and move forward with your life , " said okia omtata , who lost his nephew .
" we will seek the maximum sentence of life without parole when -lrb- ghailani -rrb- is sentenced in january , " us prosecuting attorney preet bharara said after the trial in new york .

nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .
despite a negative reaction from the international community , no one in the osce has said that they are uncomfortable with the fact that the country which is hosting the meeting , it is violating the rules .

" the new volunteer service is an invitation for people of all ages to serve the community , " german family minister kristina schroeder said in a statement . " i 'm confident that many people - not just young people - will take up this offer , " she added . bildunterschrift : the end of conscription means a shortage of social workers expected shortage the government plans to invest 350 million euros -lrb- $ 477 million -rrb- a year to fund 30,000 volunteers from july 2011 .
unlike the mandatory service , which is only served by young men after finishing school , the new service is open to men and women of all ages . it is designed to complement two existing volunteer schemes that offer 35,000 placements every year in either social or environmental services . under the proposed scheme , volunteers would receive pocket money of 324 euros a month in western germany and 273 euros in eastern germany .
they would also get their accommodation and social security contributions paid for . to make the service more attractive , the government is also mulling plans to have the voluntary social service count towards pension contributions . germany is expected to face a shortfall of carers , social and environmental workers from next year , after the government announced it would abolish national service as part of a revamp of germany 's military , the bundeswehr . conscription was introduced in west germany in 1957 , as part of the rearmament of the country after world war ii .

yet efforts to improve road safety seem unlikely to lower the death toll . five years ago , around 900 people died on cambodia 's roads annually .
by 2009 , that number had risen to more than 1,700 . last year , more than 300,000 vehicles were registered in cambodia , compared with just 38,000 vehicles in 2004 .
most are motorbikes , and they provide none of the protection of a car . bildunterschrift : cyclos are becoming a rarity on the roads of cambodia so it is hardly surprising that the number of road deaths has increased .
road safety campaigners fear that if nothing is done , the problem will get much worse . some way to go yet in january 2009 , a law making it compulsory for motorbike drivers to wear crash helmets was introduced .
until then less than 20 percent had worn helmets .
now the rate has gone up to over 80 percent – those who do not comply with the law can expect to be fined by the traffic police . the result so far is that the proportion of fatalities from head injuries has dropped from 86 percent of road deaths to 76 percent . sann socheata , the road safety program manager for handicap international-belgium , says this is a start but there is still some way to go . " it 's not really a big drop because it is not yet compulsory for motorbike passengers to wear a helmet .
so helmet wearing rate among passengers still very , very low at around 10 percent , " she says . speeding and drink driving are major factors data collected by handicap international from the police and the cambodian ministry of health show that speeding accounts for around half of all deaths ; and drink driving is also a big factor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prefer to simply avoid the dangers of the roads preap chanvibol , who heads the government ’ s department of land transport , says the data make it clear which areas policymakers should focus on : " speed limit , drink driving and helmet wearing .
more than 70 percent of motorcycle fatalities are due to head injuries . " part of the problem is that cambodia 's roads , which for decades were dreadful due to war and neglect , have improved markedly in recent years . a decade ago , most roads were so pot-holed and rutted that a driver would be lucky to average 20 kilometers an hour .
today , drivers can travel across the country at speeds in excess of 140 kilometers an hour . most dangerous roads in asean bloc preap chanvibol says cambodia now has the unenviable distinction of having the most dangerous roads in the asean regional bloc with more than 12 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles . however , some improvements are on their way .
next year the government will compel motorbike passengers to also wear helmets and there are also moves to increase fines . but even with these measures , as well as ongoing education campaigns in schools , sann socheata and other activists still expect that an average 2,240 people will be dying on the roads every year by 2020 . their aim is simply to slow the rate of increase .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 18.11.2010 private-army phenomenon exacerbates african conflicts , un says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soldiers from all over the world flock to war zones for pay a working group from the united nations has been visiting south africa this week to investigate the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and discuss ways to enforce legal regulations . africa is a continent that seems to be perpetually at war with itself .
nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .

the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .

nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .

once at a point of virtual extinction , it 's now gaining on france in terms of the number of films currently being produced .
and at this year 's berlin international film festival in february , the golden bear went to turkish director semih kaplanoglu for his film " honey . " within this revival of turkish film , there is now a growing number of women directors - and it 's not only their gender that is making them stand out in the industry .
it 's also the fearlessness of the subjects they are taking on in their films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaplanoglu 's win in berlin thrust the turkish film industry into the limelight questioning family ties stunningly shot in the foreboding mountains of turkey 's black sea , " zephyr " tells the story of a single mother who leaves her young daughter with the girl 's grandparents in order to pursue a career overseas .
it deals with dark , often unspoken issues like abandonment and mortality within the family , as well as questions surrounding love and motherhood . " zephyr " is the first feature film of director belma bas , who says that taboos are a burden to men and women alike . " we really have to break those taboos , to take a step forward to solve really primal problems , which are at the core of very disturbing issues of this country , " bas told deutsche welle .
" we have to start from somewhere .
those mother-child and parent-child relationships are at the core of these things . the film director added that she 's not satisfied with getting a " macro-vision of society , " but that the only way to solve problems is to go deeper and take a closer look . criticism from women the lead female character in " zephyr " is often portrayed in a less-than-positive light , which bas says allowed her to avoid a feminist discourse .
the grandmother character is a voice of conservatism condemning her daughter , who in turn is defended by her father .
it is the nuanced nature of the film that has proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bas wants her audience to rethink family relationships at last month 's film festival in antalya , the country 's most prestigious film event , " zephyr " drew condemnation from some female critics for its unsympathetic portrayal of lead female characters . " zephyr " was one of two films by women directors to compete in the main competition , a first for the festival and an indication of the growing number of female directors in turkish film . revitalizing a tradition according to film and media professor tul akbal sualp , women filmmakers are both following a long tradition in turkish culture , and bringing a new cutting edge to turkish cinema . " it is a conservative society , but starting from the late 19th century , if you look at the literature and especially the poetry , we have women characters - strong characters - as often as male ones , " said sualp . these 19th-century works were far more political than those of current generation , sualp said , adding that only recently have the female newcomers to the film scene started approaching social and political problems more so than their predecessors . winning acceptance " merry-go-around , " the second film by director ilksen basarir , deals with a dark taboo : incest .
a first for turkey , the film also participated recently in the antalya film festival . it was the sensitive subject matter , not her gender , that made it difficult to get financing , said basarir , although it has not always been like that . " in turkey in the last five years , the women directors have become stronger , " she said .
" we want to tell our stories to the people and maybe they will start to accept us in this film industry . " early on , she wanted to become a camera assistant , but was told that was out of the question because she would have to carry heavy objects .
" but now things are changing : there are -lsb- female -rsb- lighting assistants , camera assistants , directors - so it 's changed , " said basarir . currently , more than 100 films are in production in turkey .
while the majority of mainstream film directors are still men - as in the rest of the world - that may soon change as well , says bas . " recently , there is no majority of males anymore in documentary- and short-filmmaking in turkey , " she said .
" -lsb- women -rsb- are coming forward to make feature length films as well .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .

the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .

some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 irish central bank chief expects ' substantial eu loan ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu / imf bailout is on the irish horizon the head of ireland 's central bank has said the country will likely receive a multi-billion-euro loan to help save the country from financial meltdown .
this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet : the eurozone is in great need of governance speaking at a central banking conference in frankfurt , jean-claude trichet bemoaned the weakening of the stability and growth pact - which seeks to limit the budget deficits of eu member states to 3 percent of gdp - and called for " quantum leap " in economic governance in an " exceptionally demanding and uncertain " environment .
as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 18.11.2010 first guantanamo civilian trial delivers string of acquittals , and a conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghailani faces at least 20 years in prison , or a life sentence in the first civilian trial of a former guantanamo bay inmate , a new york jury has acquitted the accused on over 200 charges , convicting on one .
the defendant faces 20 years in jail , but some say the case is a failure . a civilian jury has acquitted a former guantanamo bay inmate on multiple terror charges , but convicted him for plotting to bomb the us embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 .
among other charges , the defendant was cleared of 276 counts of attempted murder , due in part to key evidence being deemed inadmissible by the court .
" we respect the jury 's verdict and are pleased that ahmed ghailani now faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a potential life sentence for his role in the embassy bombings , " a spokesman for the us justice department said after the trial .
critics of president barack obama 's policy of trying guantanamo bay detainees in civilian courts , rather than by military tribunal , say the trial has highlighted the flaws in this strategy .
" we are at war with al qaeda , " republican senator lindsey graham said after the verdict was announced .
" members of the organization , and their associates , should be treated as warriors , not common criminals .
we put our nation at risk by criminalizing the war . "
ahmed ghailani 's case had been chosen for civilian trial , in part , because it was deemed one where a conviction was considered particularly probable .
a further 174 terror suspects are being held at the military detention center in guantanamo bay , awaiting trial .
" going forward , i once again strongly encourage the obama administration to use military commissions to prosecute enemy combatants , particularly the 9/11 conspirators like khalid sheikh mohammed , held at guantanamo bay , cuba , " senator graham said .
entrenched stances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil trials can be complicated after defendants have been denied rights arguably the biggest setback for the prosecution was an initial ruling from the judge , lewis kaplan , not to admit testimony from the government 's star witness , who had been expected to say he sold ghailani explosives .
kaplan said hussein abebe could not take to the stand because he had been identified through information obtained from ghailani while under extreme duress in cia custody .
" the civil court also indicated that the statements which could have led to a tougher sentence probably would n't have been accepted by a military tribunal either , " a professor in political and american sciences at the university of jena , michael dreyer , told deutsche welle .
" that 's because the evidence was obtained , in part , by way of torture - or rather by what is sometimes called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' in the us , but is generally called ' torture ' in the rest of the world . "
dreyer said that the issue has become more about politics than legal issues , pointing to supreme court rulings saying that guantanamo detainees should still have the right to a civilian trial under us law .
he believes that the us opposition primarily sees the issue as a way to undermine obama 's policies on dealing with terror suspects .
" i think the battle lines are so clearly drawn now that genuine factors are hardly going to change anybody 's mind .
people have already formed their opinions , and are likely to stick to them . "
during the trial , prosecutors sought to portray the defendant as a co-conspirator who helped an al qaeda bomber prepare the truck bombs which slammed almost simultaneously into the us embassies in kenya and tanzania , killing 224 people and injuring thousands more .
ghailani 's defense attorney , peter quijano , called no witnesses of his own , but cross-examined state witnesses vigorously , and described his client as an innocent dupe , who was used by al qaeda , but knew little or nothing of their intentions .
" at the start of this trial , we believed that ahmed was truly innocent of all of these charges .
please understand that we still truly believe he is innocent of all of these charges , " quijano told reporters outside the court .
domestic dissatisfaction , international support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghailani was part of the bomb attacks on the us embassies in kenya and tanzania human rights group amnesty international , which has vehemently opposed the detainment center at guantanamo bay since its inception , praised the trial , and called on the us to ensure all future cases are tried in civilian courts .
" us politicians who are opposed to trials in federal courts for guantanamo detainees have chosen to ignore the conviction and are arguing that ahmed ghailani 's acquittal on the other charges demonstrates that civilian criminal trials are inappropriate , " amnesty 's bob freer said .
" if the only procedure that critics of ordinary criminal trials would accept is one that guarantees convictions regardless of evidence , then what has been demonstrated is a gross failure on their part to commit to the most basic principles of fairness . "
speaking to deutsche welle , relatives of some of the victims of the 1998 attacks in which ghailani played a part admitted they had hoped for a more clear-cut verdict .
" we accepted the verdict as it is , even if we have been affected , because we can do nothing - although we are not happy with the decision , " shaaban said mtullya , whose wife was killed in the blasts , said .
" you can be affected in such a way that no compensation can be paid for it .
and even if the attacker will be sentenced to death , that will change nothing .
so what you can do is to forgive and move forward with your life , " said okia omtata , who lost his nephew .
" we will seek the maximum sentence of life without parole when -lrb- ghailani -rrb- is sentenced in january , " us prosecuting attorney preet bharara said after the trial in new york .

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 18.11.2010 google launches street view across 20 german cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google navigated a web of privacy concerns in germany to publish its photos following much controversy , highly detailed street-level photographs are now available in berlin , cologne , hannover and beyond .
but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .

in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .

as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 18.11.2010 private-army phenomenon exacerbates african conflicts , un says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soldiers from all over the world flock to war zones for pay a working group from the united nations has been visiting south africa this week to investigate the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and discuss ways to enforce legal regulations . africa is a continent that seems to be perpetually at war with itself .
nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last night about 2.5 million pilgrims spent their night here in tents .
the symbolic stoning of the devil ends today – and so does the hajj .
i look at the kaaba one more time and almost feel a bit sad .
today , pilgrims will circle the kaaba seven times - and then it 's all over .
however , i 'll stay a little longer .
i will visit the city of jiddah and tell you about my experiences there . looking at the kaaba , a question by dw user " serubogo " comes to my mind .
he wondered whether islamic tradition says that heaven 's gate is located above the kaaba – and whether there 's even a non-fly zone around mecca for that reason . well , i 've never heard anything about that .
i asked some of the pilgrims , and they had n't heard about it either .
so i guess it 's another example of the fact that religious teachings and local or regional customs merge from time to time – in islam as well as in other religions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female pilgrims get a ride to the next stage of the hajj but even if there was a no-fly zone here , then it definitely does n't apply to helicopters !
because one can see them hovering above around the clock here , monitoring the pilgrimage and supporting the police and paramedics . still , as in previous years some pilgrims died during the hajj , but the numbers were apparently lower than earlier .
until now the authorities either could n't or didn ’ t want to give me any concrete figures . but apparently most of the deaths were related to traffic accidents .
unlike earlier , there were no mass panics as the security measures were improved significantly .
dw user nasyr muhammad is probably not the only one who was interested in this piece of information . susan 's dangerous assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taken from a helicopter - unfortunately not from susan susan baaghil has a vivid recollection of the events of 1997 when hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the chaos of that year ’ s hajj .
susan is considered saudi arabia ’ s first female press photographer .
she documented the catastrophe aboard a helicopter with its doors open .
" these assignments are dangerous , " she says .
" but being a photographer is my calling . " like me , susan , who is fluent in four languages , originally hails from yemen .
there are n't all that many female photographers in saudi arabia , but she says she feels accepted by her male colleagues .
by the way , she 's not only working for the reuters news agency – but also as a wedding photographer .
" the first thing i saw after i was born was n't my mother , but her camera ” , she says with a smile . poor and rich pilgrims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim pilgrims pray on the side of a street as a press photographer , susan has very high standards .
she does n't want to snap only the usual pictures of the huge crowds of pilgrims one often gets from the event .
instead she also wants to cover the places the saudi authorities are less keen for the world to see : like the tent cities of " illegal " pilgrims who came here without a visa or an official permit . most of them are poor people from saudi arabia and other countries who simply ca n't afford the costs of the hajj .
" my pictures are supposed to reveal how difficult it is for these people , " explains susan .
" my goal is that people feel for these poor pilgrims and perhaps help them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims stoning the devil at jamarat bridge in these tent cities the garbage is piling up : plastic bags , empty boxes , left over food that is left to rot - the stench is at times so bad that some pilgrims only walk around with their masks on .
there are simply far too few trash cans and many people are afraid of the spread of diseases . at the same time , there are quite a number of very affluent pilgrims .
i met a man who was given 7,000 euros from his mother to make sure he would have a comfortable hajj and could spend his nights in a luxury hotel .
that leads me to the question of dw user hayman said who asked how pilgrims spend their money during the hajj .
well , i don ’ t know how it is all spent in detail .
but i would guess that the hotels here are probably doing really well . consulting a doctor is free by the way , i am also living in a hotel here .
it 's a room with eight beds which i share it with pilgrims form lebanon , syria , and yemen .
last night we were really cold , because we had turned the air conditioner down too low – our own fault .
so today , i feel like a caught a little cold .
and my knee hurts too , so i ’ ll go see the pilgrimage physician . while i really miss germany , i like the fact that going to the hospital is free and totally unbureaucratic here .
i see a saudi physician called muhammad ali khalifa who studied in austria twenty years ago and still raves about the country and the people .
in a friendly tone , he reprimands me for having missed some vaccinations .
" is that a problem ? "
i ask him , a bit worried .

in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .

last night about 2.5 million pilgrims spent their night here in tents .
the symbolic stoning of the devil ends today – and so does the hajj .
i look at the kaaba one more time and almost feel a bit sad .
today , pilgrims will circle the kaaba seven times - and then it 's all over .
however , i 'll stay a little longer .
i will visit the city of jiddah and tell you about my experiences there . looking at the kaaba , a question by dw user " serubogo " comes to my mind .
he wondered whether islamic tradition says that heaven 's gate is located above the kaaba – and whether there 's even a non-fly zone around mecca for that reason . well , i 've never heard anything about that .
i asked some of the pilgrims , and they had n't heard about it either .
so i guess it 's another example of the fact that religious teachings and local or regional customs merge from time to time – in islam as well as in other religions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female pilgrims get a ride to the next stage of the hajj but even if there was a no-fly zone here , then it definitely does n't apply to helicopters !
because one can see them hovering above around the clock here , monitoring the pilgrimage and supporting the police and paramedics . still , as in previous years some pilgrims died during the hajj , but the numbers were apparently lower than earlier .
until now the authorities either could n't or didn ’ t want to give me any concrete figures . but apparently most of the deaths were related to traffic accidents .
unlike earlier , there were no mass panics as the security measures were improved significantly .
dw user nasyr muhammad is probably not the only one who was interested in this piece of information . susan 's dangerous assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taken from a helicopter - unfortunately not from susan susan baaghil has a vivid recollection of the events of 1997 when hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the chaos of that year ’ s hajj .
susan is considered saudi arabia ’ s first female press photographer .
she documented the catastrophe aboard a helicopter with its doors open .
" these assignments are dangerous , " she says .
" but being a photographer is my calling . " like me , susan , who is fluent in four languages , originally hails from yemen .
there are n't all that many female photographers in saudi arabia , but she says she feels accepted by her male colleagues .
by the way , she 's not only working for the reuters news agency – but also as a wedding photographer .
" the first thing i saw after i was born was n't my mother , but her camera ” , she says with a smile . poor and rich pilgrims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim pilgrims pray on the side of a street as a press photographer , susan has very high standards .
she does n't want to snap only the usual pictures of the huge crowds of pilgrims one often gets from the event .
instead she also wants to cover the places the saudi authorities are less keen for the world to see : like the tent cities of " illegal " pilgrims who came here without a visa or an official permit . most of them are poor people from saudi arabia and other countries who simply ca n't afford the costs of the hajj .
" my pictures are supposed to reveal how difficult it is for these people , " explains susan .
" my goal is that people feel for these poor pilgrims and perhaps help them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims stoning the devil at jamarat bridge in these tent cities the garbage is piling up : plastic bags , empty boxes , left over food that is left to rot - the stench is at times so bad that some pilgrims only walk around with their masks on .
there are simply far too few trash cans and many people are afraid of the spread of diseases . at the same time , there are quite a number of very affluent pilgrims .
i met a man who was given 7,000 euros from his mother to make sure he would have a comfortable hajj and could spend his nights in a luxury hotel .
that leads me to the question of dw user hayman said who asked how pilgrims spend their money during the hajj .
well , i don ’ t know how it is all spent in detail .
but i would guess that the hotels here are probably doing really well . consulting a doctor is free by the way , i am also living in a hotel here .
it 's a room with eight beds which i share it with pilgrims form lebanon , syria , and yemen .
last night we were really cold , because we had turned the air conditioner down too low – our own fault .
so today , i feel like a caught a little cold .
and my knee hurts too , so i ’ ll go see the pilgrimage physician . while i really miss germany , i like the fact that going to the hospital is free and totally unbureaucratic here .
i see a saudi physician called muhammad ali khalifa who studied in austria twenty years ago and still raves about the country and the people .
in a friendly tone , he reprimands me for having missed some vaccinations .
" is that a problem ? "
i ask him , a bit worried .
" no , " he replies .
" that ’ s okay .
there 's no danger of swine flu or meningitis during the hajj season . " thank god ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .

as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 18.11.2010 first guantanamo civilian trial delivers string of acquittals , and a conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghailani faces at least 20 years in prison , or a life sentence in the first civilian trial of a former guantanamo bay inmate , a new york jury has acquitted the accused on over 200 charges , convicting on one .
the defendant faces 20 years in jail , but some say the case is a failure . a civilian jury has acquitted a former guantanamo bay inmate on multiple terror charges , but convicted him for plotting to bomb the us embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 .
among other charges , the defendant was cleared of 276 counts of attempted murder , due in part to key evidence being deemed inadmissible by the court .
" we respect the jury 's verdict and are pleased that ahmed ghailani now faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a potential life sentence for his role in the embassy bombings , " a spokesman for the us justice department said after the trial .
critics of president barack obama 's policy of trying guantanamo bay detainees in civilian courts , rather than by military tribunal , say the trial has highlighted the flaws in this strategy .
" we are at war with al qaeda , " republican senator lindsey graham said after the verdict was announced .
" members of the organization , and their associates , should be treated as warriors , not common criminals .
we put our nation at risk by criminalizing the war . "
ahmed ghailani 's case had been chosen for civilian trial , in part , because it was deemed one where a conviction was considered particularly probable .
a further 174 terror suspects are being held at the military detention center in guantanamo bay , awaiting trial .
" going forward , i once again strongly encourage the obama administration to use military commissions to prosecute enemy combatants , particularly the 9/11 conspirators like khalid sheikh mohammed , held at guantanamo bay , cuba , " senator graham said .
entrenched stances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil trials can be complicated after defendants have been denied rights arguably the biggest setback for the prosecution was an initial ruling from the judge , lewis kaplan , not to admit testimony from the government 's star witness , who had been expected to say he sold ghailani explosives .
kaplan said hussein abebe could not take to the stand because he had been identified through information obtained from ghailani while under extreme duress in cia custody .
" the civil court also indicated that the statements which could have led to a tougher sentence probably would n't have been accepted by a military tribunal either , " a professor in political and american sciences at the university of jena , michael dreyer , told deutsche welle .
" that 's because the evidence was obtained , in part , by way of torture - or rather by what is sometimes called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' in the us , but is generally called ' torture ' in the rest of the world . "
dreyer said that the issue has become more about politics than legal issues , pointing to supreme court rulings saying that guantanamo detainees should still have the right to a civilian trial under us law .
he believes that the us opposition primarily sees the issue as a way to undermine obama 's policies on dealing with terror suspects .
" i think the battle lines are so clearly drawn now that genuine factors are hardly going to change anybody 's mind .
people have already formed their opinions , and are likely to stick to them . "
during the trial , prosecutors sought to portray the defendant as a co-conspirator who helped an al qaeda bomber prepare the truck bombs which slammed almost simultaneously into the us embassies in kenya and tanzania , killing 224 people and injuring thousands more .
ghailani 's defense attorney , peter quijano , called no witnesses of his own , but cross-examined state witnesses vigorously , and described his client as an innocent dupe , who was used by al qaeda , but knew little or nothing of their intentions .
" at the start of this trial , we believed that ahmed was truly innocent of all of these charges .
please understand that we still truly believe he is innocent of all of these charges , " quijano told reporters outside the court .
domestic dissatisfaction , international support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghailani was part of the bomb attacks on the us embassies in kenya and tanzania human rights group amnesty international , which has vehemently opposed the detainment center at guantanamo bay since its inception , praised the trial , and called on the us to ensure all future cases are tried in civilian courts .
" us politicians who are opposed to trials in federal courts for guantanamo detainees have chosen to ignore the conviction and are arguing that ahmed ghailani 's acquittal on the other charges demonstrates that civilian criminal trials are inappropriate , " amnesty 's bob freer said .
" if the only procedure that critics of ordinary criminal trials would accept is one that guarantees convictions regardless of evidence , then what has been demonstrated is a gross failure on their part to commit to the most basic principles of fairness . "
speaking to deutsche welle , relatives of some of the victims of the 1998 attacks in which ghailani played a part admitted they had hoped for a more clear-cut verdict .
" we accepted the verdict as it is , even if we have been affected , because we can do nothing - although we are not happy with the decision , " shaaban said mtullya , whose wife was killed in the blasts , said .
" you can be affected in such a way that no compensation can be paid for it .
and even if the attacker will be sentenced to death , that will change nothing .
so what you can do is to forgive and move forward with your life , " said okia omtata , who lost his nephew .
" we will seek the maximum sentence of life without parole when -lrb- ghailani -rrb- is sentenced in january , " us prosecuting attorney preet bharara said after the trial in new york .

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .

as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

but deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle is convinced it was the right decision to make the announcement . how will people react to the news ?
interior minister thomas de maiziere is n't usually one to propagate fear in order to prepare the ground for tougher security laws , which is why germans find his terror warning particularly disturbing .
will germans avoid soccer stadiums at the weekend ?
will they cancel planned trips or take the car instead of the plane or train in order to evade danger ?
in theory , everyone knows that the risk of dying in a car crash is bigger than falling victim to a terrorist attack .
but driving a car , people still have the feeling that they can control their fate to a certain degree .
at the airport , the train station or in a soccer stadium , however , people feel they are vulnerable , at the mercy of the evil intentions of lurking religious fanatics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the interior minister not have warned the public ?
or should he have left it at his much less concrete appeal two weeks ago , when he said citizens should keep their eyes peeled and inform the police of suspicious goings-on ?
without knowing what de maiziere knows , we can presume that he would have done just that if it had been justifiable .
the indications must be so concrete that he could not leave people in the dark about the dangers .
of course , people noticed the increased police presence at vulnerable sites on wednesday  it was up to the minister to give an explanation .
otherwise , the population might have felt even more intimidated .
criticism voiced by the leader of the opposition greens , juergen trittin , that the interior minister should be more specific , is narrow-minded . he probably ca n't be more specific without endangering the sources for his information .
the public  s safety relies on these sources .
after all , it is thanks to their information channels that intelligence services repeatedly managed to avert planned terrorist attacks over the past few years .
there is reason for optimism that they will succeed again .

yet efforts to improve road safety seem unlikely to lower the death toll . five years ago , around 900 people died on cambodia 's roads annually .
by 2009 , that number had risen to more than 1,700 . last year , more than 300,000 vehicles were registered in cambodia , compared with just 38,000 vehicles in 2004 .
most are motorbikes , and they provide none of the protection of a car . bildunterschrift : cyclos are becoming a rarity on the roads of cambodia so it is hardly surprising that the number of road deaths has increased .
road safety campaigners fear that if nothing is done , the problem will get much worse . some way to go yet in january 2009 , a law making it compulsory for motorbike drivers to wear crash helmets was introduced .
until then less than 20 percent had worn helmets .
now the rate has gone up to over 80 percent – those who do not comply with the law can expect to be fined by the traffic police . the result so far is that the proportion of fatalities from head injuries has dropped from 86 percent of road deaths to 76 percent . sann socheata , the road safety program manager for handicap international-belgium , says this is a start but there is still some way to go . " it 's not really a big drop because it is not yet compulsory for motorbike passengers to wear a helmet .
so helmet wearing rate among passengers still very , very low at around 10 percent , " she says . speeding and drink driving are major factors data collected by handicap international from the police and the cambodian ministry of health show that speeding accounts for around half of all deaths ; and drink driving is also a big factor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prefer to simply avoid the dangers of the roads preap chanvibol , who heads the government ’ s department of land transport , says the data make it clear which areas policymakers should focus on : " speed limit , drink driving and helmet wearing .
more than 70 percent of motorcycle fatalities are due to head injuries . " part of the problem is that cambodia 's roads , which for decades were dreadful due to war and neglect , have improved markedly in recent years . a decade ago , most roads were so pot-holed and rutted that a driver would be lucky to average 20 kilometers an hour .
today , drivers can travel across the country at speeds in excess of 140 kilometers an hour . most dangerous roads in asean bloc preap chanvibol says cambodia now has the unenviable distinction of having the most dangerous roads in the asean regional bloc with more than 12 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles . however , some improvements are on their way .
next year the government will compel motorbike passengers to also wear helmets and there are also moves to increase fines . but even with these measures , as well as ongoing education campaigns in schools , sann socheata and other activists still expect that an average 2,240 people will be dying on the roads every year by 2020 . their aim is simply to slow the rate of increase .

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2010 opinion : ' the minister could not have left people in the dark ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grave warning by the german government that a terrorist attack might be imminent has unsettled many people .
but deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle is convinced it was the right decision to make the announcement . how will people react to the news ?
interior minister thomas de maiziere is n't usually one to propagate fear in order to prepare the ground for tougher security laws , which is why germans find his terror warning particularly disturbing .
will germans avoid soccer stadiums at the weekend ?
will they cancel planned trips or take the car instead of the plane or train in order to evade danger ?
in theory , everyone knows that the risk of dying in a car crash is bigger than falling victim to a terrorist attack .
but driving a car , people still have the feeling that they can control their fate to a certain degree .
at the airport , the train station or in a soccer stadium , however , people feel they are vulnerable , at the mercy of the evil intentions of lurking religious fanatics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the interior minister not have warned the public ?
or should he have left it at his much less concrete appeal two weeks ago , when he said citizens should keep their eyes peeled and inform the police of suspicious goings-on ?
without knowing what de maiziere knows , we can presume that he would have done just that if it had been justifiable .
the indications must be so concrete that he could not leave people in the dark about the dangers .
of course , people noticed the increased police presence at vulnerable sites on wednesday  it was up to the minister to give an explanation .
otherwise , the population might have felt even more intimidated .
criticism voiced by the leader of the opposition greens , juergen trittin , that the interior minister should be more specific , is narrow-minded . he probably ca n't be more specific without endangering the sources for his information .
the public  s safety relies on these sources .
after all , it is thanks to their information channels that intelligence services repeatedly managed to avert planned terrorist attacks over the past few years .
there is reason for optimism that they will succeed again .

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .

on the same day , in namibia , a suspected bomb was found on a plane headed for munich . the german government has urged citizens to remain calm and not to let the recent terror alerts affect their daily lives , according to a communique issued at a meeting of the interior ministers of the country 's 16 federal states .
" international terrorism aims to spread fear in our country .
this we will not allow , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at the gathering in the northern city of hamburg .
" we ask all citizens to continue living their lives as before , without fear , in peaceful cooperation with one another and heightened vigilance for one another . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' the talks came on the same day namibian police at windhoek airport intercepted a suspected bomb with a detonator and running clock on an air berlin plane bound for munich .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- said on thursday that the device was found inside a laptop case wrapped in plastic , adding that investigations were ongoing as to whether the explosive would detonate .
germany is on heightened alert following wednesday 's announcement that a terrorist attack was being planned for the country .
daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported that the united states had told berlin that between two to four al-qaeda militants were on their way to germany and britain to attempt attacks at the end of november .
among the targets are said to be germany 's popular christmas markets , scheduled to open in the coming days .
security has been stepped up at airports and train stations across the country , and de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere told reporters at a news conference in berlin on wednesday .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
calls for tougher security meanwhile , the head of germany 's police union has criticized the government for not sufficiently preparing the german public for possible terrorist attacks .
in comments made to the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt , konrad freiberg said on thursday that there were " serious security deficits , " and that " everything humanly possible " must be done " to protect the public from risk . "
in the wake of the wednesday 's announcement , government officials on thursday also called for a tougher security laws . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are baffled as to how the device made it aboard hans-peter uhl , of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , called for an increased focus on public surveillance and the monitoring of telecommunications and data collection .
" only the intelligence services can help us identify terrorist threats early enough , " he told the daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger on thursday .
he said it was " completely unthinkable " that the public could be protected without data collection .
earlier this year , the federal constitutional court ruled that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data for up to six months was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
since march , the storage of such data has been outlawed , though certain government ministers have pushed for an early review of the decision .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , sees no need for tougher laws .
" the new threats are no reason for legislative changes , " he told the neuen osnabruecker zeitung newspaper , instead calling for calm and increased watchfulness .

nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia siemens networks has said that it is no longer involved in iran nokia siemens networks denies responsibility in response to the withdrawl , the company posted a statement to its website that the company " can not and should not be held responsible for the alleged actions of the iranian authorities . "
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .
" that 's a threat that no longer really exists . "
defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

once at a point of virtual extinction , it 's now gaining on france in terms of the number of films currently being produced .
and at this year 's berlin international film festival in february , the golden bear went to turkish director semih kaplanoglu for his film " honey . " within this revival of turkish film , there is now a growing number of women directors - and it 's not only their gender that is making them stand out in the industry .
it 's also the fearlessness of the subjects they are taking on in their films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaplanoglu 's win in berlin thrust the turkish film industry into the limelight questioning family ties stunningly shot in the foreboding mountains of turkey 's black sea , " zephyr " tells the story of a single mother who leaves her young daughter with the girl 's grandparents in order to pursue a career overseas .
it deals with dark , often unspoken issues like abandonment and mortality within the family , as well as questions surrounding love and motherhood . " zephyr " is the first feature film of director belma bas , who says that taboos are a burden to men and women alike . " we really have to break those taboos , to take a step forward to solve really primal problems , which are at the core of very disturbing issues of this country , " bas told deutsche welle .
" we have to start from somewhere .
those mother-child and parent-child relationships are at the core of these things . the film director added that she 's not satisfied with getting a " macro-vision of society , " but that the only way to solve problems is to go deeper and take a closer look . criticism from women the lead female character in " zephyr " is often portrayed in a less-than-positive light , which bas says allowed her to avoid a feminist discourse .
the grandmother character is a voice of conservatism condemning her daughter , who in turn is defended by her father .
it is the nuanced nature of the film that has proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bas wants her audience to rethink family relationships at last month 's film festival in antalya , the country 's most prestigious film event , " zephyr " drew condemnation from some female critics for its unsympathetic portrayal of lead female characters . " zephyr " was one of two films by women directors to compete in the main competition , a first for the festival and an indication of the growing number of female directors in turkish film . revitalizing a tradition according to film and media professor tul akbal sualp , women filmmakers are both following a long tradition in turkish culture , and bringing a new cutting edge to turkish cinema . " it is a conservative society , but starting from the late 19th century , if you look at the literature and especially the poetry , we have women characters - strong characters - as often as male ones , " said sualp . these 19th-century works were far more political than those of current generation , sualp said , adding that only recently have the female newcomers to the film scene started approaching social and political problems more so than their predecessors . winning acceptance " merry-go-around , " the second film by director ilksen basarir , deals with a dark taboo : incest .
a first for turkey , the film also participated recently in the antalya film festival . it was the sensitive subject matter , not her gender , that made it difficult to get financing , said basarir , although it has not always been like that . " in turkey in the last five years , the women directors have become stronger , " she said .
" we want to tell our stories to the people and maybe they will start to accept us in this film industry . " early on , she wanted to become a camera assistant , but was told that was out of the question because she would have to carry heavy objects .
" but now things are changing : there are -lsb- female -rsb- lighting assistants , camera assistants , directors - so it 's changed , " said basarir . currently , more than 100 films are in production in turkey .

once at a point of virtual extinction , it 's now gaining on france in terms of the number of films currently being produced .
and at this year 's berlin international film festival in february , the golden bear went to turkish director semih kaplanoglu for his film " honey . " within this revival of turkish film , there is now a growing number of women directors - and it 's not only their gender that is making them stand out in the industry .
it 's also the fearlessness of the subjects they are taking on in their films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaplanoglu 's win in berlin thrust the turkish film industry into the limelight questioning family ties stunningly shot in the foreboding mountains of turkey 's black sea , " zephyr " tells the story of a single mother who leaves her young daughter with the girl 's grandparents in order to pursue a career overseas .
it deals with dark , often unspoken issues like abandonment and mortality within the family , as well as questions surrounding love and motherhood . " zephyr " is the first feature film of director belma bas , who says that taboos are a burden to men and women alike . " we really have to break those taboos , to take a step forward to solve really primal problems , which are at the core of very disturbing issues of this country , " bas told deutsche welle .
" we have to start from somewhere .
those mother-child and parent-child relationships are at the core of these things . the film director added that she 's not satisfied with getting a " macro-vision of society , " but that the only way to solve problems is to go deeper and take a closer look . criticism from women the lead female character in " zephyr " is often portrayed in a less-than-positive light , which bas says allowed her to avoid a feminist discourse .
the grandmother character is a voice of conservatism condemning her daughter , who in turn is defended by her father .
it is the nuanced nature of the film that has proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bas wants her audience to rethink family relationships at last month 's film festival in antalya , the country 's most prestigious film event , " zephyr " drew condemnation from some female critics for its unsympathetic portrayal of lead female characters . " zephyr " was one of two films by women directors to compete in the main competition , a first for the festival and an indication of the growing number of female directors in turkish film . revitalizing a tradition according to film and media professor tul akbal sualp , women filmmakers are both following a long tradition in turkish culture , and bringing a new cutting edge to turkish cinema . " it is a conservative society , but starting from the late 19th century , if you look at the literature and especially the poetry , we have women characters - strong characters - as often as male ones , " said sualp . these 19th-century works were far more political than those of current generation , sualp said , adding that only recently have the female newcomers to the film scene started approaching social and political problems more so than their predecessors . winning acceptance " merry-go-around , " the second film by director ilksen basarir , deals with a dark taboo : incest .
a first for turkey , the film also participated recently in the antalya film festival . it was the sensitive subject matter , not her gender , that made it difficult to get financing , said basarir , although it has not always been like that . " in turkey in the last five years , the women directors have become stronger , " she said .
" we want to tell our stories to the people and maybe they will start to accept us in this film industry . " early on , she wanted to become a camera assistant , but was told that was out of the question because she would have to carry heavy objects .
" but now things are changing : there are -lsb- female -rsb- lighting assistants , camera assistants , directors - so it 's changed , " said basarir . currently , more than 100 films are in production in turkey .
while the majority of mainstream film directors are still men - as in the rest of the world - that may soon change as well , says bas . " recently , there is no majority of males anymore in documentary- and short-filmmaking in turkey , " she said .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .
despite a negative reaction from the international community , no one in the osce has said that they are uncomfortable with the fact that the country which is hosting the meeting , it is violating the rules .

on the same day , in namibia , a suspected bomb was found on a plane headed for munich . the german government has urged citizens to remain calm and not to let the recent terror alerts affect their daily lives , according to a communique issued at a meeting of the interior ministers of the country 's 16 federal states .
" international terrorism aims to spread fear in our country .
this we will not allow , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at the gathering in the northern city of hamburg .
" we ask all citizens to continue living their lives as before , without fear , in peaceful cooperation with one another and heightened vigilance for one another . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' the talks came on the same day namibian police at windhoek airport intercepted a suspected bomb with a detonator and running clock on an air berlin plane bound for munich .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- said on thursday that the device was found inside a laptop case wrapped in plastic , adding that investigations were ongoing as to whether the explosive would detonate .
germany is on heightened alert following wednesday 's announcement that a terrorist attack was being planned for the country .
daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported that the united states had told berlin that between two to four al-qaeda militants were on their way to germany and britain to attempt attacks at the end of november .
among the targets are said to be germany 's popular christmas markets , scheduled to open in the coming days .
security has been stepped up at airports and train stations across the country , and de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere told reporters at a news conference in berlin on wednesday .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
calls for tougher security meanwhile , the head of germany 's police union has criticized the government for not sufficiently preparing the german public for possible terrorist attacks .
in comments made to the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt , konrad freiberg said on thursday that there were " serious security deficits , " and that " everything humanly possible " must be done " to protect the public from risk . "
in the wake of the wednesday 's announcement , government officials on thursday also called for a tougher security laws . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are baffled as to how the device made it aboard hans-peter uhl , of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , called for an increased focus on public surveillance and the monitoring of telecommunications and data collection .
" only the intelligence services can help us identify terrorist threats early enough , " he told the daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger on thursday .
he said it was " completely unthinkable " that the public could be protected without data collection .
earlier this year , the federal constitutional court ruled that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data for up to six months was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
since march , the storage of such data has been outlawed , though certain government ministers have pushed for an early review of the decision .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , sees no need for tougher laws .
" the new threats are no reason for legislative changes , " he told the neuen osnabruecker zeitung newspaper , instead calling for calm and increased watchfulness .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .
however , in germany and everywhere else , the company also allows people to report abuse , or inaccuracies , or request that something be blurred using an online tool .
" our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences , " flesicher added .
" we try to anticipate them .
we 're all internationally-minded people ourselves .
we try to guess how people will react to them .
but a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before , so we learn and we adapt as we go along . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street level photographs for smaller german cities and towns is also on the way street view expansion continues the california company certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany .
over the last two years , it has already taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .
google has also already sent street view vehicles to other european countries , including latvia and estonia .
germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 18.11.2010 european airlines flout passenger rights , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are being denied their rights a new report from germany 's consumer protection body says that european airlines are flouting eu regulations on ‘ passenger rights . '
this is unsurprising , considering the cut-throat price war in the air travel market . it may be the first time that air-rage has manifested itself as a communal sit-in .
a tense stand-off ensued tuesday night when around 90 passengers returning from morocco to paris refused to disembark from a ryanair flight that had landed three hours late – at liege airport in belgium .
there was a good explanation for the detour – fog had made a safe landing impossible at beauvais airport north of paris – but for over four hours passengers refused to travel the last 350 kilometers -lrb- 225 miles -rrb- on the buses provided by ryanair .
reports said the crew reacted by turning off the lights , locking the toilets and leaving the aircraft , but ryanair denied that version of events , whicle a spokesman for liege airport described the atmosphere as " really tense " and referred to " a few acts of violence " by the passengers .
whether this exceptionally angry protest was justified is open to question , but it marks a new low in relations between airlines and passengers .
coincidentally , it also comes in the same week that the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- released a damning survey of german customer satisfaction in the airline industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprisingly , there were fewer complaints about budget airlines the key conclusion of the survey was that the ' airline passenger rights ' introduced by the european union five years ago are often being ignored .
flouting the new rules the eu directive was designed to guarantee airline passengers compensation for cancelled or delayed flights , but many national governments have yet to devise the institutions that enforce these rules .
the vzbv 's survey - comprising 1,122 questionnaires - found that 80 percent of people were only informed of flight delays at the airport .
the report also said that only 25 percent were offered compensation or other services stipulated by the regulations , and then almost always only after having demanded it .
over half of those surveyed also said that they were not made aware of their passenger rights before their journey – another one of the eu 's stipulations .
according to vzbv lawyer sabine fischer-volk , it was n't just the budget airlines that failed to provide the service .
" more or less all airlines have been ignoring the passengers ' rights , " she told deutsche welle .
" we got the most complaints about lufthansa , condor , and air berlin – the high-end airlines . "
the survey should not be taken as a ratings table for airlines themselves , since those questioned flew mainly with airlines that operate in germany .
but the vzbv say their data shows a significant flouting of the rules by the airline industry in general .
good reasons apart from the problem of inadequate enforcement , fischer-volk pointed out the obvious economic reasons for the airline 's policy .
unlike the compensation offered by german rail operator deutsche bahn , for example , the eu-stipulated compensation is not tied to the cost of the flight tickets , but by the distance of the journey , and it is always between 250 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 338 - $ 810 -rrb- per passenger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister is in the middle of setting up a new arbitration committee " if you calculate that for a fully-booked airplane , that comes to roughly four times the cost of the flight , " said fischer-volk .
" and of course the airlines are going to do all they can to avoid paying that . "
the compensation payments are the same for budget airlines and high-end airlines , but since the high-end airlines have been losing passengers to the budget airlines , they are under considerable pressure to protect their profit margins .
arbitration committee in the works the vzbv also reported that airlines often systematically deprived passengers of their rights by delaying letters , while fines imposed by german authorities like the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- were not intimidating enough .
in an interview with financial daily handelsblatt , the chairman of the berlin branch of the vzbv , juergen kessler , said that by its nature the lba " is closer to the industry than it is to the consumers . "
this is a key reason why a new arbitration committee is needed .
" the lba is not an arbitrative body in the sense the eu requires , but a managing body that imposes fines , but does not make rulings , " said fischer-volk .
" that means that the only recourse for passengers not compensated by airlines is a civil court .
that is of course very cumbersome and very expensive , and it clogs courts with thousands of cases . "
the german government is currently in the process of setting up a new independent body , and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger recently told the tagesspiegel newspaper that " constructive " negotiations for were in progress .
" that would be a decisive step towards a proper arbitration committee , " said fischer-volk .
" of course the final step would be that if there was a legitimate claim the airlines would regulate themselves .
then we would n't need the committee . "

as the possibility of a permanent division looms , the european green party is making its own efforts to restart the reunification process . united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon hosts the leadership of the greek and turkish cypriots on thursday in what is being described as a final effort by the un to revitalize reunification talks .
greek cypriot president dimitris christofias and dervis eroglu , president of the de facto turkish republic of northern cyprus , are to meet with ban in new york .
the un 's cyprus envoy , alexander downer , said the secretary-general " wants to hear face-to-face with the leaders their perspective of how the talks are going and what the prospects are . "
eighteen months of un-sponsored talks have ground to a virtual halt amid mutual recriminations .
there are growing signs that these talks could be the last and that the island 's partition could become essentially permanent - something that has the potential to scupper turkey 's efforts to join the european union .
eu intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cohn-bendit says ending the eu 's embargo could be a new impetus for reunification the european green party held talks in istanbul earlier this month , taking the opportunity to build support for its efforts to break the current stalemate in cyprus .
the party has proposed an end to the eu 's economic embargo against the turkish north as a first step in restarting reunification talks .
" the opening of north cyprus , of the ports and airports , is a question of trade , " said party co-chair daniel cohn-bendit .
" it 's a majority decision , so one nation can not block it .
so we are for the opening the ports and airports in northern cyprus .
then turkey will open its ports and airports for the greek cypriots . "
the initiative has been made possible under the lisbon treaty , which came into force last year and removed the right of eu member states to veto certain initiatives , including those related to trade .
until now the internationally recognized greek cypriot government has used its veto to stop any move to ease the trade restrictions on the north .
turkish military presence during his visit to istanbul , cohn-bendit met with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
he said the un 's cyprus talks needed fresh impetus , and that if the greens are successful in lifting the embargo it will open the door to concessions from turkey .
turkey is believed to have more than 40,000 soldiers on the turkish side of the island , and their removal remains a major stumbling block to reunification talks .
" we want turkey to say if trade is open with north cyprus , they will start to reduce the number of soldiers in north cyprus , " said cohn-bendit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey lends substantial military support to turkish northern cyprus support for reunification divided the greek cypriots are lobbying hard against any attempt to remove their veto over an end to the embargo , arguing that it is crucial to put pressure on the turkish cypriots to agree to reunification .
but the possibility of a permanent division of cyprus may lend support to the greens ' initiative .
ankara claims brussels had promised to end the embargo after the turkish cypriots in 2004 voted in a referendum to support a un-sponsored reunification plan , while greek cypriots voted against it .
turkey says it will not open its airports and ports to the greek cypriots until the embargo is lifted , and last week turkish eu affairs minister egemen bagis ruled out any new concessions over cyprus .
" by now turkey and turkish cypriots have proven time and time again that they believe in a solution and that they believe in a settlement , " he said .
" it 's now up to the greek cypriots to prove that they really do believe in a solution - a comprehensive settlement . "

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

" the new volunteer service is an invitation for people of all ages to serve the community , " german family minister kristina schroeder said in a statement .

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet : the eurozone is in great need of governance speaking at a central banking conference in frankfurt , jean-claude trichet bemoaned the weakening of the stability and growth pact - which seeks to limit the budget deficits of eu member states to 3 percent of gdp - and called for " quantum leap " in economic governance in an " exceptionally demanding and uncertain " environment .
as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 18.11.2010 european airlines flout passenger rights , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are being denied their rights a new report from germany 's consumer protection body says that european airlines are flouting eu regulations on ‘ passenger rights . '
this is unsurprising , considering the cut-throat price war in the air travel market . it may be the first time that air-rage has manifested itself as a communal sit-in .
a tense stand-off ensued tuesday night when around 90 passengers returning from morocco to paris refused to disembark from a ryanair flight that had landed three hours late – at liege airport in belgium .
there was a good explanation for the detour – fog had made a safe landing impossible at beauvais airport north of paris – but for over four hours passengers refused to travel the last 350 kilometers -lrb- 225 miles -rrb- on the buses provided by ryanair .
reports said the crew reacted by turning off the lights , locking the toilets and leaving the aircraft , but ryanair denied that version of events , whicle a spokesman for liege airport described the atmosphere as " really tense " and referred to " a few acts of violence " by the passengers .
whether this exceptionally angry protest was justified is open to question , but it marks a new low in relations between airlines and passengers .
coincidentally , it also comes in the same week that the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- released a damning survey of german customer satisfaction in the airline industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprisingly , there were fewer complaints about budget airlines the key conclusion of the survey was that the ' airline passenger rights ' introduced by the european union five years ago are often being ignored .
flouting the new rules the eu directive was designed to guarantee airline passengers compensation for cancelled or delayed flights , but many national governments have yet to devise the institutions that enforce these rules .
the vzbv 's survey - comprising 1,122 questionnaires - found that 80 percent of people were only informed of flight delays at the airport .
the report also said that only 25 percent were offered compensation or other services stipulated by the regulations , and then almost always only after having demanded it .
over half of those surveyed also said that they were not made aware of their passenger rights before their journey – another one of the eu 's stipulations .
according to vzbv lawyer sabine fischer-volk , it was n't just the budget airlines that failed to provide the service .
" more or less all airlines have been ignoring the passengers ' rights , " she told deutsche welle .
" we got the most complaints about lufthansa , condor , and air berlin – the high-end airlines . "
the survey should not be taken as a ratings table for airlines themselves , since those questioned flew mainly with airlines that operate in germany .
but the vzbv say their data shows a significant flouting of the rules by the airline industry in general .
good reasons apart from the problem of inadequate enforcement , fischer-volk pointed out the obvious economic reasons for the airline 's policy .
unlike the compensation offered by german rail operator deutsche bahn , for example , the eu-stipulated compensation is not tied to the cost of the flight tickets , but by the distance of the journey , and it is always between 250 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 338 - $ 810 -rrb- per passenger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister is in the middle of setting up a new arbitration committee " if you calculate that for a fully-booked airplane , that comes to roughly four times the cost of the flight , " said fischer-volk .
" and of course the airlines are going to do all they can to avoid paying that . "
the compensation payments are the same for budget airlines and high-end airlines , but since the high-end airlines have been losing passengers to the budget airlines , they are under considerable pressure to protect their profit margins .
arbitration committee in the works the vzbv also reported that airlines often systematically deprived passengers of their rights by delaying letters , while fines imposed by german authorities like the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- were not intimidating enough .
in an interview with financial daily handelsblatt , the chairman of the berlin branch of the vzbv , juergen kessler , said that by its nature the lba " is closer to the industry than it is to the consumers . "
this is a key reason why a new arbitration committee is needed .
" the lba is not an arbitrative body in the sense the eu requires , but a managing body that imposes fines , but does not make rulings , " said fischer-volk .
" that means that the only recourse for passengers not compensated by airlines is a civil court .
that is of course very cumbersome and very expensive , and it clogs courts with thousands of cases . "
the german government is currently in the process of setting up a new independent body , and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger recently told the tagesspiegel newspaper that " constructive " negotiations for were in progress .
" that would be a decisive step towards a proper arbitration committee , " said fischer-volk .

on the same day , in namibia , a suspected bomb was found on a plane headed for munich . the german government has urged citizens to remain calm and not to let the recent terror alerts affect their daily lives , according to a communique issued at a meeting of the interior ministers of the country 's 16 federal states .
" international terrorism aims to spread fear in our country .
this we will not allow , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at the gathering in the northern city of hamburg .
" we ask all citizens to continue living their lives as before , without fear , in peaceful cooperation with one another and heightened vigilance for one another . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' the talks came on the same day namibian police at windhoek airport intercepted a suspected bomb with a detonator and running clock on an air berlin plane bound for munich .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- said on thursday that the device was found inside a laptop case wrapped in plastic , adding that investigations were ongoing as to whether the explosive would detonate .
germany is on heightened alert following wednesday 's announcement that a terrorist attack was being planned for the country .
daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported that the united states had told berlin that between two to four al-qaeda militants were on their way to germany and britain to attempt attacks at the end of november .
among the targets are said to be germany 's popular christmas markets , scheduled to open in the coming days .
security has been stepped up at airports and train stations across the country , and de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere told reporters at a news conference in berlin on wednesday .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
calls for tougher security meanwhile , the head of germany 's police union has criticized the government for not sufficiently preparing the german public for possible terrorist attacks .
in comments made to the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt , konrad freiberg said on thursday that there were " serious security deficits , " and that " everything humanly possible " must be done " to protect the public from risk . "
in the wake of the wednesday 's announcement , government officials on thursday also called for a tougher security laws . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are baffled as to how the device made it aboard hans-peter uhl , of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , called for an increased focus on public surveillance and the monitoring of telecommunications and data collection .
" only the intelligence services can help us identify terrorist threats early enough , " he told the daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger on thursday .
he said it was " completely unthinkable " that the public could be protected without data collection .
earlier this year , the federal constitutional court ruled that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data for up to six months was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
since march , the storage of such data has been outlawed , though certain government ministers have pushed for an early review of the decision .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , sees no need for tougher laws .
" the new threats are no reason for legislative changes , " he told the neuen osnabruecker zeitung newspaper , instead calling for calm and increased watchfulness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.11.2010 britain , germany have vested interest in saving ireland from debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish state has invested heavily in bank bailouts global markets are abuzz with speculation that ireland will become the eurozone 's next state to need a bailout .
those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 18.11.2010 nokia siemens lawsuit dropped by iranian plaintiffs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians accused nokia siemens of helping the regime two iranian plaintiffs had filed a case against nokia siemens in american federal court , where they had alleged that the sale of telecommunications surveillance technology to iran had resulted in arrest and torture . last wednesday , the attorney for two iranians who had sued nokia siemens networks in an american federal court withdrew their lawsuit .
in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia siemens networks has said that it is no longer involved in iran nokia siemens networks denies responsibility in response to the withdrawl , the company posted a statement to its website that the company " can not and should not be held responsible for the alleged actions of the iranian authorities . "
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

the government should do more to support cultural education at a young age , he says . deutsche welle : mr hoffmann , do you think there are enough museums , community cinemas and other similar cultural institutions in germany , or is there room for improvement ? hilmar hoffmann : there is definitely room for improvement .
it 's always only the big cities which have an extensive collection of museums - like berlin , hamburg , munich , stuttgart or frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar hoffmann would like to see culture mentioned in the german constitution but think about the people in the countryside , which is a large majority of the population .
they did n't grow up with equal opportunity because they never had the chance to take advantage of cultural institutions . " culture for everyone " was your maxim during your time as head of the goethe-institut .
now that you are retired , how do you view the slogan " culture for everyone " in light of your current reality ? statistically speaking , culture for everyone is still a work in progress .
i would say that more than 15 percent of the population does not regularly participate in cultural events .
that 's why it 's important for schools to make aesthetic development and musical training part of their curriculum , so that every young person has the opportunity to grow up with equal opportunities and become a participant in the cultural offerings that they are paying for with their tax money . where do you see the biggest deficits ?
is it the schools that do n't see it as a priority , or is there just not enough money from the state ? i would say , the deficit can be found in politics , which has failed to bring about the necessary changes in the school curriculum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultural development should start young , says hoffmann here in the state of hesse , for example , we had a culture commission with great partners , and , in our concluding report , we stated that the ministry of culture and the ministry of education finally had to start working together to start providing cultural education in schools .
and that 's true not just for hesse but for all the states .
and as long as those are competing ministries - competing as far as funding goes - things wo n't change . you mentioned politics .
there has also been an ongoing discussion about making culture national policy - something which you have advocated .
why is that ? because all kinds of special interests are secured in the constitution .
sport , for example , is considered a basic right .
why not culture ?
on the other hand , it is stated in the constitution that we are a kulturstaat -lrb- cultural state -rrb- .
that 's why it is the state 's job to ensure the opportunity for cultural development from the very beginning of our individuation - that is , in pre-school . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense and foreign ministers from the 28-nation military alliance gathered last month in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy , designed to replace the last one agreed upon in 1999 , and to usher in a new era for the organization .
the new strategic concept , expected to be approved in lisbon later this week , may include measures to protect against cyberterrorism and chemical weapons - threats that were not nearly as prevalent a decade ago .
new challenges " it just means we will have different types of troops , " freudenstein said .
" they must be equipped with modern communication devices .
they must be light .
they must be easily transferable .
and it must be a professional army . "
a key element expected to be added to nato 's strategy at lisbon is a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america from attack .
" i would expect the summit to make a decision on missile defense , which would be a very visible demonstration of our preparedness to improve our capabilities even during a period of economic austerity , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said at last month 's nato meeting .
missle defense shield although german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called the plan " basically a good idea , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle wants to focus on a different priority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's new mission must account for 21st century threats last week he reiterated his demand for a full withdrawal of all nuclear weapons stored in germany .
" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate in berlin .
the foreign minister said disarmament would be a key issue in lisbon .
but germany appears to be standing alone with its desire to link missile defense and nuclear disarmament .
france maintains that nuclear deterrence is still necessary in the 21st century , and us secretary of defense robert gates also expressed doubt last month that giving it up was a viable option .
" i did n't hear anything about linkage in terms of missile defense and nuclear reductions , " he said after last month 's nato meeting of foreign and defense ministers in brussels .
so far it seems that the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons , like the one us president barack obama once described , is bound to remain an elusive goal with little direct impact on the new nato strategy .

last night about 2.5 million pilgrims spent their night here in tents .
the symbolic stoning of the devil ends today – and so does the hajj .
i look at the kaaba one more time and almost feel a bit sad .
today , pilgrims will circle the kaaba seven times - and then it 's all over .
however , i 'll stay a little longer .
i will visit the city of jiddah and tell you about my experiences there . looking at the kaaba , a question by dw user " serubogo " comes to my mind .
he wondered whether islamic tradition says that heaven 's gate is located above the kaaba – and whether there 's even a non-fly zone around mecca for that reason . well , i 've never heard anything about that .
i asked some of the pilgrims , and they had n't heard about it either .
so i guess it 's another example of the fact that religious teachings and local or regional customs merge from time to time – in islam as well as in other religions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female pilgrims get a ride to the next stage of the hajj but even if there was a no-fly zone here , then it definitely does n't apply to helicopters !
because one can see them hovering above around the clock here , monitoring the pilgrimage and supporting the police and paramedics . still , as in previous years some pilgrims died during the hajj , but the numbers were apparently lower than earlier .
until now the authorities either could n't or didn ’ t want to give me any concrete figures . but apparently most of the deaths were related to traffic accidents .
unlike earlier , there were no mass panics as the security measures were improved significantly .
dw user nasyr muhammad is probably not the only one who was interested in this piece of information . susan 's dangerous assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taken from a helicopter - unfortunately not from susan susan baaghil has a vivid recollection of the events of 1997 when hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the chaos of that year ’ s hajj .
susan is considered saudi arabia ’ s first female press photographer .
she documented the catastrophe aboard a helicopter with its doors open .
" these assignments are dangerous , " she says .
" but being a photographer is my calling . " like me , susan , who is fluent in four languages , originally hails from yemen .
there are n't all that many female photographers in saudi arabia , but she says she feels accepted by her male colleagues .
by the way , she 's not only working for the reuters news agency – but also as a wedding photographer .
" the first thing i saw after i was born was n't my mother , but her camera ” , she says with a smile . poor and rich pilgrims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim pilgrims pray on the side of a street as a press photographer , susan has very high standards .
she does n't want to snap only the usual pictures of the huge crowds of pilgrims one often gets from the event .
instead she also wants to cover the places the saudi authorities are less keen for the world to see : like the tent cities of " illegal " pilgrims who came here without a visa or an official permit . most of them are poor people from saudi arabia and other countries who simply ca n't afford the costs of the hajj .
" my pictures are supposed to reveal how difficult it is for these people , " explains susan .
" my goal is that people feel for these poor pilgrims and perhaps help them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims stoning the devil at jamarat bridge in these tent cities the garbage is piling up : plastic bags , empty boxes , left over food that is left to rot - the stench is at times so bad that some pilgrims only walk around with their masks on .
there are simply far too few trash cans and many people are afraid of the spread of diseases . at the same time , there are quite a number of very affluent pilgrims .
i met a man who was given 7,000 euros from his mother to make sure he would have a comfortable hajj and could spend his nights in a luxury hotel .
that leads me to the question of dw user hayman said who asked how pilgrims spend their money during the hajj .
well , i don ’ t know how it is all spent in detail .
but i would guess that the hotels here are probably doing really well . consulting a doctor is free by the way , i am also living in a hotel here .
it 's a room with eight beds which i share it with pilgrims form lebanon , syria , and yemen .
last night we were really cold , because we had turned the air conditioner down too low – our own fault .
so today , i feel like a caught a little cold .
and my knee hurts too , so i ’ ll go see the pilgrimage physician . while i really miss germany , i like the fact that going to the hospital is free and totally unbureaucratic here .
i see a saudi physician called muhammad ali khalifa who studied in austria twenty years ago and still raves about the country and the people .
in a friendly tone , he reprimands me for having missed some vaccinations .
" is that a problem ? "
i ask him , a bit worried .
" no , " he replies .
" that ’ s okay .
there 's no danger of swine flu or meningitis during the hajj season . " thank god ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization 's present model , established in 1999 , was crafted before al qaeda , cyber warfare and piracy posed security threats . the north atlantic treaty organization could be on its way to adopting sweeping reforms , as nato leaders prepare to meet in lisbon on friday .
there is broad agreement among political analysts that the organization is in need of a new strategic concept in light of present-day threats that greatly differ from the challenges of the cold war era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security challenges have changed drastically in the last decade " nato is , in principle , still equipped for a conventional war ; to repel an attack on its territory , " said security expert roland freudenstein of the center for european studies in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 18.11.2010 msf wants eu 's ' hands off ' life-saving generic drugs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a proposed trade deal could spell death for many of india 's generic drug customers as the european union and india try to reach a free-trade agreement , the humanitarian group doctors without borders is concerned .
it 's afraid the deal could limit access to affordable generic drugs it relies on . the humanitarian organization doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- sources 80 percent of the anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- it uses to treat hiv / aids in the developing world from india .
india has become known as " the pharmacy of the developing world " for producing affordable , generic drugs .
but some activists warn that a proposed free-trade agreement between the european union and india could lead to tougher intellectual property regulations that could hamper access to cheap , generic indian medicines .
msf recently launched the ' europe !
hands off our medicine ' campaign to pressure the 27-member bloc into halting measures it says would substantially restrict access to inexpensive medicines for people in developing countries .
last week , in an open letter to european trade commissioner karel de gucht , msf warned that if the european commission pursues the trade deal " people who rely on these medicines to stay alive will be left without a lifeline and many are likely to die . "
deutsche welle talked to msf 's international president , dr. unni karunakara , about the campaign , as eu-india negotiations on the proposed free-trade agreement progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. unni karunakara heads doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- and opposes the trade deal deutsche welle : msf has accused the eu of trying to " shut off the tap of affordable medicines . "
why is india so important in the context of generic drugs globally ?
dr. unni karunakara : we have 160,000 hiv / aids patients now on treatment in africa alone , and 80 percent of the drugs that we use to treat our patients come from india .
so india is for us the pharmacy of the world .
this is where the drugs come from that allow us to treat so many patients .
it is very important that this space exists in india for us to be able to continue to produce generic medications and our ability to actually use them as well .
the other concern is that increasingly the industry and other governments are characterizing generic drugs as counterfeit drugs .
that 's absolutely not the case .
generic drugs work as well as branded drugs , it 's just that they are not made by a company .
characterising generic drugs as fake , counterfeit or substandard is actually doing a disservice , and it 's going to affect our ability to treat patients in africa big time .
and that 's why we are concerned , and that 's why we have launched this campaign .
the campaign slogan leaves little doubt that you 're suggesting interference by europe in the production and distribution of various life-saving drugs .
but can msf and others push their argument forward using a rights perspective ?
i think the big victory in the doha rounds was that intellectual property rights are in opposition to large public health concerns ; the government has the right to overturn the pattern .
i think we need to keep that ; we ca n't afford to lose that .
what governments are trying to do is to enter into bilateral agreements to undermine this sort of international agreement -lsb- doha declaration -rsb- and , by underhand methods , trying to again shut down the production of generics .
for us this is a huge problem .
europe and other western governments are trying to bind india to a deal that will hit the production of generics and you say deprive millions of patients of affordable drugs .
how can countries that are often seen as benign donors justify this ?
i think it 's a question of " does the right hand know what the left hand is doing . "
i think there are different parts of the government or different parts of the european union that are engaged in negotiations .
the european commission humanitarian aid and civil protection , as we know , is trying to promote humanitarian action , has a large amount of funding for humanitarian work that is going on .
at the same time , the trade and commerce people are , of course , interested in protecting their interests , whether it 's in europe or in america .
i think sometimes these things come in to competition , and we are relying on the good will of the public to tell their politicians what matters most .
we 've had great successes in the past , and we hope that this campaign will also help get our concerns heard , and that the citizens will also express their opinion on this matter , and force their governments to back down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. karunakara urges india to realize the impact of its drug industry on global health based on developments so far , is it realistic to expect that the two sides can modify the proposed eu-india free-trade agreement enough to dispel your concerns ?
we always put the pressure on the european governments ; i think the indian government also needs to live up to its role as an aspiring superpower .
i do n't think many people in india fully realize the impact of the indian drug industry on the lives of people outside india .
and i think this is something they need to know .
they need to know that they are serving a larger purpose .
the government needs to take a firm stand and it can do it .
i 'm personally hopeful that the negotiations will go in the right direction .
i think india should step up to addressing this problem and consider the lives of so many - 4 million people on treatment in africa alone - and that is not just msf but all patients , and many of them rely on indian drugs .
msf also claims that the european commission is attacking not only the production of generic medicines , but also their registration , transportation and export .
as far as i understand , any drug that passes through a european port , the consignment can be confiscated and even destroyed .
so that 's also a very important part of the problem .
we want the eu to not enforce this very arbitrary kind of decision that they have made .
msf has said the eu-india deal is only a fraction of the attacks on the generic medicine industry .
where else are the obstacles being placed and what kind of an impact are they going to have ?
the us and the pharmaceutical industry are right now in india , challenging patents that are being granted by the indian government or trying to gain patents for certain drugs which the indian government has deemed not worthy of patent .
the efforts are going on in many different forums , so i think this is a multi-pronged attack from the industry and governments to address this issue once and for all .
and we just ca n't let that happen .
apart from the hiv / aids medicines you are distributing , what other diseases and health conditions are we talking about when we refer to generics from india ?
as far as other diseases are concerned , a lot of those we treat - neglected tropical diseases like sleeping sickness -lsb- which is endemic to sub-saharan africa -rsb- , -lsb- the tropical parasitic -rsb- chagas disease - by and large a lot of diseases that are being treated by drugs that have been in existence for a long time and there are no patent issues there .
in the future , of course , our ability to get new forms of antibiotics or to be able to treat hyper-tension with new classes of drugs or our ability to treat diabetes , i think they all will be affected by the kind of decisions governments are making today .

'
this is unsurprising , considering the cut-throat price war in the air travel market . it may be the first time that air-rage has manifested itself as a communal sit-in .
a tense stand-off ensued tuesday night when around 90 passengers returning from morocco to paris refused to disembark from a ryanair flight that had landed three hours late – at liege airport in belgium .
there was a good explanation for the detour – fog had made a safe landing impossible at beauvais airport north of paris – but for over four hours passengers refused to travel the last 350 kilometers -lrb- 225 miles -rrb- on the buses provided by ryanair .
reports said the crew reacted by turning off the lights , locking the toilets and leaving the aircraft , but ryanair denied that version of events , whicle a spokesman for liege airport described the atmosphere as " really tense " and referred to " a few acts of violence " by the passengers .
whether this exceptionally angry protest was justified is open to question , but it marks a new low in relations between airlines and passengers .
coincidentally , it also comes in the same week that the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- released a damning survey of german customer satisfaction in the airline industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprisingly , there were fewer complaints about budget airlines the key conclusion of the survey was that the ' airline passenger rights ' introduced by the european union five years ago are often being ignored .
flouting the new rules the eu directive was designed to guarantee airline passengers compensation for cancelled or delayed flights , but many national governments have yet to devise the institutions that enforce these rules .
the vzbv 's survey - comprising 1,122 questionnaires - found that 80 percent of people were only informed of flight delays at the airport .
the report also said that only 25 percent were offered compensation or other services stipulated by the regulations , and then almost always only after having demanded it .
over half of those surveyed also said that they were not made aware of their passenger rights before their journey – another one of the eu 's stipulations .
according to vzbv lawyer sabine fischer-volk , it was n't just the budget airlines that failed to provide the service .
" more or less all airlines have been ignoring the passengers ' rights , " she told deutsche welle .
" we got the most complaints about lufthansa , condor , and air berlin – the high-end airlines . "
the survey should not be taken as a ratings table for airlines themselves , since those questioned flew mainly with airlines that operate in germany .
but the vzbv say their data shows a significant flouting of the rules by the airline industry in general .
good reasons apart from the problem of inadequate enforcement , fischer-volk pointed out the obvious economic reasons for the airline 's policy .
unlike the compensation offered by german rail operator deutsche bahn , for example , the eu-stipulated compensation is not tied to the cost of the flight tickets , but by the distance of the journey , and it is always between 250 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 338 - $ 810 -rrb- per passenger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister is in the middle of setting up a new arbitration committee " if you calculate that for a fully-booked airplane , that comes to roughly four times the cost of the flight , " said fischer-volk .
" and of course the airlines are going to do all they can to avoid paying that . "
the compensation payments are the same for budget airlines and high-end airlines , but since the high-end airlines have been losing passengers to the budget airlines , they are under considerable pressure to protect their profit margins .
arbitration committee in the works the vzbv also reported that airlines often systematically deprived passengers of their rights by delaying letters , while fines imposed by german authorities like the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- were not intimidating enough .
in an interview with financial daily handelsblatt , the chairman of the berlin branch of the vzbv , juergen kessler , said that by its nature the lba " is closer to the industry than it is to the consumers . "
this is a key reason why a new arbitration committee is needed .
" the lba is not an arbitrative body in the sense the eu requires , but a managing body that imposes fines , but does not make rulings , " said fischer-volk .
" that means that the only recourse for passengers not compensated by airlines is a civil court .
that is of course very cumbersome and very expensive , and it clogs courts with thousands of cases . "
the german government is currently in the process of setting up a new independent body , and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger recently told the tagesspiegel newspaper that " constructive " negotiations for were in progress .
" that would be a decisive step towards a proper arbitration committee , " said fischer-volk .
" of course the final step would be that if there was a legitimate claim the airlines would regulate themselves .
then we would n't need the committee . "

the french constitutional court was ordered on tuesday to decide if the law banning marriage for same-sex couples is compatible with the country 's constitution .
gay rights campaigners in the country say this means gay marriage could be legalized as early as next year .
the case began with a lesbian couple living in champagne that wanted to get married and thought it was unfair that they are not allowed to under french law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court of cassation said gay marriage was ' the subject of broad debate ' this summer a court in the champagne city of reims said the court of cassation - roughly equivalent to a supreme court - should decide the issue .
that court has referred the case to the constitutional court to rule on the matter , noting that same-sex marriage " is today the subject of a broad debate within society , notably because of the evolution of morals and the recognition of same-sex marriages by the laws of several foreign countries . "
france ' lagging behind ' on human rights this court has the power to over-turn legislation , and emmanuel ludo , the lawyer representing the champagne couple , said he is confident it will do so .
he said refusing the right to marry to same-sex couples amounts to the denial of an individual freedom .
" france is lagging behind certain european countries and certain other countries in the world - notably in latin america , " ludo told rtl radio .
" france is a country that respects human rights and yet we are lagging behind when it comes to gay marriage .
it is high time we caught up . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludo said france lags behind latin america , as argentina has legalized gay marriage laurence weber , president of an association called execo , or equal , said overturning the gay marriage ban would put an end to a form of discrimination .
" this would allow us , first of all , to abolish the sexuality hierarchy and to put an end to the idea that heterosexuality is superior , " weber said .
" that 's the principle of the thing .
but legalizing gay marriage would also make life a lot easier for many gay couples on a practical level . "
margins of society sophie aslawhere is one of the two mothers who are demanding the legalization of same-sex marriage .
she has been living with her partner for 15 years and the two of them have been bringing up four children together .
aslawhere said allowing her and her partner to marry would give their relationship the status it currently lacks in other people 's eyes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries offer some form of legal recognition for same-sex couples " our children are fed up of being treated as though they are on the margins of society , " she said .
" for example a few years ago when they held elections at our children 's school for a new parents ' organization , they did n't accept my partner 's vote .
that marginalizes our children and that should n't happen . "
same-sex marriage has been legalized by court order or legislation in the netherlands , belgium , spain , portugal , norway , sweden , iceland , south africa , canada and argentina .
many other european countries , including france , have some form of registered partnerships for same-sex couples that offer some or all of the legal rights of marriage .
the constitutional court has three months to make its decision .

on the same day , in namibia , a suspected bomb was found on a plane headed for munich . the german government has urged citizens to remain calm and not to let the recent terror alerts affect their daily lives , according to a communique issued at a meeting of the interior ministers of the country 's 16 federal states .
" international terrorism aims to spread fear in our country .
this we will not allow , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at the gathering in the northern city of hamburg .
" we ask all citizens to continue living their lives as before , without fear , in peaceful cooperation with one another and heightened vigilance for one another . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' the talks came on the same day namibian police at windhoek airport intercepted a suspected bomb with a detonator and running clock on an air berlin plane bound for munich .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- said on thursday that the device was found inside a laptop case wrapped in plastic , adding that investigations were ongoing as to whether the explosive would detonate .
germany is on heightened alert following wednesday 's announcement that a terrorist attack was being planned for the country .
daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported that the united states had told berlin that between two to four al-qaeda militants were on their way to germany and britain to attempt attacks at the end of november .
among the targets are said to be germany 's popular christmas markets , scheduled to open in the coming days .
security has been stepped up at airports and train stations across the country , and de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere told reporters at a news conference in berlin on wednesday .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
calls for tougher security meanwhile , the head of germany 's police union has criticized the government for not sufficiently preparing the german public for possible terrorist attacks .
in comments made to the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt , konrad freiberg said on thursday that there were " serious security deficits , " and that " everything humanly possible " must be done " to protect the public from risk . "
in the wake of the wednesday 's announcement , government officials on thursday also called for a tougher security laws . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are baffled as to how the device made it aboard hans-peter uhl , of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , called for an increased focus on public surveillance and the monitoring of telecommunications and data collection .
" only the intelligence services can help us identify terrorist threats early enough , " he told the daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger on thursday .
he said it was " completely unthinkable " that the public could be protected without data collection .
earlier this year , the federal constitutional court ruled that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data for up to six months was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
since march , the storage of such data has been outlawed , though certain government ministers have pushed for an early review of the decision .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , sees no need for tougher laws .
" the new threats are no reason for legislative changes , " he told the neuen osnabruecker zeitung newspaper , instead calling for calm and increased watchfulness .

once at a point of virtual extinction , it 's now gaining on france in terms of the number of films currently being produced .
and at this year 's berlin international film festival in february , the golden bear went to turkish director semih kaplanoglu for his film " honey . " within this revival of turkish film , there is now a growing number of women directors - and it 's not only their gender that is making them stand out in the industry .
it 's also the fearlessness of the subjects they are taking on in their films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaplanoglu 's win in berlin thrust the turkish film industry into the limelight questioning family ties stunningly shot in the foreboding mountains of turkey 's black sea , " zephyr " tells the story of a single mother who leaves her young daughter with the girl 's grandparents in order to pursue a career overseas .
it deals with dark , often unspoken issues like abandonment and mortality within the family , as well as questions surrounding love and motherhood . " zephyr " is the first feature film of director belma bas , who says that taboos are a burden to men and women alike . " we really have to break those taboos , to take a step forward to solve really primal problems , which are at the core of very disturbing issues of this country , " bas told deutsche welle .
" we have to start from somewhere .
those mother-child and parent-child relationships are at the core of these things . the film director added that she 's not satisfied with getting a " macro-vision of society , " but that the only way to solve problems is to go deeper and take a closer look . criticism from women the lead female character in " zephyr " is often portrayed in a less-than-positive light , which bas says allowed her to avoid a feminist discourse .
the grandmother character is a voice of conservatism condemning her daughter , who in turn is defended by her father .
it is the nuanced nature of the film that has proved controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bas wants her audience to rethink family relationships at last month 's film festival in antalya , the country 's most prestigious film event , " zephyr " drew condemnation from some female critics for its unsympathetic portrayal of lead female characters . " zephyr " was one of two films by women directors to compete in the main competition , a first for the festival and an indication of the growing number of female directors in turkish film . revitalizing a tradition according to film and media professor tul akbal sualp , women filmmakers are both following a long tradition in turkish culture , and bringing a new cutting edge to turkish cinema . " it is a conservative society , but starting from the late 19th century , if you look at the literature and especially the poetry , we have women characters - strong characters - as often as male ones , " said sualp . these 19th-century works were far more political than those of current generation , sualp said , adding that only recently have the female newcomers to the film scene started approaching social and political problems more so than their predecessors . winning acceptance " merry-go-around , " the second film by director ilksen basarir , deals with a dark taboo : incest .
a first for turkey , the film also participated recently in the antalya film festival . it was the sensitive subject matter , not her gender , that made it difficult to get financing , said basarir , although it has not always been like that . " in turkey in the last five years , the women directors have become stronger , " she said .
" we want to tell our stories to the people and maybe they will start to accept us in this film industry . " early on , she wanted to become a camera assistant , but was told that was out of the question because she would have to carry heavy objects .
" but now things are changing : there are -lsb- female -rsb- lighting assistants , camera assistants , directors - so it 's changed , " said basarir . currently , more than 100 films are in production in turkey .
while the majority of mainstream film directors are still men - as in the rest of the world - that may soon change as well , says bas . " recently , there is no majority of males anymore in documentary- and short-filmmaking in turkey , " she said .
" -lsb- women -rsb- are coming forward to make feature length films as well .

but deutsche welle 's peter stuetzle is convinced it was the right decision to make the announcement . how will people react to the news ?
interior minister thomas de maiziere is n't usually one to propagate fear in order to prepare the ground for tougher security laws , which is why germans find his terror warning particularly disturbing .
will germans avoid soccer stadiums at the weekend ?
will they cancel planned trips or take the car instead of the plane or train in order to evade danger ?
in theory , everyone knows that the risk of dying in a car crash is bigger than falling victim to a terrorist attack .
but driving a car , people still have the feeling that they can control their fate to a certain degree .
at the airport , the train station or in a soccer stadium , however , people feel they are vulnerable , at the mercy of the evil intentions of lurking religious fanatics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the interior minister not have warned the public ?
or should he have left it at his much less concrete appeal two weeks ago , when he said citizens should keep their eyes peeled and inform the police of suspicious goings-on ?
without knowing what de maiziere knows , we can presume that he would have done just that if it had been justifiable .
the indications must be so concrete that he could not leave people in the dark about the dangers .
of course , people noticed the increased police presence at vulnerable sites on wednesday  it was up to the minister to give an explanation .
otherwise , the population might have felt even more intimidated .
criticism voiced by the leader of the opposition greens , juergen trittin , that the interior minister should be more specific , is narrow-minded . he probably ca n't be more specific without endangering the sources for his information .
the public  s safety relies on these sources .
after all , it is thanks to their information channels that intelligence services repeatedly managed to avert planned terrorist attacks over the past few years .
there is reason for optimism that they will succeed again .

last night about 2.5 million pilgrims spent their night here in tents .
the symbolic stoning of the devil ends today – and so does the hajj .
i look at the kaaba one more time and almost feel a bit sad .
today , pilgrims will circle the kaaba seven times - and then it 's all over .
however , i 'll stay a little longer .
i will visit the city of jiddah and tell you about my experiences there . looking at the kaaba , a question by dw user " serubogo " comes to my mind .
he wondered whether islamic tradition says that heaven 's gate is located above the kaaba – and whether there 's even a non-fly zone around mecca for that reason . well , i 've never heard anything about that .
i asked some of the pilgrims , and they had n't heard about it either .
so i guess it 's another example of the fact that religious teachings and local or regional customs merge from time to time – in islam as well as in other religions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female pilgrims get a ride to the next stage of the hajj but even if there was a no-fly zone here , then it definitely does n't apply to helicopters !
because one can see them hovering above around the clock here , monitoring the pilgrimage and supporting the police and paramedics . still , as in previous years some pilgrims died during the hajj , but the numbers were apparently lower than earlier .
until now the authorities either could n't or didn ’ t want to give me any concrete figures . but apparently most of the deaths were related to traffic accidents .
unlike earlier , there were no mass panics as the security measures were improved significantly .
dw user nasyr muhammad is probably not the only one who was interested in this piece of information . susan 's dangerous assignments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taken from a helicopter - unfortunately not from susan susan baaghil has a vivid recollection of the events of 1997 when hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the chaos of that year ’ s hajj .
susan is considered saudi arabia ’ s first female press photographer .
she documented the catastrophe aboard a helicopter with its doors open .
" these assignments are dangerous , " she says .
" but being a photographer is my calling . " like me , susan , who is fluent in four languages , originally hails from yemen .
there are n't all that many female photographers in saudi arabia , but she says she feels accepted by her male colleagues .
by the way , she 's not only working for the reuters news agency – but also as a wedding photographer .
" the first thing i saw after i was born was n't my mother , but her camera ” , she says with a smile . poor and rich pilgrims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim pilgrims pray on the side of a street as a press photographer , susan has very high standards .
she does n't want to snap only the usual pictures of the huge crowds of pilgrims one often gets from the event .
instead she also wants to cover the places the saudi authorities are less keen for the world to see : like the tent cities of " illegal " pilgrims who came here without a visa or an official permit . most of them are poor people from saudi arabia and other countries who simply ca n't afford the costs of the hajj .
" my pictures are supposed to reveal how difficult it is for these people , " explains susan .
" my goal is that people feel for these poor pilgrims and perhaps help them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims stoning the devil at jamarat bridge in these tent cities the garbage is piling up : plastic bags , empty boxes , left over food that is left to rot - the stench is at times so bad that some pilgrims only walk around with their masks on .
there are simply far too few trash cans and many people are afraid of the spread of diseases . at the same time , there are quite a number of very affluent pilgrims .
i met a man who was given 7,000 euros from his mother to make sure he would have a comfortable hajj and could spend his nights in a luxury hotel .
that leads me to the question of dw user hayman said who asked how pilgrims spend their money during the hajj .
well , i don ’ t know how it is all spent in detail .
but i would guess that the hotels here are probably doing really well . consulting a doctor is free by the way , i am also living in a hotel here .
it 's a room with eight beds which i share it with pilgrims form lebanon , syria , and yemen .
last night we were really cold , because we had turned the air conditioner down too low – our own fault .
so today , i feel like a caught a little cold .
and my knee hurts too , so i ’ ll go see the pilgrimage physician . while i really miss germany , i like the fact that going to the hospital is free and totally unbureaucratic here .
i see a saudi physician called muhammad ali khalifa who studied in austria twenty years ago and still raves about the country and the people .
in a friendly tone , he reprimands me for having missed some vaccinations .
" is that a problem ? "
i ask him , a bit worried .
" no , " he replies .
" that ’ s okay .
there 's no danger of swine flu or meningitis during the hajj season . " thank god ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .
despite a negative reaction from the international community , no one in the osce has said that they are uncomfortable with the fact that the country which is hosting the meeting , it is violating the rules .

those who are most entangled in the web of debt may be forced to support such a bailout . as the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund on thursday send representatives to discuss ireland 's potential need for a bailout , several financial institutions across europe and the world await a decision on the worth of their investments in the country .
according to data from the basel-based bank for international settlements , the irish government , banks and companies owe foreign investors $ 731 billion -lrb- 540 billion euros -rrb- .
banks in britain hold the highest stake with $ 149 billion , followed by germany with $ 138 billion , the united states with $ 69 billion , belgium with $ 54 billion and france with $ 50 billion .
should the irish banking system or the government - which has heavily invested in bank bailouts - become unable to pay their creditors , british and german banks would be left with the greatest risk of losses and depreciations .
particularly entangled in the situation are the royal bank of scotland and hypo real estate , each of which had to be nationalized by britain and germany respectively to save them from bankruptcy .
thus by pressing for a bailout for ireland , those countries would be indirectly working in their own financial interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate holds 33 billion euros in debt in the currency 's weakest states web of debt and lending according to numbers from the most recent european union " stress test " of the continent 's biggest banks , hypo real estate loaned 33 billion euros to the weak eurozone member states ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
in comparison , private german banks deutsche bank and commerzbank and the public bank of the state of baden-wuerttemberg loaned between seven and eight billion euros to the same four countries .
all big german banks , public and private , hold a total of $ 400 billion in claims in ireland , greece , portugal and spain .
german banks together thus stand to take a serious hit if the debt crises in these countries comes to a head .
in greece , where the debt crisis has already necessitated a 110-billion euro emergency loan from the eu and the international monetary fund , france is the greatest creditor .
german banks take second place in greece , while they are the greatest stakeholders in spain . all these data from the bank for international settlements show that great britain , germany and france all have a vested interest in the financial stability of ireland , as well as the other problem states of portugal , greece and spain .

on the same day , in namibia , a suspected bomb was found on a plane headed for munich . the german government has urged citizens to remain calm and not to let the recent terror alerts affect their daily lives , according to a communique issued at a meeting of the interior ministers of the country 's 16 federal states .
" international terrorism aims to spread fear in our country .
this we will not allow , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at the gathering in the northern city of hamburg .
" we ask all citizens to continue living their lives as before , without fear , in peaceful cooperation with one another and heightened vigilance for one another . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' the talks came on the same day namibian police at windhoek airport intercepted a suspected bomb with a detonator and running clock on an air berlin plane bound for munich .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- said on thursday that the device was found inside a laptop case wrapped in plastic , adding that investigations were ongoing as to whether the explosive would detonate .
germany is on heightened alert following wednesday 's announcement that a terrorist attack was being planned for the country .
daily newspaper der tagesspiegel reported that the united states had told berlin that between two to four al-qaeda militants were on their way to germany and britain to attempt attacks at the end of november .
among the targets are said to be germany 's popular christmas markets , scheduled to open in the coming days .
security has been stepped up at airports and train stations across the country , and de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere told reporters at a news conference in berlin on wednesday .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
calls for tougher security meanwhile , the head of germany 's police union has criticized the government for not sufficiently preparing the german public for possible terrorist attacks .
in comments made to the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt , konrad freiberg said on thursday that there were " serious security deficits , " and that " everything humanly possible " must be done " to protect the public from risk . "
in the wake of the wednesday 's announcement , government officials on thursday also called for a tougher security laws . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are baffled as to how the device made it aboard hans-peter uhl , of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , called for an increased focus on public surveillance and the monitoring of telecommunications and data collection .
" only the intelligence services can help us identify terrorist threats early enough , " he told the daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger on thursday .
he said it was " completely unthinkable " that the public could be protected without data collection .
earlier this year , the federal constitutional court ruled that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data for up to six months was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
since march , the storage of such data has been outlawed , though certain government ministers have pushed for an early review of the decision .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , sees no need for tougher laws .
" the new threats are no reason for legislative changes , " he told the neuen osnabruecker zeitung newspaper , instead calling for calm and increased watchfulness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 18.11.2010 nokia siemens lawsuit dropped by iranian plaintiffs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians accused nokia siemens of helping the regime two iranian plaintiffs had filed a case against nokia siemens in american federal court , where they had alleged that the sale of telecommunications surveillance technology to iran had resulted in arrest and torture . last wednesday , the attorney for two iranians who had sued nokia siemens networks in an american federal court withdrew their lawsuit .
in the case , the plantiffs isa saharkhiz and mehdi saharkhiz had alleged that the sale of nokia siemens networks mobile phone surveillance technology led to the arrest and torture of isa saharkhiz in iran over a year ago .
" this was purely a legal and strategic decision , " attorney ali herischi told deutsche welle .
herischi is representing the plaintiffs and hopes to bring the case again later .
" the only reason we dropped the case at the moment was to keep it alive and viable , " herischi added .
mehdi saharkhiz has said previously that his father , a well-known iranian journalist , remains in custody .
the son , mehdi , now lives in new jersey in the united states , where he is well-known for being an online iranian human rights activist .
in late june 2009 , in an election widely viewed as fraudulent , mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected as president of iran .
as protests raged in the election 's aftermath , the iranian government cracked down on communications technologies , shutting down mobile phone access and limiting internet access .
in the weeks that followed , it was revealed that nokia siemens networks had sold mobile phone surveillance equipment to iran .
many iranian dissidents blamed the company for aiding a regime that they said was oppressive .
legal case began in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isa saharkhiz remains in prison in iran the father and son team had pursued a legal strategy under the alien tort statute , which allows foreign nationals to sue in american courts for offenses that happened abroad provided that there are violations of american treaty law - in this case , the filing alleges the elder saharkhiz was tortured as a result of nokia siemens ' actions .
" plaintiffs have made their decision in light of recent unsettled court decisions concerning the alien tort claim act , and the continued detention of mr. isa saharkhiz and restrictions placed on him by the iranian government , " wrote ali herischi , in a statement released monday on his firm , moawad & herischi llp 's , website .
" this withdrawal is by no means a confirmation of nokia siemens networks defenses or a relieve of their responsibility , but rather , a reconsideration of the legal environment and isa 's current circumstances .
plaintiffs are hopeful that future developments and easing restrictions on mr. saharkhiz will provide for a better opportunity for isa to hold all those responsible for his arrest , torture and mistreatment accountable . "
but in september , the us second circuit court of appeals ruled in a different case that the alien tort claims act , under which the plaintiffs planned to sue , " does not apply to corporate defendants , " said adam kanzer , an attorney with domini social investments in the united states .
" this is a major setback .
regardless of the withdrawal of this suit , nokia siemens still faces significant human rights risks , " kanzer added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia siemens networks has said that it is no longer involved in iran nokia siemens networks denies responsibility in response to the withdrawl , the company posted a statement to its website that the company " can not and should not be held responsible for the alleged actions of the iranian authorities . "
" we are hopeful that the plaintiffs ' withdrawal of the suit indicates they have reached the same conclusion , " the company continued in the same statement .
" we share a concern for mr. saharkhiz 's welfare and that of dissidents and journalists persecuted for free expression in iran and elsewhere .
accordingly , we call upon all countries to follow due process and provide humane treatment in accordance with their laws and applicable international agreements . "
nokia siemens networks is a joint venture founded in 2006 between the finnish telecom giant nokia and the german corporation siemens .
since the company first came under fire over a year ago , it has argued that it was following the law at the time , and that it is no longer involved in the sale of surveillance equipment to iran .
testifying before a european parliament committee on human rights in june , nokia executive barry french said his company had sold " roughly one third of the deployed capacity " for mobile and data service to two major iranian mobile operators , mci and irancell .
as part of these networks , nokia siemens provided a " lawful interception capability to both operators " and " a related monitoring center to mci . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 18.11.2010 private-army phenomenon exacerbates african conflicts , un says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soldiers from all over the world flock to war zones for pay a working group from the united nations has been visiting south africa this week to investigate the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and discuss ways to enforce legal regulations . africa is a continent that seems to be perpetually at war with itself .
nearly half of its 53 countries are home to an active conflict or a recently ended one .
the causes behind most of the dirty wars raging in nations such as sudan , the democratic republic of the congo -lrb- drc -rrb- and niger have been lost in time ; the soldiers and rebels involved locked in a spiral of violence where killing is the only aim as ideological targets fade into the past .
but where there is little hope , there is considerable profit .
much of africa is a fertile recruiting ground for private mercenaries and security contractors who are willing to do the dirty work for various governments , according to dex torricke-barton from the executive office of the secretary-general at the un in new york .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence led to an upsurge in african conflicts " many ex-military personnel from south africa have offered their services over the last decade and there are also plenty of former european and us troops who are willing to fight , " torricke-barton told deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of these people are contractors , and they perform a wide range of services including providing intelligence , risk assessment , training , and logistics - as well as fighting . "
the well-paid private soldiers often operate with impunity , either under the shield of government command or through the shady subterfuge of multinationals who have hired them to protect their interests .
currently a un working group - its mouthful of an official name is the un working group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - has been visiting south africa this week to investigating the link between african conflicts and international mercenaries , and to discuss ways to enforce legal regulations .
the un has said the growth of unaccountable private armies has exacerbated conflicts in africa .
it has suggested the hired guns are helping to keep the cycle of violence alive in many wars purely to reap financial rewards , while committing atrocities with no fear of prosecution .
legal gray area " there are many problems associated with the growing use of private security contractors in conflict zones , " torricke-barton said .
" governments can rely on these people to avoid taking direct legal responsibility for their conduct , and to commit human-rights abuses which fail to get addressed through the current , weak international legal framework . "
allan cowley , a former british army officer and military analyst , agreed that private soldiers " absolve the governments from any direct responsibility " in the conflicts they 're waging .
" they work in a netherworld , a gray area between legality and criminality , where neither they nor their employers appear accountable for their actions , " he told deutsche welle .
earlier this decade , a golden era for private security firms heralded the rise of companies that have gained western credibility - and sometimes notoriety - through their involvement in government-backed operations in iraq and afghanistan .
and the use of mercenaries has only increased in line with the grudging acceptance of their role in modern warfare .
now the un wants governments in africa to enforce both new and existing laws in an attempt to rein in what many experts says is an exponentially expanding industry .
turning a blind eye " in the post-cold war world , there has been a proliferation of new security challenges in africa , " said torricke-barton .
" governments and conventional military forces have been ill-equipped to deal with these , so they call in independent talent to solve their problems . "
growing interest in africa 's natural resources and the growing presence private firms there has led to an explosion in international investment , points out military analyst cowley . " a blind eye can not see what 's right under its nose , " cowley said .
" just as many of these companies pay little regard to the people and surroundings in which they operate , so they have even less concern about who they employ to protect their businesses , and how these security firms enforce their directives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us security firms are at large in african states a number of african governments signed legislation in 2007 that required private soldiers and security firms to get official authorization to operate in war zones .
however , these laws and older statutes have remained unimplemented by many of the signatories . " there are many national , regional and international legal arrangements which relate to the use of mercenaries .
but all of these legal layers have deficiencies of some form of another , and the legal status of contractors remains fuzzy at best in international law , " said torricke-barton . " most of the work of modern private security contractors falls outside the purview of the 1989 un convention on mercenaries ... a lot more work needs to be done by the international community to adapt the regulatory framework to the 21st century , " he added . private security firms sign up to new code of conduct the un 's efforts to address exactly these problems come just days after a landmark us and british-backed code-of-conduct was implemented by the swiss government and the geneva academy of international humanitarian law . the code will be compulsory for any country using private security operators , and will require companies to meet standards in " recruitment , vetting personnel , training , control mechanisms , compliance with local and international laws and protection of human rights . " the code also imposes limits on the use of force and an assurance that staff can not invoke contractual obligations or " superior orders " in a conflict zone to justify crimes , killings , torture , kidnappings and detentions .
the aim is to prevent abuse and rein in excessive violence in lawless conflict zones . the us and britain are among the 35 countries that have backed the swiss code , and 58 private security companies – including xe services , formerly known as blackwater – have already signed up . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german farmers and the government are not happy . the european commission on thursday released a rough draft for the eu 's agricultural policy as of 2013 .
according to a commission press release , the proposed reforms aim to make the bloc 's policy " greener , fairer , more efficient and more effective . "
german farmers however , see the changes in a less favorable light . gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' association , said the new proposals were " more of a step backwards than a step forwards . "
agriculture minister ilse aigner said subsidy ceilings for large agricultural plants were something she " could n't support . " " we 're ready , to a limited degree , to accept an adjustment , " she said .
" but we will stand up against any attempt at leveling down . " some 56 billion euros -lrb- $ 76 billion -rrb- a year , or 40 percent of the eu budget , is spent on agricultural subsidies .
about 6.9 billion of that goes to germany .
now the commission wants the cash to be divided in what it describes as a more fair and transparent way . the eu 's agricultural policy is " not just for farmers , it is for all eu citizens - as consumers and taxpayers , " said eu agriculture and rural development commissioner dacian ciolos in a statement .
" european agriculture needs to be not only economically competitive , but also environmentally competitive . " taking the cost of going organic into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to take into account the extra effort needed for organic farming currently subsidies are distributed primarily based on the size of a farm .
the new proposals would take into consideration the number of employees needed to farm each hectare so that farmers who use more employees to farm in more environmentally friendly ways are not penalized for their efforts . aigner said she was skeptical of the move to link environmentally friendly farming with more subsidies , saying the emphasis on organic or ecological requirements would require more inspections and monitoring .

but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .

german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .
the company announced earlier this month that 244,000 german residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of street view - less than three percent of residents .

germany represented a major hole in street view coverage of western europe , as it has already been available for many months and , in some cases , years , in the united kingdom , france , and the czech republic .
despite the street view launch , german data protection authorities are continuing to pursue investigations against google over the fact that the company inadvertently collected data , including email addresses and passwords while scanning over open wifi networks .
the company has maintained that this data collection was a mistake and that it has changed its policies accordingly . google also remains under investigation in many countries around the world , including spain , italy and canada .

this could be the first year the prize wo n't be handed out . six countries have turned down an invitation for their ambassadors in oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo next month , the nobel institute said on thursday .
" as of this morning , 36 ambassadors had accepted our invitation , 16 had not replied and six had said ' no ' , " nobel institute director geir lundestad said , citing china , russia , kazakhstan , cuba , morocco and iraq as the countries in question .
as every year , the institute has invited all ambassadors based in the norwegian capital to attend the december ceremony , and the diplomats had until november 15 to say whether or not they would come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lundestad said said countries said ' no ' china 's leaders were enraged by the decision to give the 2010 peace prize to liu , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last december on subversion charges after co-authoring a manifesto calling for political reform in china .
the chinese embassy in oslo sent a letter to other countries ' missions in the city requesting that they refrain from attending the ceremony .
despite the warning , most western countries , including the united states , britain , france and germany have said they will attend .
unique award ceremeony with liu in prison and his wife liu xia under house arrest and his two brothers not sure of being able to leave china , it appears unlikely that anyone from the laureate 's family will be able to come to the norwegian capital to receive the nobel peace prize .
thus , although the prize ceremony will go on as planned , lundestad said it was likely the prize medal , diploma , and award of 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.36 million -rrb- would not be handed out this year .
it would be the first time in the prize 's 109-year history that neither the laureate nor a representative will show up to receive the prestigious award .
on the three previous occasions the winner was unable to make it to oslo , each time a representative attended the ceremony and collected the prize instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 18.11.2010 google launches street view across 20 german cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google navigated a web of privacy concerns in germany to publish its photos following much controversy , highly detailed street-level photographs are now available in berlin , cologne , hannover and beyond .
but google remains under investigation for potential street view privacy violations . on thursday , google finally launched street view in 20 cities around germany at an event held in hamburg .
the highly-anticipated online mapping service , which provides detailed street-level photographs of cities including berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , has been met with significant levels of public and private concern across the country over the last two-and-a-half years .
" new technologies always open up new opportunities and new questions , " said phillipp schindler , vice president of north and central europe for google , in a statement .
" in this context , our long journey of preparation and hard work is behind us , which included many meetings .
but i am pleased that our users , as of today , can try out the street view feature for germany 's biggest cities themselves . "
a southern german town opens its arms to google earlier this month , google launched street view first in the bavarian town of oberstaufen , which famously welcomed google with open arms , and even went as far as to bake the company a cake to show their appreciation for an anticipated boost in tourism .
the company also included street view photographs of various german soccer stadiums and a few other public spaces and points of interest around the country .
google representatives were quick to highlight the case of oberstaufen , which has been google 's biggest cheerleader on a municipal level in germany .
even the hall where the event was held was lined with blown-up street view photos from oberstaufen , whose mayor was also in attendance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen welcomed the street view service , said tourism official bianca keybach " -lsb- since street view began , -rsb- we got hundreds of calls , e-mails and messages from people that did n't know oberstaufen before , found it on street view and are now planning a holiday in the next few months , " said bianca keybach , the head of the oberstaufen tourist office , in an interview with deutsche welle .
photos began in 2008 but things have not always gone so smoothly for google , particularly since june 2008 , when the company began dialogue with the data protection authority in the german city-state of hamburg .
google germany 's offices are based in the city , and the company began deploying its cars in august 2008 .
by comparison , schindler added that such discussions with french data protection authorities took just a week .
however , earlier this year , public pressure increased , particularly from ilse aigner , the minister for consumer affairs , and guido westerwelle , the foreign minister , who both publicly stated that they would do everything that they could to stop google .
many in germany have had a visceral reaction against the silicon valley giant , in a country that famously guards its privacy in the aftermath of abuses by the third reich and the stasi , the east german secret police .
the country has not held a census since reunification over privacy concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view captures did n't just come from cars - bikes and even snowmobiles were used privacy remains a cultural issue peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel , told deutsche welle after the launch event that his company does understand that , culturally , privacy means something different in germany than it does in google 's home country of the united states .
" what 's interesting is to see how these different cultural understandings get translated in the context of a new service , " he said .
" everything about street view - there was almost no public debate about it neighboring countries like denmark or the netherlands - it 's not just the us .
so even within europe , there are dramatic cultural differences . "
the basic tenant of german privacy law is that one must opt-in to explicitly allow any type of data collection – google seemingly has managed to avoid legal action against street view until now .
however , after consultation with german privacy officials over the summer , google relented and allowed german residents an eight-week opt-out period that ended on october 15 .
by filling out an online form , residents could request that google have their houses blurred from view .
german chancellor angela merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from street view .
google took this unprecedented step as a way to comply with german privacy law and has publicly said previously that it had no plans to include this opt-out feature in future rollouts of the service in other countries .

the government has been using an emergency decree to target opposition media . ever since dozens were killed and hundreds injured in may , in the worst political violence seen in thailand for decades , the government has said it is in favor of national reconciliation .
yet , an emergency decree remains in force and the pro-opposition media have been targeted . " this allows the government to just shut down any website or any radio station or television without the proper use of law , " supinya klangnarong , a respected media rights advocate in thailand , who is currently vice-chair of the campaign for popular media reform , told deutsche welle . " the government does n't want to allow the opposition to exercise or express much because it is worried this could lead to another chaotic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reform activist supinya klangarong calls for open dialogue deeply divided nation " thailand is a deeply divided nation , " supinya klangnarong points out . the political conflict between the " red-shirted " poor , both urban and rural , and the " yellow-shirted " urban elites , which includes the royalists , bureaucrats and military top brass is becoming more entrenched . the young activist , who shot to fame in 2006 when she publicly challenged the then prime minister thaksin shinawatra , describes a silent majority caught between two increasingly passionate groups without means of finding a voice . she advocates a more open atmosphere where people can discuss their different points of view and has urged the government to make its criteria for what can or can not be said clearer . media should encourage open dialogue moreover , she has called on certain parts of the media to be less partisan , pointing out that 90 percent of thais rely on broadcast media rather than the internet , which is difficult to access , for information . " if the mass media did their job , " she says , " if they called the right agenda against the government , questioning the rule of law and also raising different voices and ideas , this would help shape the future of thai politics in a proper way . " there are some 8,000 unlicensed community radios in thailand , as well as hundreds of cable and satellite television stations .
the 2008 printing act allowed print media to publish anything , but the emergency decree has been used to censor opposition media without transparency or accountability . " bildunterschrift : in may , thailand witnessed its worst political violence in contemporary history she also suggests that the partisan media engage in more peaceful dialogue , to avoid drawing negative attention . behind-the-scenes role of the monarchy some analysts argue that the confusion around king bhumibol 's succession is also hindering national reconciliation in thailand . although the 82-year-old monarch is popular , his son and presumed heir crown prince maha vajiralongkorn is not considered capable of bridging the political divide . supinya klangnarong thinks it is hard to gauge how important the monarchy 's behind-the-scenes role really is . " the role of the monarchy is supposed not to be connected with the government or any political groups but it would seem that different sides have been politicizing the issue and the laws related to lese majeste are being used by the government to silence critics or dissidents , " she explains . " we do not have a clue about how this can be solved because it 's a really serious and sensitive issue , which people do not dare talk about in public . " unpredictability of thai politics even elections , which are due next year , might not resolve the situation in thailand .
observers say that the pheu thai party , the third reincarnation of a party founded by thaksin shinawatra , could well win , angering the " yellows " and many in the military , which reportedly is also divided .
more protests or even a military coup could be possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear next year 's elections could lead to more clashes or even a military coup supinya could not forecast whether the polls would go ahead at all : " honestly , i really believe we will see them happen , but i 'm also worried that they could be delayed for whatever reason .

german farmers and the government are not happy . the european commission on thursday released a rough draft for the eu 's agricultural policy as of 2013 .
according to a commission press release , the proposed reforms aim to make the bloc 's policy " greener , fairer , more efficient and more effective . "
german farmers however , see the changes in a less favorable light . gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' association , said the new proposals were " more of a step backwards than a step forwards . "
agriculture minister ilse aigner said subsidy ceilings for large agricultural plants were something she " could n't support . " " we 're ready , to a limited degree , to accept an adjustment , " she said .
" but we will stand up against any attempt at leveling down . " some 56 billion euros -lrb- $ 76 billion -rrb- a year , or 40 percent of the eu budget , is spent on agricultural subsidies .
about 6.9 billion of that goes to germany .
now the commission wants the cash to be divided in what it describes as a more fair and transparent way . the eu 's agricultural policy is " not just for farmers , it is for all eu citizens - as consumers and taxpayers , " said eu agriculture and rural development commissioner dacian ciolos in a statement .
" european agriculture needs to be not only economically competitive , but also environmentally competitive . " taking the cost of going organic into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to take into account the extra effort needed for organic farming currently subsidies are distributed primarily based on the size of a farm .
the new proposals would take into consideration the number of employees needed to farm each hectare so that farmers who use more employees to farm in more environmentally friendly ways are not penalized for their efforts . aigner said she was skeptical of the move to link environmentally friendly farming with more subsidies , saying the emphasis on organic or ecological requirements would require more inspections and monitoring .
" the environment is n't helped when it 's just the bureaucracy that flourishes , " she said . author : holly fox -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as an eu / imf mission is in dublin for emergency talks . the governor of ireland 's central bank said on thursday that he expected dublin to accept tens of billions of euros in loans from european partners and the imf to shore up its indebted banking sector .
patrick honohan made the comments as a joint mission of the european commission , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- began talks in dublin on a possible rescue package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honohan : the loan could be worth tens of billions of euros " the intention is and the expectation is , on their part and personally on my part , that negotiations or discussions will be effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as necessary , " honohan told irish state broadcaster rte .
" we 're talking about a very substantial loan for sure - tens of billions , yes , " honohan said , acknowledging that there had been substantial outflows of funds from the irish banking sector since april .
but finance minister brian lenihan played down expectations of an imminent bailout , saying ireland was not yet at the point of taking a substantial international loan .
in a move to calm the irish people , lenihan also said the government was extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of next year , six months longer than previously announced .
markets rebound as bailout expectations arise meanwhile , following 10 consecutive days of losses , european markets and the euro rebounded on thursday , banking on expectations dublin would follow athens in becoming the second eurozone member to accept an eu / imf bailout package .
eu sources say ireland may need assistance of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 61-122 billion -rrb- , depending on whether it needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well .
in an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead , france said ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate - a taboo in irish politics - in return for the assistance package .
ecb calls for ' quantum leap ' in economic governance however , while market fears may have been dampened , the head of the european central bank expressed " grave concerns " about economic governance in the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet : the eurozone is in great need of governance speaking at a central banking conference in frankfurt , jean-claude trichet bemoaned the weakening of the stability and growth pact - which seeks to limit the budget deficits of eu member states to 3 percent of gdp - and called for " quantum leap " in economic governance in an " exceptionally demanding and uncertain " environment .
as of yet , no details have emerged from the dublin talks , with a spokeswoman for the imf declining to comment on " hypothetical " questions about how much aid ireland might need or how an aid package could be structured .
she said the imf mission was working together with its european partners " to assess what may need to be done to assure financial stability . "

the french constitutional court was ordered on tuesday to decide if the law banning marriage for same-sex couples is compatible with the country 's constitution .
gay rights campaigners in the country say this means gay marriage could be legalized as early as next year .
the case began with a lesbian couple living in champagne that wanted to get married and thought it was unfair that they are not allowed to under french law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court of cassation said gay marriage was ' the subject of broad debate ' this summer a court in the champagne city of reims said the court of cassation - roughly equivalent to a supreme court - should decide the issue .
that court has referred the case to the constitutional court to rule on the matter , noting that same-sex marriage " is today the subject of a broad debate within society , notably because of the evolution of morals and the recognition of same-sex marriages by the laws of several foreign countries . "
france ' lagging behind ' on human rights this court has the power to over-turn legislation , and emmanuel ludo , the lawyer representing the champagne couple , said he is confident it will do so .
he said refusing the right to marry to same-sex couples amounts to the denial of an individual freedom .
" france is lagging behind certain european countries and certain other countries in the world - notably in latin america , " ludo told rtl radio .
" france is a country that respects human rights and yet we are lagging behind when it comes to gay marriage .
it is high time we caught up . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludo said france lags behind latin america , as argentina has legalized gay marriage laurence weber , president of an association called execo , or equal , said overturning the gay marriage ban would put an end to a form of discrimination .
" this would allow us , first of all , to abolish the sexuality hierarchy and to put an end to the idea that heterosexuality is superior , " weber said .
" that 's the principle of the thing .
but legalizing gay marriage would also make life a lot easier for many gay couples on a practical level . "
margins of society sophie aslawhere is one of the two mothers who are demanding the legalization of same-sex marriage .
she has been living with her partner for 15 years and the two of them have been bringing up four children together .
aslawhere said allowing her and her partner to marry would give their relationship the status it currently lacks in other people 's eyes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries offer some form of legal recognition for same-sex couples " our children are fed up of being treated as though they are on the margins of society , " she said .
" for example a few years ago when they held elections at our children 's school for a new parents ' organization , they did n't accept my partner 's vote .
that marginalizes our children and that should n't happen . "
same-sex marriage has been legalized by court order or legislation in the netherlands , belgium , spain , portugal , norway , sweden , iceland , south africa , canada and argentina .
many other european countries , including france , have some form of registered partnerships for same-sex couples that offer some or all of the legal rights of marriage .
the constitutional court has three months to make its decision .

but that has n't stopped it from hosting the first osce summit in more than a decade in its glittering capital of astana . the leaders of the 50-plus members of the organization for security cooperation in europe begin two days of meeting on december 1 in kazakhstan 's capital to discuss terrorism and regional security , as well as democracy and human rights issues . the meeting is a historic event for kazakhstan as it is the osce 's first summit since 1999 and represents the first time one has been hosted by a post-soviet state . as a predominantly muslim-country in troubled central asia , kazakhstan stands out due to its stable government and because terrorism and extremism are not major problems in the country . but international observers and local activists still question kazakhstan 's poor record in the areas of human rights and democracy . rights campaigners , including yuri gusakov of kazakhstan 's bureau for human rights and the rule of law , have been trying to get the government to live up to its international commitments to protect human rights and promote democracy . " work is needed in drafting laws and in the implementation of the law , " gusakov said .
" adult people who wear the uniforms are n't able to uphold human rights and ca n't guarantee them despite the constitution and existing laws . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like its new capital astana , kazakhstan 's human rights record is a work in progress slow progress of democracy human rights watch also cited numerous rights violations and pointed to the government 's stranglehold on the media as another issue of concern .
the government has forced some independent newspapers to be shut down , and the non-governmental organization has also complained about the detention of human rights activists and journalists . there has also been widespread criticism concerning the progress of democracy in kazakhstan .
a national election in 2007 was marred by complaints of voter intimidation and irregular counting . earlier this year , there was further cause for concern when 70-year-old president nursultan nazarbayev , who has led the country since before independence in 1991 , was effectively granted the right to stay in office indefinitely . economic gains despite setbacks in 2009 due to the global recession , kazakhstan 's economy is strong with per capita gdp at 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,130 -rrb- , making it one of central asia 's richer nations .
recent economic gains have been fuelled by sales of minerals and a surge in oil and gas exports . the reliance on resources is creating big disparities within society , said valentin makulkin , an economist and business consultant based in astana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil and gas exports are changing kazakhstan 's economic landscape " there is a very big social gap , " he said .
" there are only a small number of multi-millionaires or billionaires but most of the population is very poor . " official unemployment levels at the beginning of this year were at 6.5 percent of kazakhstan 's 15.5 million people .
some 12 percent of citizens are reported to live below the poverty line .
but aid agencies believe the real picture is much worse since many people in the country are employed in low wage and insecure jobs . rural poverty by some estimates , people in rural areas earn between 50 percent and 70 percent less than their urban counterparts , which can equate to as little as 70 euros a month . two decades ago , the agricultural sector accounted for a third of all economic activity in kazakhstan .
but after independence , the soviet farming cooperatives were dismantled and farmers were left to fend for themselves .
their traditional markets in the ussr were also cut off .
united nations estimates reveal that by 2007 the sector accounted for less than 6 percent of gdp . " agriculture is ruined , the manufacturing industry is also ruined and there are only natural resources left - oil , gas , metals and uranium , " makulkin said .
" these industries are capital intensive but not labor intensive .
that 's why there is a lot unemployment - either obvious or hidden . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khan shatyr shopping center is a symbol of astana 's rapid development astana rising but it 's the glitz and glamour of astana - not the poverty of rural kazakhstan - that osce leaders will see during the summit . and president nazarbayev has not been shy about investing in the capital . construction sites dominate astana 's left bank and dozens more buildings are in the planning stage .
as long as the oil money continues to flow , astana will continue to grow . over the past decade , at least $ 12 billion has been spent on transforming what used to be a second-tier kazakh city in the desert-plain into one of the world 's most modern architecturally designed cities . the khan shatyr building stands out at a local favorite .
this tent-like structure - standing 150-meters tall - was designed by briton norm foster .
its modern decor and brand-name stores are those found in any western city . kazakh goals prime minister karim masimov said he sees the summit as an opportunity to improve kazakhstan 's global standing . " i strongly believe that attention of the outside world is helping us as a government to be more productive , to be more transparent , and to be closer to the international standards , " he told foreign reporters . local activists , like gusakov , however , have said they 're seeing little difference on the ground . " nothing has changed yet , " gusakov said .
" there have been announcements that have n't been put into effect .
despite a negative reaction from the international community , no one in the osce has said that they are uncomfortable with the fact that the country which is hosting the meeting , it is violating the rules .

assange views the charges as a response to his publication of classified war documents . a stockholm court approved the request to detain assange on wednesday , after a prosecutor called for his arrests over allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion during a visit to sweden in august .
the decision , which was announced after a hearing at the stockholm district court , will allow swedish prosecutors to seek assistance from other countries to obtain assange 's arrest .
the prosecutor 's office began the investigation against assange , an australian citizen , in september .
" the reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
so far , we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations , " said marianne ny , heading up the case for the prosecution authority .
' smear campaign ' assange has strongly denied the charges , calling them baseless .
his lawyer in sweden , bjoern hurtig , has criticized the request , calling it " exaggerated " and " out of proportion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say the leaked files could further endanger soldiers ' lives " -lsb- assange -rsb- of course denies the allegations and opposes being arrested , and we do not think it is proportional to demand his arrest just to interrogate him , " hurtig told news agency afp .
he said that his client " is absolutely prepared to come to sweden -lsb- and -rsb- wants to cooperate . "
assange has previously suggested that the allegations against him could be part of a " smear campaign " aimed at discrediting his website .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought .
in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .
the publication met with widespread criticism , with german commander hans-werner fritz , currently stationed in afghanistan , calling it " absolutely irresponsible and dangerous . "
