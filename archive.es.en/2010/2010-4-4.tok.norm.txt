a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start .

" " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the revision would narrow the legal definition of aiding betrayal of state secrets , according to the report .
it would also tighten regulations of raids and confiscation of materials belonging to journalists . angela merkel 's cabinet is set to start negotiating the law in may .

the news follows another bombing that derailed a train in dagestan earlier on sunday . a computer science teacher was identified by her parents as the second of two female suicide bombers who killed dozens during a rush-hour attack on the moscow metro last week , a russian newspaper reported sunday .
rasul magomedov recognized his daughter maryam sharipova in a photograph published on the internet and sent to him by an acquaintance .
the 28-year-old disappeared the day before the march 29 bombings that killed 40 and wounded at least 121 .
sharipova was from the turbulent southern province of dagestan , also home to the woman identified as the first bomber .
on friday , russian prosecutors named dzhennet abdurakhmanova , the 17-year-old widow of an islamist militant , as the young woman who blew herself up at the park kultury metro station .
magomedov said his daughter had a degree in mathematics and psychology and had been living at home and teaching computer science since 2006 .
he said he had never noticed her express extremist views .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzhennet abdurakhmanova , left , was identified on friday " i would really like the investigation to uncover the true picture of what happened .
we can not even suggest how maryam could get to moscow .
yes , she was religious .
but she never expressed any radical beliefs , " he told the novaya gazeta newspaper .
he added that his daughter had denied allegations from local security forces that she had links to insurgents in the region and that she had married a local separatist leader .
a week of attacks the news comes after a week of attacks in russia which have resulted in at least 50 deaths .
on wednesday , two suicide bombings in the town of kizylar in dagestan killed 12 people , including nine police officers .

" joining the soldiers and officers in paying tribute to the fallen men was german development minister dirk niebel , who had extended his afghanistan trip by a day so he could attend the service . " german soldiers will not be intimidated by such malicious violence , " niebel said .

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start .

" " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip .

" the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start .

" " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .

" joining the soldiers and officers in paying tribute to the fallen men was german development minister dirk niebel , who had extended his afghanistan trip by a day so he could attend the service . " german soldiers will not be intimidated by such malicious violence , " niebel said .
" with our allies , we will continue the fight over terrorism in afghanistan and for a peaceful , stable and secure country . " the soldiers who died were on a mine clearing operation near the town of kunduz when they came under attack from around 100 taliban , military sources said . the germans were operating together with afghan troops and other members of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans inspect a burned out german military vehicle in kunduz deadly friday the violence on friday killed three soldiers from the german state of lower saxony , and wounded eight more .

the revision would narrow the legal definition of aiding betrayal of state secrets , according to the report .
it would also tighten regulations of raids and confiscation of materials belonging to journalists . angela merkel 's cabinet is set to start negotiating the law in may .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- made plans for the law in their coalition contract .
opposition within the government would therefore be unlikely , the report said . cicero affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court ruled the raid on cicero illegal calls for improving journalistic protection have been on the rise since the 2005 " cicero affair , " which began when potsdam-based magazine cicero published an article using information from a leaked classified report by the federal criminal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- . police raided the offices of the magazine , as well as the private residences of the editor-in-chief and author of the article , to discover who leaked the report . a 2007 ruling by germany 's constitutional court found the raid to be unconstitutional and a violation of press freedom because the journalists themselves were not suspected of breaking the law . paris-based journalists ' organization reporters without borders ranked germany 18th in the world in its 2009 press freedom index , behind former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania. acb / apn / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .

the revision would narrow the legal definition of aiding betrayal of state secrets , according to the report .
it would also tighten regulations of raids and confiscation of materials belonging to journalists . angela merkel 's cabinet is set to start negotiating the law in may .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- made plans for the law in their coalition contract .
opposition within the government would therefore be unlikely , the report said . cicero affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court ruled the raid on cicero illegal calls for improving journalistic protection have been on the rise since the 2005 " cicero affair , " which began when potsdam-based magazine cicero published an article using information from a leaked classified report by the federal criminal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- . police raided the offices of the magazine , as well as the private residences of the editor-in-chief and author of the article , to discover who leaked the report . a 2007 ruling by germany 's constitutional court found the raid to be unconstitutional and a violation of press freedom because the journalists themselves were not suspected of breaking the law . paris-based journalists ' organization reporters without borders ranked germany 18th in the world in its 2009 press freedom index , behind former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania. acb / apn / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .

big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "
this was certainly necessary since , despite their inexperience , the parliamentarians had to make decisions on very weighty matters .
since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .
bildunterschrift : de maziere wanted to salvage the better aspects of the gdr " we are one people ! "
this became the main thrust of his government program .

he spoke of incorporating east germans ' " sense of social justice , solidarity and tolerance " into the process of consolidation . however , his words met with little response in the frg , as helmut kohl 's government was already busy organizing the reunification of germany , and these plans left little room for input from the soon-to-be-defunct gdr .
unexpected help in addition to west german advisors , de maziere 's government also received help from an unexpected quarter .
the leader of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the old east german party of socialist unity -lrb- sed -rrb- , was gregor gysi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 04.04.2010 twenty years ago : gdr 's first freely elected parliament began work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu won the first free elections in the gdr on april 5 , 1990 , 400 representatives entered the chamber of the palace of the republic in east berlin .
they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann-pohl was both president of the people 's chamber and head of state " the civil liberties campaigners from alliance ' 90 / the greens wanted a reformed gdr , while the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- wanted to cement the old standards , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the other parties , the cdu , spd , the german social union , the liberals and the association of democrats , wanted the dissolution of the gdr and reunification with the frg . "
big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "
this was certainly necessary since , despite their inexperience , the parliamentarians had to make decisions on very weighty matters .
since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .
bildunterschrift : de maziere wanted to salvage the better aspects of the gdr " we are one people ! "
this became the main thrust of his government program .
the prime minister devoted himself to this cause and , in the next few months , also tried to save the positive aspects of the gdr for the new era of a reunified germany .
he spoke of incorporating east germans ' " sense of social justice , solidarity and tolerance " into the process of consolidation . however , his words met with little response in the frg , as helmut kohl 's government was already busy organizing the reunification of germany , and these plans left little room for input from the soon-to-be-defunct gdr .
unexpected help in addition to west german advisors , de maziere 's government also received help from an unexpected quarter .
the leader of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the old east german party of socialist unity -lrb- sed -rrb- , was gregor gysi .
the pds was fundamentally against reunification , but nonetheless gysi played a constructive part in formulating numerous constitutional amendments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of the people 's chamber ended on october 3 , 1990 the work of the first freely-elected people 's chamber ended on october 3 , 1990 , the day east and west germany were reunited . the parliamentarians in east berlin had fulfilled the wishes of the gdr 's citizens .
they laid the groundwork for the call " we are one people ! " to become reality .
45 years after the end of the second world war , which resulted in the division of germany and europe , germans could once again live in a single country .

the revision would narrow the legal definition of aiding betrayal of state secrets , according to the report .
it would also tighten regulations of raids and confiscation of materials belonging to journalists . angela merkel 's cabinet is set to start negotiating the law in may .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- made plans for the law in their coalition contract .
opposition within the government would therefore be unlikely , the report said . cicero affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court ruled the raid on cicero illegal calls for improving journalistic protection have been on the rise since the 2005 " cicero affair , " which began when potsdam-based magazine cicero published an article using information from a leaked classified report by the federal criminal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- . police raided the offices of the magazine , as well as the private residences of the editor-in-chief and author of the article , to discover who leaked the report . a 2007 ruling by germany 's constitutional court found the raid to be unconstitutional and a violation of press freedom because the journalists themselves were not suspected of breaking the law . paris-based journalists ' organization reporters without borders ranked germany 18th in the world in its 2009 press freedom index , behind former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania. acb / apn / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" joining the soldiers and officers in paying tribute to the fallen men was german development minister dirk niebel , who had extended his afghanistan trip by a day so he could attend the service . " german soldiers will not be intimidated by such malicious violence , " niebel said .
" with our allies , we will continue the fight over terrorism in afghanistan and for a peaceful , stable and secure country . " the soldiers who died were on a mine clearing operation near the town of kunduz when they came under attack from around 100 taliban , military sources said . the germans were operating together with afghan troops and other members of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans inspect a burned out german military vehicle in kunduz deadly friday the violence on friday killed three soldiers from the german state of lower saxony , and wounded eight more .

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann-pohl was both president of the people 's chamber and head of state " the civil liberties campaigners from alliance ' 90 / the greens wanted a reformed gdr , while the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- wanted to cement the old standards , " said bergmann-pohl .

big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "
this was certainly necessary since , despite their inexperience , the parliamentarians had to make decisions on very weighty matters .
since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .
bildunterschrift : de maziere wanted to salvage the better aspects of the gdr " we are one people ! "
this became the main thrust of his government program .
the prime minister devoted himself to this cause and , in the next few months , also tried to save the positive aspects of the gdr for the new era of a reunified germany .
he spoke of incorporating east germans ' " sense of social justice , solidarity and tolerance " into the process of consolidation . however , his words met with little response in the frg , as helmut kohl 's government was already busy organizing the reunification of germany , and these plans left little room for input from the soon-to-be-defunct gdr .
unexpected help in addition to west german advisors , de maziere 's government also received help from an unexpected quarter .
the leader of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the old east german party of socialist unity -lrb- sed -rrb- , was gregor gysi .

they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .

big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "

since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .
bildunterschrift : de maziere wanted to salvage the better aspects of the gdr " we are one people ! "
this became the main thrust of his government program .
the prime minister devoted himself to this cause and , in the next few months , also tried to save the positive aspects of the gdr for the new era of a reunified germany .
he spoke of incorporating east germans ' " sense of social justice , solidarity and tolerance " into the process of consolidation . however , his words met with little response in the frg , as helmut kohl 's government was already busy organizing the reunification of germany , and these plans left little room for input from the soon-to-be-defunct gdr .
unexpected help in addition to west german advisors , de maziere 's government also received help from an unexpected quarter .
the leader of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the old east german party of socialist unity -lrb- sed -rrb- , was gregor gysi .
the pds was fundamentally against reunification , but nonetheless gysi played a constructive part in formulating numerous constitutional amendments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 04.04.2010 twenty years ago : gdr 's first freely elected parliament began work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu won the first free elections in the gdr on april 5 , 1990 , 400 representatives entered the chamber of the palace of the republic in east berlin .
they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann-pohl was both president of the people 's chamber and head of state " the civil liberties campaigners from alliance ' 90 / the greens wanted a reformed gdr , while the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- wanted to cement the old standards , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the other parties , the cdu , spd , the german social union , the liberals and the association of democrats , wanted the dissolution of the gdr and reunification with the frg . "
big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "
this was certainly necessary since , despite their inexperience , the parliamentarians had to make decisions on very weighty matters .
since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .
bildunterschrift : de maziere wanted to salvage the better aspects of the gdr " we are one people ! "
this became the main thrust of his government program .
the prime minister devoted himself to this cause and , in the next few months , also tried to save the positive aspects of the gdr for the new era of a reunified germany .
he spoke of incorporating east germans ' " sense of social justice , solidarity and tolerance " into the process of consolidation . however , his words met with little response in the frg , as helmut kohl 's government was already busy organizing the reunification of germany , and these plans left little room for input from the soon-to-be-defunct gdr .
unexpected help in addition to west german advisors , de maziere 's government also received help from an unexpected quarter .
the leader of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the old east german party of socialist unity -lrb- sed -rrb- , was gregor gysi .
the pds was fundamentally against reunification , but nonetheless gysi played a constructive part in formulating numerous constitutional amendments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of the people 's chamber ended on october 3 , 1990 the work of the first freely-elected people 's chamber ended on october 3 , 1990 , the day east and west germany were reunited . the parliamentarians in east berlin had fulfilled the wishes of the gdr 's citizens .
they laid the groundwork for the call " we are one people ! " to become reality .
45 years after the end of the second world war , which resulted in the division of germany and europe , germans could once again live in a single country .

it 's unclear what penalty hamburg will impose on striker paolo guerrero . hamburg forward paolo guerrero is expected to face punishment after hurling a plastic water bottle at a jeering fan following the team 's 0-0 draw against hanover 96 . as hamburg was leaving the soccer pitch , a man in the audience insulted guerrero , who reacted by throwing the bottle , striking the fan in the head . " this can not happen even though there was extreme abuse , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia .
" we will talk to the player . " " it ’ s unacceptable , and we will make sure he is punished , " said club president bernd hoffmann . the technical director of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , said that guerrero could also face sanctions from them . " one must keep one 's emotions under control .
and i do n't need to mention the importance of players serving as role models , " said matthias sammer . but teammate frank rost downplayed guerrero 's behavior . " that throw was right on target .

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on april 2 , our hope was destroyed . " joining the soldiers and officers in paying tribute to the fallen men was german development minister dirk niebel , who had extended his afghanistan trip by a day so he could attend the service . " german soldiers will not be intimidated by such malicious violence , " niebel said .
" with our allies , we will continue the fight over terrorism in afghanistan and for a peaceful , stable and secure country . " the soldiers who died were on a mine clearing operation near the town of kunduz when they came under attack from around 100 taliban , military sources said . the germans were operating together with afghan troops and other members of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans inspect a burned out german military vehicle in kunduz deadly friday the violence on friday killed three soldiers from the german state of lower saxony , and wounded eight more .

" and they do n't understand why they have to explain themselves to the german public , or why they could even be prosecuted . " the bundeswehr 's military involvement in afghanistan is unpopular with the majority of germans , but chancellor angela merkel and her coalition government see a continuing commitment to the nato presence in the country as central to german foreign policy . germany has around 4,500 troops in the country and is the third-largest nato contributor to the war .

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but every 10 years it is transformed into the stage for a monumental passion play .
and 2010 is one of those years . it all began 377 years ago when the residents of oberammergau made a vow to god .
if he spared them from the bubonic plague that was sweeping the region at that time , they would give thanks by staging a passion play once every ten years .
centuries and many generations have passed since then , but the people of oberammergau are still honoring that age-old pledge .
for the past few months the 5,000-strong community has been preparing for this year 's play , which will be performed by a troop of amateurs between may and october .
prior to and during those months , the village becomes a whole different world populated by men with long hair and beards .
not wigs and stick-ons , but the real thing - because in keeping with tradition , men who want to be involved are not allowed to visit the barber for more than a year before the premiere .
passionate about the passion bildunterschrift : passion play director christian stueckl at work every night the amateur actors gather in the little theater for rehearsals , currently led by director christian stueckl .
it 's his third time at the helm of the production and he is no stranger to the challenges of working with an amateur cast .
but he is determined to get the most out of the players , and not only because he wants the half-million expected visitors to go home content .
for stueckl , the passion is a part of his heritage .
like most all of the approximately 2,500 actors involved , stueckl is native to oberammergau and he has been close to the passion all his life .
" i grew up in a family where the passion play was a constant source of discussion , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty much fed to me in my mother 's milk .
in 1970 , when i was seven years old , i was always at the passion with my grandfather .
i became deeply involved at a very early age . "
on being jesus and mary with just a few weeks to go until opening day , the whole village is now deeply involved .
perhaps nobody more than thirty-year old frederik mayet , who is playing the part of jesus for the first time .
bildunterschrift : letting their hair grow is a condition for participation in order to prepare for the role , he and the other lead actors spent two weeks in israel under the guidance of a religious specialist .
and although the trip was helpful , it did n't diminish the size of the task he faces .
" when i found out that i was going to play the part of jesus , i was overwhelmed , " mayet said .
" but after the initial euphoria evaporated , i began to think and to realize that it is a huge challenge . "
he is not alone in feeling anxious .
sculptor and mother of two andrea hecht is playing mary , mother of god , for the second time .
as such she will have stand before thousands of people and express her utmost desperation at seeing jesus on the cross .
she too , sees it as a challenge .
" the acting is really hard work , seeing which emotions you have to let out from inside .
from one second to the next you have to be weak and fall to the ground , or shout at the top of your voice , and it 's not that easy to do in front of strangers . "
bildunterschrift : andrea hecht will play mary both lead actors enjoy the rehearsals and the mood of excitement mounting in the village as the premiere date inches closer .
but there is still much to do .
the stage set is n't finished and all the costumes have to be dyed by hand in order to get the exact colours needed to make the clothing look authentic .
business not as usual it 's a lot of work for everyone involved , but ultimately the play is of huge benefit to the village and its residents .
werner hirrlinger oversees the sale of visitor packages , which range from between 200 -lrb- $ 266 -rrb- and 800 euros in price , and include entry to the passion and one or two nights in the village .
despite the worldwide economic crisis and a decline in tourist visits , most notably from the us , hirrlinger is quite happy with the way business is going .
" oberammergau has been very spoiled in the past , because the performances are generally sold out a year in advance , " he said .
" that 's not the case this year , but our returns rate is only about five percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertsing for the passion returned tickets are put back up for sale and the mayor of oberammergau , arno nunn , is keen to see them snapped up .
he 's hoping that all 102 performances will sell out , not least because the little alpine community desperately needs a financial blessing .
" while it is a pledge , there 's no denying the fact that it has huge financial implications for the community , " nunn said .
" as in previous decades , we 're expecting as many as half a million visitors .
in the year 2000 , that brought in a return of around 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- and we hope to reach a similar level this year . "
and if they do , the passion in oberammergau will not only have saved the community from the plague , but from the very modern threat of financial ruin .

he spoke to dw-world about the role . dw-world : you played the part of john the apostle in the last oberammergau passion .
is jesus your dream role ?
frederik mayet : i do n't know yet .
if i 'd been allowed to choose for myself , i 'd have chosen judas .
when i found out that i was going to play the part of jesus , i was overwhelmed , but two or three days later , after the initial euphoria had worn off , i began to think and to realize that it is a huge challenge .
our director christian stueckl said the role is an impertinence and now i understand what he meant .
how do you feel when you 're on the cross ?
the feeling of being exhibited like that is really uncomfortable .
you really realize what a dreadful way it was to die .
when you are on the cross , how far from the ground are you ?
from my head to the ground it 's about four meters .
i 'm secured by a climbing belt under my loincloth so that nothing can happen .
bildunterschrift : the passion in preparation how did you prepare for the role ?
the most important thing for me was the trip to israel in september .
we had a week of intense discussions and we were accompanied by a great theologian , thomas frauenlob , who works at the vatican .
he answered all our questions , even the critical ones .
and the discussions with christian stueckl were really helpful as well .
and then i read a couple of books about jesus , i read some of the gospels , i looked through the texts .
and we also have voice training .
the role of jesus has been interpreted differently at different times .
what are your priorities ?
twenty years ago , our director christian stueckl was particularly interested in the fighter , the revolutionary in jesus , but that has faded into the background a bit now .
i 'm particularly interested in those of his statements which still hold true today .
the ones we recognize as clichés , yet which we find it hard to integrate into our lives , things like " love thy neighbor as thyself , " or the one about turning the left cheek if you are slapped on the right .
if we really lived by those statements , our world would be a better place , so i think it 's really important to present them in a fresh way on stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costumes are made from cloth found in india do you have to be very religious to be able to play jesus ?
i do n't think so , but it helps if you know about jesus and know the story .
i would describe myself as a believer , but non-believing actors could also tackle the role .
i would say they should have an interest in the character .
how often do you rehearse at the moment ?
five or six times a week .
we are all amateurs in oberammergau , which means we go out to work during the day .
we rehearse in the evening and at weekends , but not everyone is in every scene .
jesus is though , which means andreas richter , the other actor who plays jesus , and i have to be there a lot . has the experience changed the way you see jesus ?
at every rehearsal , i learn new facets about the diverse nature of his character .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 04.04.2010 twenty years ago : gdr 's first freely elected parliament began work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu won the first free elections in the gdr on april 5 , 1990 , 400 representatives entered the chamber of the palace of the republic in east berlin .
they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann-pohl was both president of the people 's chamber and head of state " the civil liberties campaigners from alliance ' 90 / the greens wanted a reformed gdr , while the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- wanted to cement the old standards , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the other parties , the cdu , spd , the german social union , the liberals and the association of democrats , wanted the dissolution of the gdr and reunification with the frg . "
big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "
this was certainly necessary since , despite their inexperience , the parliamentarians had to make decisions on very weighty matters .
since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .
bildunterschrift : de maziere wanted to salvage the better aspects of the gdr " we are one people ! "
this became the main thrust of his government program .
the prime minister devoted himself to this cause and , in the next few months , also tried to save the positive aspects of the gdr for the new era of a reunified germany .
he spoke of incorporating east germans ' " sense of social justice , solidarity and tolerance " into the process of consolidation . however , his words met with little response in the frg , as helmut kohl 's government was already busy organizing the reunification of germany , and these plans left little room for input from the soon-to-be-defunct gdr .
unexpected help in addition to west german advisors , de maziere 's government also received help from an unexpected quarter .
the leader of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the old east german party of socialist unity -lrb- sed -rrb- , was gregor gysi .
the pds was fundamentally against reunification , but nonetheless gysi played a constructive part in formulating numerous constitutional amendments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of the people 's chamber ended on october 3 , 1990 the work of the first freely-elected people 's chamber ended on october 3 , 1990 , the day east and west germany were reunited . the parliamentarians in east berlin had fulfilled the wishes of the gdr 's citizens .
they laid the groundwork for the call " we are one people ! " to become reality .

the revision would narrow the legal definition of aiding betrayal of state secrets , according to the report .
it would also tighten regulations of raids and confiscation of materials belonging to journalists . angela merkel 's cabinet is set to start negotiating the law in may .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- made plans for the law in their coalition contract .

they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann-pohl was both president of the people 's chamber and head of state " the civil liberties campaigners from alliance ' 90 / the greens wanted a reformed gdr , while the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- wanted to cement the old standards , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the other parties , the cdu , spd , the german social union , the liberals and the association of democrats , wanted the dissolution of the gdr and reunification with the frg . "
big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "
this was certainly necessary since , despite their inexperience , the parliamentarians had to make decisions on very weighty matters .
since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .
bildunterschrift : de maziere wanted to salvage the better aspects of the gdr " we are one people ! "
this became the main thrust of his government program .
the prime minister devoted himself to this cause and , in the next few months , also tried to save the positive aspects of the gdr for the new era of a reunified germany .
he spoke of incorporating east germans ' " sense of social justice , solidarity and tolerance " into the process of consolidation . however , his words met with little response in the frg , as helmut kohl 's government was already busy organizing the reunification of germany , and these plans left little room for input from the soon-to-be-defunct gdr .
unexpected help in addition to west german advisors , de maziere 's government also received help from an unexpected quarter .
the leader of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the old east german party of socialist unity -lrb- sed -rrb- , was gregor gysi .
the pds was fundamentally against reunification , but nonetheless gysi played a constructive part in formulating numerous constitutional amendments .

the revision would narrow the legal definition of aiding betrayal of state secrets , according to the report .
it would also tighten regulations of raids and confiscation of materials belonging to journalists . angela merkel 's cabinet is set to start negotiating the law in may .

" on april 2 , our hope was destroyed . " joining the soldiers and officers in paying tribute to the fallen men was german development minister dirk niebel , who had extended his afghanistan trip by a day so he could attend the service . " german soldiers will not be intimidated by such malicious violence , " niebel said .
" with our allies , we will continue the fight over terrorism in afghanistan and for a peaceful , stable and secure country . " the soldiers who died were on a mine clearing operation near the town of kunduz when they came under attack from around 100 taliban , military sources said . the germans were operating together with afghan troops and other members of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans inspect a burned out german military vehicle in kunduz deadly friday the violence on friday killed three soldiers from the german state of lower saxony , and wounded eight more .

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior cardinal dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " applause rang out in st. peter 's square as pope benedict xvi concluded a much-anticipated easter mass on sunday , in which a senior cardinal praised the pontiff 's leadership and dismissed the allegations against him as " petty gossip . " the pope urged humanity to undergo a " spiritual and moral conversion " during his traditional easter message , but did not directly address the ongoing scandal over child abuse which has rocked the roman catholic church worldwide . the leader of some 1.1 billion catholics was under pressure to reiterate his condemnation of predator priests in his " urbi et orbi " message to the world , but the only oblique reference to the scandal came in a surprise speech by the dean of the vatican 's college of cardinals , angelo sodano . " holy father , the people of god are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers , " sodano said . sodano 's remarks were believed to be the first time in recent memory that the protocol of a papal easter sunday mass was changed to allow someone to address the pope at the start . " the church is with you , " sodano told the pontiff to the cheers of thousands of people in a rainy st peter 's square . clouded by scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many priests expressed their support for the pope the celebrations leading up to easter sunday have been overshadowed by european bishops condemning the church 's role in child abuse cases and fresh allegations of cover-up emerging against a prominent cardinal in the united states . over the easter weekend , top bishops in both belgium and germany have issued forthright condemnations of the church 's role in covering up abuse within its ranks . the leader of germany 's roman catholic bishops , archbishop robert zollitsch , said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . " " the church must not be inactive : we need a new beginning , " zollitsch wrote in his easter message on the web site of his archdiocese of freiburg im breisgau in southwest germany . belgian archbishop andre-joseph leonard of mechelen-brussel also denounced what he called the " guilty silence " of the church , criticizing officials for often caring more about the reputation of priests rather than the abused children . bildunterschrift : easter celebrations came amid a trying time for the pontiff fresh scandal in america in the united states , a fierce defender of pope benedict xvi during this ongoing scandal has now come under personal scrutiny .
court documents show cardinal william levada reassigned a priest and alleged child molester in the 1990s without warning parishioners . in a sworn 2006 testimony about his time as archbishop of portland , levada said he decided to reassign the offending priest if he underwent therapy . " the abuse in question had happened 20 years before , or so , " levada testified .
" the recommendation of the therapy was that he was not at risk for re-abusing and that it would be prudent to reassign him . " he was asked if he had warned parishioners about the oregon priest 's past - inappropriate sexual behaviour with teenagers in the 1970s .
he said no . levada now heads the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith -lrb- cdf -rrb- and was chosen for the post by his predecessor and then cardinal joseph ratzinger , who as pope now has come under criticism for failing to act against priests accused of child abuse in the past . cb / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw-world about the role . dw-world : you played the part of john the apostle in the last oberammergau passion .
is jesus your dream role ?
frederik mayet : i do n't know yet .
if i 'd been allowed to choose for myself , i 'd have chosen judas .
when i found out that i was going to play the part of jesus , i was overwhelmed , but two or three days later , after the initial euphoria had worn off , i began to think and to realize that it is a huge challenge .
our director christian stueckl said the role is an impertinence and now i understand what he meant .
how do you feel when you 're on the cross ?
the feeling of being exhibited like that is really uncomfortable .
you really realize what a dreadful way it was to die .
when you are on the cross , how far from the ground are you ?
from my head to the ground it 's about four meters .
i 'm secured by a climbing belt under my loincloth so that nothing can happen .
bildunterschrift : the passion in preparation how did you prepare for the role ?
the most important thing for me was the trip to israel in september .
we had a week of intense discussions and we were accompanied by a great theologian , thomas frauenlob , who works at the vatican .
he answered all our questions , even the critical ones .
and the discussions with christian stueckl were really helpful as well .
and then i read a couple of books about jesus , i read some of the gospels , i looked through the texts .
and we also have voice training .
the role of jesus has been interpreted differently at different times .
what are your priorities ?
twenty years ago , our director christian stueckl was particularly interested in the fighter , the revolutionary in jesus , but that has faded into the background a bit now .
i 'm particularly interested in those of his statements which still hold true today .
the ones we recognize as clichés , yet which we find it hard to integrate into our lives , things like " love thy neighbor as thyself , " or the one about turning the left cheek if you are slapped on the right .
if we really lived by those statements , our world would be a better place , so i think it 's really important to present them in a fresh way on stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costumes are made from cloth found in india do you have to be very religious to be able to play jesus ?
i do n't think so , but it helps if you know about jesus and know the story .
i would describe myself as a believer , but non-believing actors could also tackle the role .
i would say they should have an interest in the character .
how often do you rehearse at the moment ?
five or six times a week .
we are all amateurs in oberammergau , which means we go out to work during the day .
we rehearse in the evening and at weekends , but not everyone is in every scene .
jesus is though , which means andreas richter , the other actor who plays jesus , and i have to be there a lot . has the experience changed the way you see jesus ?
at every rehearsal , i learn new facets about the diverse nature of his character .

but every 10 years it is transformed into the stage for a monumental passion play .
and 2010 is one of those years . it all began 377 years ago when the residents of oberammergau made a vow to god .
if he spared them from the bubonic plague that was sweeping the region at that time , they would give thanks by staging a passion play once every ten years .
centuries and many generations have passed since then , but the people of oberammergau are still honoring that age-old pledge .
for the past few months the 5,000-strong community has been preparing for this year 's play , which will be performed by a troop of amateurs between may and october .
prior to and during those months , the village becomes a whole different world populated by men with long hair and beards .
not wigs and stick-ons , but the real thing - because in keeping with tradition , men who want to be involved are not allowed to visit the barber for more than a year before the premiere .
passionate about the passion bildunterschrift : passion play director christian stueckl at work every night the amateur actors gather in the little theater for rehearsals , currently led by director christian stueckl .
it 's his third time at the helm of the production and he is no stranger to the challenges of working with an amateur cast .
but he is determined to get the most out of the players , and not only because he wants the half-million expected visitors to go home content .
for stueckl , the passion is a part of his heritage .
like most all of the approximately 2,500 actors involved , stueckl is native to oberammergau and he has been close to the passion all his life .
" i grew up in a family where the passion play was a constant source of discussion , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was pretty much fed to me in my mother 's milk .
in 1970 , when i was seven years old , i was always at the passion with my grandfather .
i became deeply involved at a very early age . "
on being jesus and mary with just a few weeks to go until opening day , the whole village is now deeply involved .
perhaps nobody more than thirty-year old frederik mayet , who is playing the part of jesus for the first time .
bildunterschrift : letting their hair grow is a condition for participation in order to prepare for the role , he and the other lead actors spent two weeks in israel under the guidance of a religious specialist .
and although the trip was helpful , it did n't diminish the size of the task he faces .
" when i found out that i was going to play the part of jesus , i was overwhelmed , " mayet said .
" but after the initial euphoria evaporated , i began to think and to realize that it is a huge challenge . "
he is not alone in feeling anxious .
sculptor and mother of two andrea hecht is playing mary , mother of god , for the second time .
as such she will have stand before thousands of people and express her utmost desperation at seeing jesus on the cross .
she too , sees it as a challenge .
" the acting is really hard work , seeing which emotions you have to let out from inside .
from one second to the next you have to be weak and fall to the ground , or shout at the top of your voice , and it 's not that easy to do in front of strangers . "
bildunterschrift : andrea hecht will play mary both lead actors enjoy the rehearsals and the mood of excitement mounting in the village as the premiere date inches closer .
but there is still much to do .
the stage set is n't finished and all the costumes have to be dyed by hand in order to get the exact colours needed to make the clothing look authentic .
business not as usual it 's a lot of work for everyone involved , but ultimately the play is of huge benefit to the village and its residents .
werner hirrlinger oversees the sale of visitor packages , which range from between 200 -lrb- $ 266 -rrb- and 800 euros in price , and include entry to the passion and one or two nights in the village .
despite the worldwide economic crisis and a decline in tourist visits , most notably from the us , hirrlinger is quite happy with the way business is going .
" oberammergau has been very spoiled in the past , because the performances are generally sold out a year in advance , " he said .
" that 's not the case this year , but our returns rate is only about five percent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertsing for the passion returned tickets are put back up for sale and the mayor of oberammergau , arno nunn , is keen to see them snapped up .
he 's hoping that all 102 performances will sell out , not least because the little alpine community desperately needs a financial blessing .
" while it is a pledge , there 's no denying the fact that it has huge financial implications for the community , " nunn said .
" as in previous decades , we 're expecting as many as half a million visitors .
in the year 2000 , that brought in a return of around 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- and we hope to reach a similar level this year . "
and if they do , the passion in oberammergau will not only have saved the community from the plague , but from the very modern threat of financial ruin .

they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .

they were the first parliamentarians to have come to power in free and fair elections . on march 18 , 1990 , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- emerged as the strongest party after elections to the east german parliament , the people 's chamber .
the cdu laid claim to the offices of prime minister and parliamentary president .
until this time , sabine bergmann-pohl had worked as a lung disease specialist in east berlin .
since 1981 , she 'd been a member of the east german cdu and rose up the party hierarchy . after the march elections , bergmann-pohl became not only the president of the people 's chamber , but also head of the east german state following a constitutional amendment .
mission : reunification the election campaign in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- had been dominated by a single theme : reunification with the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
in west germany , cdu chancellor helmut kohl had also made this a main focus of his campaign .
the social democrats , and their leader willy brandt , had misinterpreted the mood and expected the process of consolidation between the two german states to take much longer .
the majority of east german parliamentarians now began working towards implementing what most citizens of the gdr expected of them . but , as sabine bergmann-pohl recalled , the parties differed widely over how to achieve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann-pohl was both president of the people 's chamber and head of state " the civil liberties campaigners from alliance ' 90 / the greens wanted a reformed gdr , while the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- wanted to cement the old standards , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the other parties , the cdu , spd , the german social union , the liberals and the association of democrats , wanted the dissolution of the gdr and reunification with the frg . "
big tasks , big coalition the election outcome had made a coalition between the cdu and the liberals possible .
but the tasks ahead were so big that prime minister lothar de maiziere also incorporated the second most powerful party , the social democrats , into the government .
the proceedings of the first democratically elected people 's chamber were often chaotic . bergmann-pohl put this down to the fact that almost two-thirds of the representatives , herself included , had no parliamentary experience .
" it was a very spontaneous parliament , we had no solid rules of procedure like our west german counterparts , " said bergmann-pohl .
" the few rules that the representatives were able to agree on were constantly changing .
nevertheless , we were an exceptionally busy and conscientious parliament . "
this was certainly necessary since , despite their inexperience , the parliamentarians had to make decisions on very weighty matters .
since the future of all germans was on the agenda , the west german government also became involved .
teams of advisers from the federal republic poured in to make sure that the legal process did not only comply with both german constitutions , but also took account of the wish of most gdr citizens for reunification with west germany to happen as quickly as possible .
de maiziere also saw this as his primary obligation . in a government declaration , he summed up the sentiments felt in the gdr .
" the people of the gdr are part of one people , a part of one german people , that should grow together again , " said de maiziere .

he spoke to dw-world about the role . dw-world : you played the part of john the apostle in the last oberammergau passion .
is jesus your dream role ?
frederik mayet : i do n't know yet .
if i 'd been allowed to choose for myself , i 'd have chosen judas .
when i found out that i was going to play the part of jesus , i was overwhelmed , but two or three days later , after the initial euphoria had worn off , i began to think and to realize that it is a huge challenge .
our director christian stueckl said the role is an impertinence and now i understand what he meant .
how do you feel when you 're on the cross ?
the feeling of being exhibited like that is really uncomfortable .
you really realize what a dreadful way it was to die .
when you are on the cross , how far from the ground are you ?
from my head to the ground it 's about four meters .
i 'm secured by a climbing belt under my loincloth so that nothing can happen .
bildunterschrift : the passion in preparation how did you prepare for the role ?
the most important thing for me was the trip to israel in september .
we had a week of intense discussions and we were accompanied by a great theologian , thomas frauenlob , who works at the vatican .
he answered all our questions , even the critical ones .
and the discussions with christian stueckl were really helpful as well .
and then i read a couple of books about jesus , i read some of the gospels , i looked through the texts .
and we also have voice training .
the role of jesus has been interpreted differently at different times .
what are your priorities ?
twenty years ago , our director christian stueckl was particularly interested in the fighter , the revolutionary in jesus , but that has faded into the background a bit now .
i 'm particularly interested in those of his statements which still hold true today .
the ones we recognize as clichés , yet which we find it hard to integrate into our lives , things like " love thy neighbor as thyself , " or the one about turning the left cheek if you are slapped on the right .
if we really lived by those statements , our world would be a better place , so i think it 's really important to present them in a fresh way on stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costumes are made from cloth found in india do you have to be very religious to be able to play jesus ?
i do n't think so , but it helps if you know about jesus and know the story .
i would describe myself as a believer , but non-believing actors could also tackle the role .
i would say they should have an interest in the character .
how often do you rehearse at the moment ?
five or six times a week .
we are all amateurs in oberammergau , which means we go out to work during the day .
we rehearse in the evening and at weekends , but not everyone is in every scene .
jesus is though , which means andreas richter , the other actor who plays jesus , and i have to be there a lot . has the experience changed the way you see jesus ?
at every rehearsal , i learn new facets about the diverse nature of his character .
