they are workers employed by the foshan electrical and lighting factory in guangdong province .
just two days previously , over 50 children were reported to have lead poisoning in the jiangsu province . china is often criticised for its sub-standard safety practices inside factories and out .
in the latest reported case of mercury poisoning , a spokesperson stated that many workers could not be bothered to wear a mask when working with liquid mercury .
professor michael lentze from one of germany ’ s poison control centres pointed out that this could be quite hazardous and explained that people could be poisoned by inhaling steamed mercury .
“ workers working at an industrial plant where liquid mercury goes into the air are bound to inhale mercury and get poisoned if they do not have a mask on , ” he said .
he added that mercury could also get into the body by consuming water that had been contaminated by industrial waste or even by eating shell fish , as many pollutants ended up in the ocean .
poisoning affects the kidneys and the brain poisoning is known to have serious effects on the body and “ affects particularly the kidneys and the brain , and can therefore have neurological symptoms , ” lentze said .
heavy metal poisoning is nothing new in china .
since august 2009 , 3,000 children have been reported as having lead poisoning .
on top of that , at the end of november , over a thousand families in shaanxi province had to be relocated because they lived near a lead smelter that caused cases of poisoning .
lead is used in colouring agents for ceramic products and also in some foods , which can cause organic lead poisoning .
there is also inorganic lead poisoning , which is caused by gasoline containing lead compounds .
it gets into the body by being inhaled or defused through the skin .
“ lead is poisonous for the organs in the body .
it is poisonous for the brain , for the heart , for the liver and the kidneys , ” professor lentze explained .
heavy metal poisoning can also cause agitation , memory loss and brain damage .
there are treatments which rid the body of the compounds , if the poisoning is detected on time but prevention is , of course , far better than treatment .
some endeavours to clean up the environment “ what we ’ ve seen over the past couple of decades is that china - the industrial centre for the world in terms of production of cheap goods - has produced a lot of environmental problems , ” explained wwf country director for china , dermot o ’ gorman .
“ these are visible not only in water pollution and other pollution problems .
i think that we are seeing at the moment endeavours by the central government to clean up the environment but i think there are still a number of challenges at a provincial level of putting environmental legislation and protection into place . ”
china ’ s environment has suffered greatly under the country ’ s rapid economic development , as the government has placed more emphasis on the latter .
however , there is proof that economic development can co-exist with environmentally-friendly production and china , too , is striving towards this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 07.01.2010 top german magazine trades models for " real " women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte 's first model-free issue hit newsstands - but can you see the change ?
germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

the first satellite should be delivered in june 2012 , with an additional one to be completed every six weeks until march 2014 .

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "

it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .

the oecd said the nations had made sufficient commitments to implement oecd standards of " transparency and the exchange of information . "
still , joachim poss , deputy leader of the social democrats - germany 's largest opposition party - told the daily tageszeitung that the finance ministry 's findings were inappropriate .
" this is comparable to simply scrapping the law passed in september .
the new finance ministry , the new government , is simply fulfilling the wishes of the economy , which massively financed its political campaign , " he said .
green party economic expert gerhard schick said finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was " effectively ending the fight against tax evasion in germany . "
schaeuble , meanwhile , in an interview with the german branch of the ap news agency , called on the oecd to enforce the standards of transparency with which suspected tax havens have agreed to comply .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .
figures reveal a lower proportion of homeless people in eastern germany , a fact attributed to a greater number of vacant properties in that part of the country. rc / epd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain , which currently holds the eu presidency , has called for a common policy over using body scanners that takes concerns about privacy into account . the spanish eu presidency has called for a common european position on airport body scanners after member states clashed over the introduction of new security technology .
spanish transport minister jose blanco lopez made his appeal after eu experts met on thursday to discuss the proposed measure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.01.2010 germany eases stance on transactions with suspected tax havens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany now says there are no tax havens germany will hold off on imposing sanctions on companies and individuals who transfer money to states berlin had criticized as attracting tax evaders .
tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .
end to fight against tax havens ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization activicts say germany needs to to " dry out " tax havens germany 's new stance on tax havens follows the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- removal of all countries - including belgium , luxemburg and switzerland - from its " gray list " of uncooperative tax havens .
the oecd said the nations had made sufficient commitments to implement oecd standards of " transparency and the exchange of information . "
still , joachim poss , deputy leader of the social democrats - germany 's largest opposition party - told the daily tageszeitung that the finance ministry 's findings were inappropriate .
" this is comparable to simply scrapping the law passed in september .
the new finance ministry , the new government , is simply fulfilling the wishes of the economy , which massively financed its political campaign , " he said .
green party economic expert gerhard schick said finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was " effectively ending the fight against tax evasion in germany . "
schaeuble , meanwhile , in an interview with the german branch of the ap news agency , called on the oecd to enforce the standards of transparency with which suspected tax havens have agreed to comply .
" it is absolutely necessary that -lsb- the oecd -rsb- implement and monitor the standards these nations have agreed to , " he said. glb / apd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
on being asked whether he spoke for the whole government , westerwelle said , " i 'm not here as a tourist in shorts , but as the german foreign minister .
what i say , counts . "
westerwelle 's opposite number ahmut davutoglu responded positively to the german foreign minister 's speech , and said that turkey would do whatever it takes to gain entry to the eu .
" we want to fulfil all reforms .
everything that this process requires , we will do - especially in relation to germany . "

csu general secretary alexander dobrindt said , " i can only advise him not to come to secret agreements in turkey , as he did in poland , that we then have to clear up for weeks afterwards in the coalition . "
but in an exchange that further exacerbated tensions within the coalition government , the fdp 's minister of state werner hoyer rejected dobrindt 's statement and accused the csu of undermining the coalition contract and trying to draw attention to itself. bk / dpa / apd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ankara 's bid to join the eu could be high on the agenda . german foreign minister guido westerwelle touched down in turkey late on wednesday for high-level talks with officials in ankara .
the leader of germany 's junior coalition partners , the free democrats , will then travel to the persian gulf .
in ankara , turkish officials are expected to broach the topic of their country 's efforts to join the european union .
in recent months , several balkan states have seen progress in their eu membership applications , while turkey continues to experience delays in its own accession to the 27-nation bloc .
westerwelle has praised ankara for reforms it has made in its attempt to satisfy certain eu membership criteria but also reminded the country of 74 million that further progress was necessary .
germany 's christian social union , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey in an attempt to withhold full membership from the majority muslim nation .
in his two days in turkey , westerwelle is to meet with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , as well as turkish foreign ministry officials .
on friday , westerwelle will move on to saudi arabia , qatar and the united arab emirates , where he will be accompanied by a contingent of german business leaders eager to press their case for increased financial ties with the gulf states .
the middle east conflict is also expected to be raised during the foreign minister 's talks , as are recent developments in iran and yemen .
the six-day trip will be westerwelle 's second to the region since assuming the role of foreign minister in october .
in november , he led a delegation to israel and the palestinian territories. dfm / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .

the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .

podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .

bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .

ankara 's bid to join the eu could be high on the agenda . german foreign minister guido westerwelle touched down in turkey late on wednesday for high-level talks with officials in ankara .
the leader of germany 's junior coalition partners , the free democrats , will then travel to the persian gulf .
in ankara , turkish officials are expected to broach the topic of their country 's efforts to join the european union .
in recent months , several balkan states have seen progress in their eu membership applications , while turkey continues to experience delays in its own accession to the 27-nation bloc .
westerwelle has praised ankara for reforms it has made in its attempt to satisfy certain eu membership criteria but also reminded the country of 74 million that further progress was necessary .
germany 's christian social union , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey in an attempt to withhold full membership from the majority muslim nation .
in his two days in turkey , westerwelle is to meet with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , as well as turkish foreign ministry officials .
on friday , westerwelle will move on to saudi arabia , qatar and the united arab emirates , where he will be accompanied by a contingent of german business leaders eager to press their case for increased financial ties with the gulf states .
the middle east conflict is also expected to be raised during the foreign minister 's talks , as are recent developments in iran and yemen .
the six-day trip will be westerwelle 's second to the region since assuming the role of foreign minister in october .
in november , he led a delegation to israel and the palestinian territories. dfm / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

slovakia 's border police chief has taken responsibilty for the gaff . slovak police responsible for a botched security test that sent explosives to ireland in the luggage of an unsuspecting danube wings passenger have apologized for the fiasco . the chief of the slovak border police , tibor mako , stepped down on thursday after apologizing for a blunder in security training that resulted in 90 grams -lrb- 3.17 ounces -rrb- of explosives being transported in a passenger 's baggage to dublin . the training exercise , which took place on saturday , was intended to test the ability of bomb-sniffing dogs to find explosives at poprad airport in northeastern slovakia . slovak border police inserted test packages containing small amounts of explosives into selected passengers ' luggage without their knowledge .
forgetful officer chief mako said the package was successfully detected , but a police officer " forgot to remove the explosives after a dog found them during a security test . " " the explosives were attached by accident to the backpack .
we are sorry that a good effort to test the security of civilian air transport turned out so badly , " mako told reporters . mako said the police officer failed to inform his superiors and only told poprad airport , which in turn sent dublin airport a telex message .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 07.01.2010 places still up for grabs on germany 's world cup plane to south africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew has a lot on his mind as the world cup nears germany coach joachim loew is still deliberating over who he will take to south africa this summer .
some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 07.01.2010 france considering tax on internet advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google and other internet giants would be hit by the tax the french government is considering taxing advertising revenues from internet corporations like google .
the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .

there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .

he has stressed the need for reforms in the country . on his first trip to the turkish capital , foreign minister westerwelle told an audience of turkish diplomats that he believed that turkey was not yet ready for eu membership .
" we all know that freedom of opinion , of the press and of religion are pillars of the values of our european community , " the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said , before adding that the " work of reform in turkey on its path to europe is not yet complete .
i want to encourage you to continue . "
but he promised that germany would honor its agreements on turkey 's entry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been negotiating for eu membership since 2005 not a tourist in shorts westerwelle pointed to the government 's coalition contract , which promised to engage in eu membership negotiations with an attitude that was " open to any result . "
on being asked whether he spoke for the whole government , westerwelle said , " i 'm not here as a tourist in shorts , but as the german foreign minister .
what i say , counts . "
westerwelle 's opposite number ahmut davutoglu responded positively to the german foreign minister 's speech , and said that turkey would do whatever it takes to gain entry to the eu .
" we want to fulfil all reforms .
everything that this process requires , we will do - especially in relation to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 2.7 million people with turkish roots live in germany strife at home however , westerwelle 's words prompted a sharp response from coalition allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , several of whose members favor offering turkey " a privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership .
csu general secretary alexander dobrindt said , " i can only advise him not to come to secret agreements in turkey , as he did in poland , that we then have to clear up for weeks afterwards in the coalition . "
but in an exchange that further exacerbated tensions within the coalition government , the fdp 's minister of state werner hoyer rejected dobrindt 's statement and accused the csu of undermining the coalition contract and trying to draw attention to itself. bk / dpa / apd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain , which currently holds the eu presidency , has called for a common policy over using body scanners that takes concerns about privacy into account . the spanish eu presidency has called for a common european position on airport body scanners after member states clashed over the introduction of new security technology .
spanish transport minister jose blanco lopez made his appeal after eu experts met on thursday to discuss the proposed measure .
a number of eu countries , including spain , are unhappy about possible privacy issues relating to the scanners , which can " see through " clothing to create three-dimensional images of passengers .
lopez said that a common approach to security would be more sensible than member states taking unilateral measures .
britain and italy have decided to install the devices , while the netherlands will increase the number in use from 15 to 60 .
" it 's better for europe to have a common position because it makes no sense for european passengers to travel from london to madrid and back and have different controls , " said lopez .
" a common position would be better for all of us , even if it was n't binding , " he said .
sparked by bomb attempt the question of new security measures arose after nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab was charged with trying to blow up a us-bound jet from amsterdam on december 25 .
" we should not react hastily and assume that full body scanners are the best security measure , " said lopez .
" we have to find the right balance between security and respect for freedoms and privacy . "
the european commission said that there had been " an exchange of views " over the technology and that " an initiative " on employing it , which had previously been blocked , was being reconsidered .
" if there are no problems with human rights , health , the freedom of citizens and data use , i can not exclude that the commission could re-open the question of body scanners , " eu transport commissioner antonio tajani said. rc / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 07.01.2010 france considering tax on internet advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google and other internet giants would be hit by the tax the french government is considering taxing advertising revenues from internet corporations like google .
the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .

they are workers employed by the foshan electrical and lighting factory in guangdong province .
just two days previously , over 50 children were reported to have lead poisoning in the jiangsu province . china is often criticised for its sub-standard safety practices inside factories and out .
in the latest reported case of mercury poisoning , a spokesperson stated that many workers could not be bothered to wear a mask when working with liquid mercury .
professor michael lentze from one of germany ’ s poison control centres pointed out that this could be quite hazardous and explained that people could be poisoned by inhaling steamed mercury .
“ workers working at an industrial plant where liquid mercury goes into the air are bound to inhale mercury and get poisoned if they do not have a mask on , ” he said .
he added that mercury could also get into the body by consuming water that had been contaminated by industrial waste or even by eating shell fish , as many pollutants ended up in the ocean .
poisoning affects the kidneys and the brain poisoning is known to have serious effects on the body and “ affects particularly the kidneys and the brain , and can therefore have neurological symptoms , ” lentze said .
heavy metal poisoning is nothing new in china .
since august 2009 , 3,000 children have been reported as having lead poisoning .
on top of that , at the end of november , over a thousand families in shaanxi province had to be relocated because they lived near a lead smelter that caused cases of poisoning .
lead is used in colouring agents for ceramic products and also in some foods , which can cause organic lead poisoning .
there is also inorganic lead poisoning , which is caused by gasoline containing lead compounds .
it gets into the body by being inhaled or defused through the skin .
“ lead is poisonous for the organs in the body .
it is poisonous for the brain , for the heart , for the liver and the kidneys , ” professor lentze explained .
heavy metal poisoning can also cause agitation , memory loss and brain damage .
there are treatments which rid the body of the compounds , if the poisoning is detected on time but prevention is , of course , far better than treatment .
some endeavours to clean up the environment “ what we ’ ve seen over the past couple of decades is that china - the industrial centre for the world in terms of production of cheap goods - has produced a lot of environmental problems , ” explained wwf country director for china , dermot o ’ gorman .
“ these are visible not only in water pollution and other pollution problems .
i think that we are seeing at the moment endeavours by the central government to clean up the environment but i think there are still a number of challenges at a provincial level of putting environmental legislation and protection into place . ”
china ’ s environment has suffered greatly under the country ’ s rapid economic development , as the government has placed more emphasis on the latter .
however , there is proof that economic development can co-exist with environmentally-friendly production and china , too , is striving towards this .

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .
figures reveal a lower proportion of homeless people in eastern germany , a fact attributed to a greater number of vacant properties in that part of the country. rc / epd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "

france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .
in 2007 , china surpassed germany to become the world 's third largest economy behind the us and japan , and in 2010 , it is expected to climb to the number two spot .
slow recovery germany 's dethronement from top exporter status comes as analysts predict a slow economic recovery for the country .
the bdi federation of german industries said in its latest foreign trade report that its export sector would n't return to pre-crisis levels until 2014 .
" germany 's export industries are on the road to improvement , but the recovery process will take longer , " bdi president hans-peter keitel wrote in his introduction to the report .
" the export industries had to battle through a tough setback in 2009 . "
in the first 10 months of 2009 , germany 's exports fell 27.4 percent , compared with 20.4 percent for china and 21.4 percent for the us .
china has recently come under harsh criticism from both europe and the us for allegedly failing to comply with global trade rules. vj / dpa / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 07.01.2010 top german magazine trades models for " real " women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte 's first model-free issue hit newsstands - but can you see the change ?
germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .
end to fight against tax havens ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization activicts say germany needs to to " dry out " tax havens germany 's new stance on tax havens follows the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- removal of all countries - including belgium , luxemburg and switzerland - from its " gray list " of uncooperative tax havens .
the oecd said the nations had made sufficient commitments to implement oecd standards of " transparency and the exchange of information . "
still , joachim poss , deputy leader of the social democrats - germany 's largest opposition party - told the daily tageszeitung that the finance ministry 's findings were inappropriate .
" this is comparable to simply scrapping the law passed in september .
the new finance ministry , the new government , is simply fulfilling the wishes of the economy , which massively financed its political campaign , " he said .
green party economic expert gerhard schick said finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was " effectively ending the fight against tax evasion in germany . "
schaeuble , meanwhile , in an interview with the german branch of the ap news agency , called on the oecd to enforce the standards of transparency with which suspected tax havens have agreed to comply .
" it is absolutely necessary that -lsb- the oecd -rsb- implement and monitor the standards these nations have agreed to , " he said. glb / apd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .

while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .

slovakia 's border police chief has taken responsibilty for the gaff . slovak police responsible for a botched security test that sent explosives to ireland in the luggage of an unsuspecting danube wings passenger have apologized for the fiasco . the chief of the slovak border police , tibor mako , stepped down on thursday after apologizing for a blunder in security training that resulted in 90 grams -lrb- 3.17 ounces -rrb- of explosives being transported in a passenger 's baggage to dublin . the training exercise , which took place on saturday , was intended to test the ability of bomb-sniffing dogs to find explosives at poprad airport in northeastern slovakia . slovak border police inserted test packages containing small amounts of explosives into selected passengers ' luggage without their knowledge .
forgetful officer chief mako said the package was successfully detected , but a police officer " forgot to remove the explosives after a dog found them during a security test . " " the explosives were attached by accident to the backpack .
we are sorry that a good effort to test the security of civilian air transport turned out so badly , " mako told reporters . mako said the police officer failed to inform his superiors and only told poprad airport , which in turn sent dublin airport a telex message .
unwitting traveller interrogated however , dublin airport authority said in a statement that it had " no contact whatsoever " from the slovak side until tuesday . the 49-year-old slovak backpack owner - who has worked in ireland for three years and was returning from a christmas holiday in slovakia - was arrested under anti-terrorist laws tuesday and interrogated .
he was released without charge later that day . the blunder took place a week and a half after a nigerian man allegedly attempting to detonate explosives aboard a jetliner headed for detroit , michigan .
airport security staff in nigeria and the netherlands apparently failed to detect the man was carrying explosives . gmb / rc / smh / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain , which currently holds the eu presidency , has called for a common policy over using body scanners that takes concerns about privacy into account . the spanish eu presidency has called for a common european position on airport body scanners after member states clashed over the introduction of new security technology .
spanish transport minister jose blanco lopez made his appeal after eu experts met on thursday to discuss the proposed measure .
a number of eu countries , including spain , are unhappy about possible privacy issues relating to the scanners , which can " see through " clothing to create three-dimensional images of passengers .
lopez said that a common approach to security would be more sensible than member states taking unilateral measures .
britain and italy have decided to install the devices , while the netherlands will increase the number in use from 15 to 60 .
" it 's better for europe to have a common position because it makes no sense for european passengers to travel from london to madrid and back and have different controls , " said lopez .
" a common position would be better for all of us , even if it was n't binding , " he said .
sparked by bomb attempt the question of new security measures arose after nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab was charged with trying to blow up a us-bound jet from amsterdam on december 25 .
" we should not react hastily and assume that full body scanners are the best security measure , " said lopez .
" we have to find the right balance between security and respect for freedoms and privacy . "
the european commission said that there had been " an exchange of views " over the technology and that " an initiative " on employing it , which had previously been blocked , was being reconsidered .
" if there are no problems with human rights , health , the freedom of citizens and data use , i can not exclude that the commission could re-open the question of body scanners , " eu transport commissioner antonio tajani said. rc / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 07.01.2010 places still up for grabs on germany 's world cup plane to south africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew has a lot on his mind as the world cup nears germany coach joachim loew is still deliberating over who he will take to south africa this summer .
some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.01.2010 further case of industrial poisoning in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child with lead poisoning receives treatment at a hospital in china china ’ s state-owned news agency , xinhua , reported on thursday that 150 people had tested positive for mercury poisoning .
they are workers employed by the foshan electrical and lighting factory in guangdong province .
just two days previously , over 50 children were reported to have lead poisoning in the jiangsu province . china is often criticised for its sub-standard safety practices inside factories and out .
in the latest reported case of mercury poisoning , a spokesperson stated that many workers could not be bothered to wear a mask when working with liquid mercury .
professor michael lentze from one of germany ’ s poison control centres pointed out that this could be quite hazardous and explained that people could be poisoned by inhaling steamed mercury .
“ workers working at an industrial plant where liquid mercury goes into the air are bound to inhale mercury and get poisoned if they do not have a mask on , ” he said .
he added that mercury could also get into the body by consuming water that had been contaminated by industrial waste or even by eating shell fish , as many pollutants ended up in the ocean .
poisoning affects the kidneys and the brain poisoning is known to have serious effects on the body and “ affects particularly the kidneys and the brain , and can therefore have neurological symptoms , ” lentze said .
heavy metal poisoning is nothing new in china .
since august 2009 , 3,000 children have been reported as having lead poisoning .
on top of that , at the end of november , over a thousand families in shaanxi province had to be relocated because they lived near a lead smelter that caused cases of poisoning .
lead is used in colouring agents for ceramic products and also in some foods , which can cause organic lead poisoning .
there is also inorganic lead poisoning , which is caused by gasoline containing lead compounds .
it gets into the body by being inhaled or defused through the skin .
“ lead is poisonous for the organs in the body .
it is poisonous for the brain , for the heart , for the liver and the kidneys , ” professor lentze explained .
heavy metal poisoning can also cause agitation , memory loss and brain damage .
there are treatments which rid the body of the compounds , if the poisoning is detected on time but prevention is , of course , far better than treatment .
some endeavours to clean up the environment “ what we ’ ve seen over the past couple of decades is that china - the industrial centre for the world in terms of production of cheap goods - has produced a lot of environmental problems , ” explained wwf country director for china , dermot o ’ gorman .
“ these are visible not only in water pollution and other pollution problems .
i think that we are seeing at the moment endeavours by the central government to clean up the environment but i think there are still a number of challenges at a provincial level of putting environmental legislation and protection into place . ”
china ’ s environment has suffered greatly under the country ’ s rapid economic development , as the government has placed more emphasis on the latter .
however , there is proof that economic development can co-exist with environmentally-friendly production and china , too , is striving towards this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 07.01.2010 places still up for grabs on germany 's world cup plane to south africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew has a lot on his mind as the world cup nears germany coach joachim loew is still deliberating over who he will take to south africa this summer .
some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

the error could cost upwards of 240 million euros if they are forced to issue replacements . german banks have been inundated with customer complaints after a software glitch rendered millions of checking and credit cards unusable in a variety of cash terminals in the new year , a bank spokesman said on wednesday . the banks are hoping software experts will be able to develop a program capable of instantly re-programming the faulty cards ' microchips when they are inserted in an automated teller machine -lrb- atm -rrb- . if that does n't work , banks may be forced to spend as much as 240 million euros to replace all 30 million cards containing a new anti-fraud microchip that does not recognize the year 2010 . the zka national credit panel said banks will make a final decision on what action to take within the next few days .
it 's a problem that nobody saw coming , according to thomas schlueter from the association of german banks . " it could be that these cards were already on the market for years so they were working fine from 2008 to 2009 for instance .
but they had a problem with the figure 2010 , and i think that was a problem that nobody was really aware of , " schlueter told deutsche welle . problem not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many faulty-card holders were forced to pay for items in cash only banks using the french card supplier gemalto were affected by the software glitch , and of the 30 million cards issued , only a fraction actually encountered problems . gemalto said it was working with its german clients to develop " a corrective process that avoids the replacement of the affected cards . " according to zka , only one batch of the microchips was causing problems .
the new anti-fraud technology in the chips was created by emvco . meanwhile , banks have been blamed for not providing their clients with enough information . " the banks ' handling of this has been disastrous , " banking expert manfred westphal told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" i need to know as a bank customer , first : does this problem affect my own card , and if so , exactly which functions are affected ? " " the banks do not tell you .
and so many germans will now go on their winter holiday to switzerland , for example , and find that they can not obtain any money with their atm cards , " westphal said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks affected by the software glitch plan to come up with a solution by next week retailers concerned there has also been some concern about how the system failure will affect the broader economy , as many people are unable to withdraw cash or pay at the till .
some have even had their cards ' eaten ' by the automated teller machine after the faulty software determined they had expired . now the german retail industry is calling on banks to compensate traders for lost earnings . " we have angered customers and lost revenues through no fault of our own , " stefan genth , head of the association of german retailers , said on wednesday . in total , about 20 percent of one-million retail point-of-sale terminals were affected by the glitch that officials say is similar to the " y2k bug " that triggered concerns at the turn of the century . exact figures as to just how much damage this latest fault has inflicted on shopkeepers are not yet available . however , schlueter believes any harm to retailers was miniscule .
" most of the systems that are running in the retail sector are still using the magnetic stripe -lrb- as opposed to the microchip -rrb- .
so we have still got these on the cards as a fall back system , " he said . the banks worst hit by the glitch were germany 's dominant public-sector savings banks and cooperative banks , but client of private lenders such as postbank and commerzbank also reported problems . author : vanessa johnston editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first satellite should be delivered in june 2012 , with an additional one to be completed every six weeks until march 2014 .

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "

spain , which currently holds the eu presidency , has called for a common policy over using body scanners that takes concerns about privacy into account . the spanish eu presidency has called for a common european position on airport body scanners after member states clashed over the introduction of new security technology .
spanish transport minister jose blanco lopez made his appeal after eu experts met on thursday to discuss the proposed measure .
a number of eu countries , including spain , are unhappy about possible privacy issues relating to the scanners , which can " see through " clothing to create three-dimensional images of passengers .
lopez said that a common approach to security would be more sensible than member states taking unilateral measures .
britain and italy have decided to install the devices , while the netherlands will increase the number in use from 15 to 60 .
" it 's better for europe to have a common position because it makes no sense for european passengers to travel from london to madrid and back and have different controls , " said lopez .
" a common position would be better for all of us , even if it was n't binding , " he said .
sparked by bomb attempt the question of new security measures arose after nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab was charged with trying to blow up a us-bound jet from amsterdam on december 25 .
" we should not react hastily and assume that full body scanners are the best security measure , " said lopez .
" we have to find the right balance between security and respect for freedoms and privacy . "
the european commission said that there had been " an exchange of views " over the technology and that " an initiative " on employing it , which had previously been blocked , was being reconsidered .

czech authorities have reached a consensus - and the answer is probably more than you think ! move over , amsterdam !
the czech republic has usurped the netherlands as the european country with the most lenient drug laws .
on december 14 , czech prime minister jan fischer 's government approved new standardized limits to clarify the acceptable levels for personal drug use .
under the new law , which took effect january 1 , a person may possess up to four tablets of ecstasy , 15 grams of marijuana , 1.5 grams of heroin , or one gram of cocaine , without facing criminal charges .
czech authorities have been quick to point out that the recently introduced limits do not constitute a change in the law , but rather serve as a clearer definition for law enforcement officials .
police previously relied on the ambiguous term " a small amount " as the dividing line between misdemeanor and felony prosecution .
under the new law , a person possessing less than the specified amount may still be charged with a misdemeanor - meaning he can be fined , but not jailed , for the offense .
the new levels are by far the most liberal in europe .
the quantities of heroin and marijuana permitted represent nearly three times the amounts allowed under dutch law , while in neighboring hungary , drug possession in any amount is potentially punishable by prison sentence. smh / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the error could cost upwards of 240 million euros if they are forced to issue replacements . german banks have been inundated with customer complaints after a software glitch rendered millions of checking and credit cards unusable in a variety of cash terminals in the new year , a bank spokesman said on wednesday . the banks are hoping software experts will be able to develop a program capable of instantly re-programming the faulty cards ' microchips when they are inserted in an automated teller machine -lrb- atm -rrb- . if that does n't work , banks may be forced to spend as much as 240 million euros to replace all 30 million cards containing a new anti-fraud microchip that does not recognize the year 2010 . the zka national credit panel said banks will make a final decision on what action to take within the next few days .
it 's a problem that nobody saw coming , according to thomas schlueter from the association of german banks . " it could be that these cards were already on the market for years so they were working fine from 2008 to 2009 for instance .
but they had a problem with the figure 2010 , and i think that was a problem that nobody was really aware of , " schlueter told deutsche welle . problem not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many faulty-card holders were forced to pay for items in cash only banks using the french card supplier gemalto were affected by the software glitch , and of the 30 million cards issued , only a fraction actually encountered problems . gemalto said it was working with its german clients to develop " a corrective process that avoids the replacement of the affected cards . " according to zka , only one batch of the microchips was causing problems .
the new anti-fraud technology in the chips was created by emvco . meanwhile , banks have been blamed for not providing their clients with enough information . " the banks ' handling of this has been disastrous , " banking expert manfred westphal told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" i need to know as a bank customer , first : does this problem affect my own card , and if so , exactly which functions are affected ? " " the banks do not tell you .
and so many germans will now go on their winter holiday to switzerland , for example , and find that they can not obtain any money with their atm cards , " westphal said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks affected by the software glitch plan to come up with a solution by next week retailers concerned there has also been some concern about how the system failure will affect the broader economy , as many people are unable to withdraw cash or pay at the till .
some have even had their cards ' eaten ' by the automated teller machine after the faulty software determined they had expired . now the german retail industry is calling on banks to compensate traders for lost earnings . " we have angered customers and lost revenues through no fault of our own , " stefan genth , head of the association of german retailers , said on wednesday . in total , about 20 percent of one-million retail point-of-sale terminals were affected by the glitch that officials say is similar to the " y2k bug " that triggered concerns at the turn of the century . exact figures as to just how much damage this latest fault has inflicted on shopkeepers are not yet available . however , schlueter believes any harm to retailers was miniscule .
" most of the systems that are running in the retail sector are still using the magnetic stripe -lrb- as opposed to the microchip -rrb- .
so we have still got these on the cards as a fall back system , " he said . the banks worst hit by the glitch were germany 's dominant public-sector savings banks and cooperative banks , but client of private lenders such as postbank and commerzbank also reported problems . author : vanessa johnston editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .
in 2007 , china surpassed germany to become the world 's third largest economy behind the us and japan , and in 2010 , it is expected to climb to the number two spot .

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

forgetful officer chief mako said the package was successfully detected , but a police officer " forgot to remove the explosives after a dog found them during a security test . " " the explosives were attached by accident to the backpack .
we are sorry that a good effort to test the security of civilian air transport turned out so badly , " mako told reporters . mako said the police officer failed to inform his superiors and only told poprad airport , which in turn sent dublin airport a telex message .
unwitting traveller interrogated however , dublin airport authority said in a statement that it had " no contact whatsoever " from the slovak side until tuesday . the 49-year-old slovak backpack owner - who has worked in ireland for three years and was returning from a christmas holiday in slovakia - was arrested under anti-terrorist laws tuesday and interrogated .
he was released without charge later that day . the blunder took place a week and a half after a nigerian man allegedly attempting to detonate explosives aboard a jetliner headed for detroit , michigan .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 07.01.2010 top german magazine trades models for " real " women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte 's first model-free issue hit newsstands - but can you see the change ?
germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's christian social union , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey in an attempt to withhold full membership from the majority muslim nation .
in his two days in turkey , westerwelle is to meet with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , as well as turkish foreign ministry officials .
on friday , westerwelle will move on to saudi arabia , qatar and the united arab emirates , where he will be accompanied by a contingent of german business leaders eager to press their case for increased financial ties with the gulf states .
the middle east conflict is also expected to be raised during the foreign minister 's talks , as are recent developments in iran and yemen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 07.01.2010 top german magazine trades models for " real " women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte 's first model-free issue hit newsstands - but can you see the change ?
germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant .

slovakia 's border police chief has taken responsibilty for the gaff . slovak police responsible for a botched security test that sent explosives to ireland in the luggage of an unsuspecting danube wings passenger have apologized for the fiasco . the chief of the slovak border police , tibor mako , stepped down on thursday after apologizing for a blunder in security training that resulted in 90 grams -lrb- 3.17 ounces -rrb- of explosives being transported in a passenger 's baggage to dublin . the training exercise , which took place on saturday , was intended to test the ability of bomb-sniffing dogs to find explosives at poprad airport in northeastern slovakia . slovak border police inserted test packages containing small amounts of explosives into selected passengers ' luggage without their knowledge .
forgetful officer chief mako said the package was successfully detected , but a police officer " forgot to remove the explosives after a dog found them during a security test . " " the explosives were attached by accident to the backpack .

ankara 's bid to join the eu could be high on the agenda . german foreign minister guido westerwelle touched down in turkey late on wednesday for high-level talks with officials in ankara .
the leader of germany 's junior coalition partners , the free democrats , will then travel to the persian gulf .
in ankara , turkish officials are expected to broach the topic of their country 's efforts to join the european union .
in recent months , several balkan states have seen progress in their eu membership applications , while turkey continues to experience delays in its own accession to the 27-nation bloc .
westerwelle has praised ankara for reforms it has made in its attempt to satisfy certain eu membership criteria but also reminded the country of 74 million that further progress was necessary .
germany 's christian social union , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey in an attempt to withhold full membership from the majority muslim nation .
in his two days in turkey , westerwelle is to meet with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , as well as turkish foreign ministry officials .
on friday , westerwelle will move on to saudi arabia , qatar and the united arab emirates , where he will be accompanied by a contingent of german business leaders eager to press their case for increased financial ties with the gulf states .
the middle east conflict is also expected to be raised during the foreign minister 's talks , as are recent developments in iran and yemen .
the six-day trip will be westerwelle 's second to the region since assuming the role of foreign minister in october .
in november , he led a delegation to israel and the palestinian territories. dfm / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .
end to fight against tax havens ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization activicts say germany needs to to " dry out " tax havens germany 's new stance on tax havens follows the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- removal of all countries - including belgium , luxemburg and switzerland - from its " gray list " of uncooperative tax havens .
the oecd said the nations had made sufficient commitments to implement oecd standards of " transparency and the exchange of information . "
still , joachim poss , deputy leader of the social democrats - germany 's largest opposition party - told the daily tageszeitung that the finance ministry 's findings were inappropriate .
" this is comparable to simply scrapping the law passed in september .
the new finance ministry , the new government , is simply fulfilling the wishes of the economy , which massively financed its political campaign , " he said .
green party economic expert gerhard schick said finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was " effectively ending the fight against tax evasion in germany . "
schaeuble , meanwhile , in an interview with the german branch of the ap news agency , called on the oecd to enforce the standards of transparency with which suspected tax havens have agreed to comply .
" it is absolutely necessary that -lsb- the oecd -rsb- implement and monitor the standards these nations have agreed to , " he said. glb / apd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .

the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 07.01.2010 france considering tax on internet advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google and other internet giants would be hit by the tax the french government is considering taxing advertising revenues from internet corporations like google .
the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the error could cost upwards of 240 million euros if they are forced to issue replacements . german banks have been inundated with customer complaints after a software glitch rendered millions of checking and credit cards unusable in a variety of cash terminals in the new year , a bank spokesman said on wednesday . the banks are hoping software experts will be able to develop a program capable of instantly re-programming the faulty cards ' microchips when they are inserted in an automated teller machine -lrb- atm -rrb- . if that does n't work , banks may be forced to spend as much as 240 million euros to replace all 30 million cards containing a new anti-fraud microchip that does not recognize the year 2010 . the zka national credit panel said banks will make a final decision on what action to take within the next few days .
it 's a problem that nobody saw coming , according to thomas schlueter from the association of german banks . " it could be that these cards were already on the market for years so they were working fine from 2008 to 2009 for instance .

" according to zka , only one batch of the microchips was causing problems .

paris says that in order to be fair to new french citizens , it must be firm with those who do not follow the rules . france expelled more than 29,000 illegal immigrants last year , exceeding government targets . the figure , announced by immigration minister eric besson , is 2,000 more than a target set by french president nicolas sarkozy .
about 175,000 illegal immigrants had initially arrived in france on long-term visas during 2009 , according to government figures .
in the same period , besson told france 's europe 1 radio station , 108,000 foreigners were given french nationality .
policy " must be firm " besson reiterated that french policy on immigration was " firm and fair . "
he said that foreigners who settled legally were welcome and given help to integrate by learning the language as well as finding employment and accommodation . " therefore , " said besson , " we must deport those who enter illegally . "
among the deportations were the controversial repatriations of 12 afghans , who were sent back to their home country on planes chartered with britain .
besson , who was criticized for the deportations to afghanistan , pointed out that britain deported 1,000 afghans during 2009. rc / afp / reuters / kna editor .

spain , which currently holds the eu presidency , has called for a common policy over using body scanners that takes concerns about privacy into account . the spanish eu presidency has called for a common european position on airport body scanners after member states clashed over the introduction of new security technology .
spanish transport minister jose blanco lopez made his appeal after eu experts met on thursday to discuss the proposed measure .
a number of eu countries , including spain , are unhappy about possible privacy issues relating to the scanners , which can " see through " clothing to create three-dimensional images of passengers .
lopez said that a common approach to security would be more sensible than member states taking unilateral measures .
britain and italy have decided to install the devices , while the netherlands will increase the number in use from 15 to 60 .
" it 's better for europe to have a common position because it makes no sense for european passengers to travel from london to madrid and back and have different controls , " said lopez .
" a common position would be better for all of us , even if it was n't binding , " he said .
sparked by bomb attempt the question of new security measures arose after nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab was charged with trying to blow up a us-bound jet from amsterdam on december 25 .
" we should not react hastily and assume that full body scanners are the best security measure , " said lopez .
" we have to find the right balance between security and respect for freedoms and privacy . "
the european commission said that there had been " an exchange of views " over the technology and that " an initiative " on employing it , which had previously been blocked , was being reconsidered .
" if there are no problems with human rights , health , the freedom of citizens and data use , i can not exclude that the commission could re-open the question of body scanners , " eu transport commissioner antonio tajani said. rc / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ankara 's bid to join the eu could be high on the agenda . german foreign minister guido westerwelle touched down in turkey late on wednesday for high-level talks with officials in ankara .

in ankara , turkish officials are expected to broach the topic of their country 's efforts to join the european union .
in recent months , several balkan states have seen progress in their eu membership applications , while turkey continues to experience delays in its own accession to the 27-nation bloc .
westerwelle has praised ankara for reforms it has made in its attempt to satisfy certain eu membership criteria but also reminded the country of 74 million that further progress was necessary .
germany 's christian social union , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey in an attempt to withhold full membership from the majority muslim nation .
in his two days in turkey , westerwelle is to meet with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , as well as turkish foreign ministry officials .
on friday , westerwelle will move on to saudi arabia , qatar and the united arab emirates , where he will be accompanied by a contingent of german business leaders eager to press their case for increased financial ties with the gulf states .
the middle east conflict is also expected to be raised during the foreign minister 's talks , as are recent developments in iran and yemen .
the six-day trip will be westerwelle 's second to the region since assuming the role of foreign minister in october .
in november , he led a delegation to israel and the palestinian territories. dfm / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forgetful officer chief mako said the package was successfully detected , but a police officer " forgot to remove the explosives after a dog found them during a security test . " " the explosives were attached by accident to the backpack .
we are sorry that a good effort to test the security of civilian air transport turned out so badly , " mako told reporters . mako said the police officer failed to inform his superiors and only told poprad airport , which in turn sent dublin airport a telex message .

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .
figures reveal a lower proportion of homeless people in eastern germany , a fact attributed to a greater number of vacant properties in that part of the country. rc / epd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech authorities have reached a consensus - and the answer is probably more than you think ! move over , amsterdam !
the czech republic has usurped the netherlands as the european country with the most lenient drug laws .
on december 14 , czech prime minister jan fischer 's government approved new standardized limits to clarify the acceptable levels for personal drug use .
under the new law , which took effect january 1 , a person may possess up to four tablets of ecstasy , 15 grams of marijuana , 1.5 grams of heroin , or one gram of cocaine , without facing criminal charges .
czech authorities have been quick to point out that the recently introduced limits do not constitute a change in the law , but rather serve as a clearer definition for law enforcement officials .
police previously relied on the ambiguous term " a small amount " as the dividing line between misdemeanor and felony prosecution .
under the new law , a person possessing less than the specified amount may still be charged with a misdemeanor - meaning he can be fined , but not jailed , for the offense .
the new levels are by far the most liberal in europe .
the quantities of heroin and marijuana permitted represent nearly three times the amounts allowed under dutch law , while in neighboring hungary , drug possession in any amount is potentially punishable by prison sentence. smh / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 07.01.2010 top german magazine trades models for " real " women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte 's first model-free issue hit newsstands - but can you see the change ?
germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

ankara 's bid to join the eu could be high on the agenda . german foreign minister guido westerwelle touched down in turkey late on wednesday for high-level talks with officials in ankara .

in ankara , turkish officials are expected to broach the topic of their country 's efforts to join the european union .
in recent months , several balkan states have seen progress in their eu membership applications , while turkey continues to experience delays in its own accession to the 27-nation bloc .
westerwelle has praised ankara for reforms it has made in its attempt to satisfy certain eu membership criteria but also reminded the country of 74 million that further progress was necessary .
germany 's christian social union , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey in an attempt to withhold full membership from the majority muslim nation .
in his two days in turkey , westerwelle is to meet with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , as well as turkish foreign ministry officials .
on friday , westerwelle will move on to saudi arabia , qatar and the united arab emirates , where he will be accompanied by a contingent of german business leaders eager to press their case for increased financial ties with the gulf states .

the error could cost upwards of 240 million euros if they are forced to issue replacements . german banks have been inundated with customer complaints after a software glitch rendered millions of checking and credit cards unusable in a variety of cash terminals in the new year , a bank spokesman said on wednesday . the banks are hoping software experts will be able to develop a program capable of instantly re-programming the faulty cards ' microchips when they are inserted in an automated teller machine -lrb- atm -rrb- . if that does n't work , banks may be forced to spend as much as 240 million euros to replace all 30 million cards containing a new anti-fraud microchip that does not recognize the year 2010 . the zka national credit panel said banks will make a final decision on what action to take within the next few days .
it 's a problem that nobody saw coming , according to thomas schlueter from the association of german banks . " it could be that these cards were already on the market for years so they were working fine from 2008 to 2009 for instance .
but they had a problem with the figure 2010 , and i think that was a problem that nobody was really aware of , " schlueter told deutsche welle . problem not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many faulty-card holders were forced to pay for items in cash only banks using the french card supplier gemalto were affected by the software glitch , and of the 30 million cards issued , only a fraction actually encountered problems . gemalto said it was working with its german clients to develop " a corrective process that avoids the replacement of the affected cards . " according to zka , only one batch of the microchips was causing problems .
the new anti-fraud technology in the chips was created by emvco . meanwhile , banks have been blamed for not providing their clients with enough information . " the banks ' handling of this has been disastrous , " banking expert manfred westphal told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" i need to know as a bank customer , first : does this problem affect my own card , and if so , exactly which functions are affected ? " " the banks do not tell you .
and so many germans will now go on their winter holiday to switzerland , for example , and find that they can not obtain any money with their atm cards , " westphal said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks affected by the software glitch plan to come up with a solution by next week retailers concerned there has also been some concern about how the system failure will affect the broader economy , as many people are unable to withdraw cash or pay at the till .
some have even had their cards ' eaten ' by the automated teller machine after the faulty software determined they had expired . now the german retail industry is calling on banks to compensate traders for lost earnings . " we have angered customers and lost revenues through no fault of our own , " stefan genth , head of the association of german retailers , said on wednesday . in total , about 20 percent of one-million retail point-of-sale terminals were affected by the glitch that officials say is similar to the " y2k bug " that triggered concerns at the turn of the century . exact figures as to just how much damage this latest fault has inflicted on shopkeepers are not yet available . however , schlueter believes any harm to retailers was miniscule .
" most of the systems that are running in the retail sector are still using the magnetic stripe -lrb- as opposed to the microchip -rrb- .
so we have still got these on the cards as a fall back system , " he said . the banks worst hit by the glitch were germany 's dominant public-sector savings banks and cooperative banks , but client of private lenders such as postbank and commerzbank also reported problems . author : vanessa johnston editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

ankara 's bid to join the eu could be high on the agenda . german foreign minister guido westerwelle touched down in turkey late on wednesday for high-level talks with officials in ankara .
the leader of germany 's junior coalition partners , the free democrats , will then travel to the persian gulf .
in ankara , turkish officials are expected to broach the topic of their country 's efforts to join the european union .
in recent months , several balkan states have seen progress in their eu membership applications , while turkey continues to experience delays in its own accession to the 27-nation bloc .
westerwelle has praised ankara for reforms it has made in its attempt to satisfy certain eu membership criteria but also reminded the country of 74 million that further progress was necessary .
germany 's christian social union , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey in an attempt to withhold full membership from the majority muslim nation .
in his two days in turkey , westerwelle is to meet with turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , as well as turkish foreign ministry officials .
on friday , westerwelle will move on to saudi arabia , qatar and the united arab emirates , where he will be accompanied by a contingent of german business leaders eager to press their case for increased financial ties with the gulf states .
the middle east conflict is also expected to be raised during the foreign minister 's talks , as are recent developments in iran and yemen .

czech authorities have reached a consensus - and the answer is probably more than you think ! move over , amsterdam !
the czech republic has usurped the netherlands as the european country with the most lenient drug laws .
on december 14 , czech prime minister jan fischer 's government approved new standardized limits to clarify the acceptable levels for personal drug use .
under the new law , which took effect january 1 , a person may possess up to four tablets of ecstasy , 15 grams of marijuana , 1.5 grams of heroin , or one gram of cocaine , without facing criminal charges .
czech authorities have been quick to point out that the recently introduced limits do not constitute a change in the law , but rather serve as a clearer definition for law enforcement officials .
police previously relied on the ambiguous term " a small amount " as the dividing line between misdemeanor and felony prosecution .
under the new law , a person possessing less than the specified amount may still be charged with a misdemeanor - meaning he can be fined , but not jailed , for the offense .
the new levels are by far the most liberal in europe .
the quantities of heroin and marijuana permitted represent nearly three times the amounts allowed under dutch law , while in neighboring hungary , drug possession in any amount is potentially punishable by prison sentence. smh / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .

spain , which currently holds the eu presidency , has called for a common policy over using body scanners that takes concerns about privacy into account . the spanish eu presidency has called for a common european position on airport body scanners after member states clashed over the introduction of new security technology .
spanish transport minister jose blanco lopez made his appeal after eu experts met on thursday to discuss the proposed measure .
a number of eu countries , including spain , are unhappy about possible privacy issues relating to the scanners , which can " see through " clothing to create three-dimensional images of passengers .
lopez said that a common approach to security would be more sensible than member states taking unilateral measures .
britain and italy have decided to install the devices , while the netherlands will increase the number in use from 15 to 60 .
" it 's better for europe to have a common position because it makes no sense for european passengers to travel from london to madrid and back and have different controls , " said lopez .
" a common position would be better for all of us , even if it was n't binding , " he said .
sparked by bomb attempt the question of new security measures arose after nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab was charged with trying to blow up a us-bound jet from amsterdam on december 25 .
" we should not react hastily and assume that full body scanners are the best security measure , " said lopez .
" we have to find the right balance between security and respect for freedoms and privacy . "
the european commission said that there had been " an exchange of views " over the technology and that " an initiative " on employing it , which had previously been blocked , was being reconsidered .
" if there are no problems with human rights , health , the freedom of citizens and data use , i can not exclude that the commission could re-open the question of body scanners , " eu transport commissioner antonio tajani said. rc / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .
end to fight against tax havens ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization activicts say germany needs to to " dry out " tax havens germany 's new stance on tax havens follows the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- removal of all countries - including belgium , luxemburg and switzerland - from its " gray list " of uncooperative tax havens .
the oecd said the nations had made sufficient commitments to implement oecd standards of " transparency and the exchange of information . "
still , joachim poss , deputy leader of the social democrats - germany 's largest opposition party - told the daily tageszeitung that the finance ministry 's findings were inappropriate .
" this is comparable to simply scrapping the law passed in september .
the new finance ministry , the new government , is simply fulfilling the wishes of the economy , which massively financed its political campaign , " he said .
green party economic expert gerhard schick said finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was " effectively ending the fight against tax evasion in germany . "
schaeuble , meanwhile , in an interview with the german branch of the ap news agency , called on the oecd to enforce the standards of transparency with which suspected tax havens have agreed to comply .
" it is absolutely necessary that -lsb- the oecd -rsb- implement and monitor the standards these nations have agreed to , " he said. glb / apd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 07.01.2010 places still up for grabs on germany 's world cup plane to south africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew has a lot on his mind as the world cup nears germany coach joachim loew is still deliberating over who he will take to south africa this summer .
some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 07.01.2010 places still up for grabs on germany 's world cup plane to south africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew has a lot on his mind as the world cup nears germany coach joachim loew is still deliberating over who he will take to south africa this summer .
some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .

german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .

he has stressed the need for reforms in the country . on his first trip to the turkish capital , foreign minister westerwelle told an audience of turkish diplomats that he believed that turkey was not yet ready for eu membership .
" we all know that freedom of opinion , of the press and of religion are pillars of the values of our european community , " the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said , before adding that the " work of reform in turkey on its path to europe is not yet complete .
i want to encourage you to continue . "
but he promised that germany would honor its agreements on turkey 's entry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been negotiating for eu membership since 2005 not a tourist in shorts westerwelle pointed to the government 's coalition contract , which promised to engage in eu membership negotiations with an attitude that was " open to any result .

on being asked whether he spoke for the whole government , westerwelle said , " i 'm not here as a tourist in shorts , but as the german foreign minister .
what i say , counts . "
westerwelle 's opposite number ahmut davutoglu responded positively to the german foreign minister 's speech , and said that turkey would do whatever it takes to gain entry to the eu .
" we want to fulfil all reforms .
everything that this process requires , we will do - especially in relation to germany . "

csu general secretary alexander dobrindt said , " i can only advise him not to come to secret agreements in turkey , as he did in poland , that we then have to clear up for weeks afterwards in the coalition . "
but in an exchange that further exacerbated tensions within the coalition government , the fdp 's minister of state werner hoyer rejected dobrindt 's statement and accused the csu of undermining the coalition contract and trying to draw attention to itself. bk / dpa / apd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 07.01.2010 france considering tax on internet advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google and other internet giants would be hit by the tax the french government is considering taxing advertising revenues from internet corporations like google .
the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 07.01.2010 france considering tax on internet advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google and other internet giants would be hit by the tax the french government is considering taxing advertising revenues from internet corporations like google .
the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

slovakia 's border police chief has taken responsibilty for the gaff . slovak police responsible for a botched security test that sent explosives to ireland in the luggage of an unsuspecting danube wings passenger have apologized for the fiasco . the chief of the slovak border police , tibor mako , stepped down on thursday after apologizing for a blunder in security training that resulted in 90 grams -lrb- 3.17 ounces -rrb- of explosives being transported in a passenger 's baggage to dublin . the training exercise , which took place on saturday , was intended to test the ability of bomb-sniffing dogs to find explosives at poprad airport in northeastern slovakia . slovak border police inserted test packages containing small amounts of explosives into selected passengers ' luggage without their knowledge .
forgetful officer chief mako said the package was successfully detected , but a police officer " forgot to remove the explosives after a dog found them during a security test . " " the explosives were attached by accident to the backpack .
we are sorry that a good effort to test the security of civilian air transport turned out so badly , " mako told reporters . mako said the police officer failed to inform his superiors and only told poprad airport , which in turn sent dublin airport a telex message .
unwitting traveller interrogated however , dublin airport authority said in a statement that it had " no contact whatsoever " from the slovak side until tuesday . the 49-year-old slovak backpack owner - who has worked in ireland for three years and was returning from a christmas holiday in slovakia - was arrested under anti-terrorist laws tuesday and interrogated .
he was released without charge later that day . the blunder took place a week and a half after a nigerian man allegedly attempting to detonate explosives aboard a jetliner headed for detroit , michigan .
airport security staff in nigeria and the netherlands apparently failed to detect the man was carrying explosives . gmb / rc / smh / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .

former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .

german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .

but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .
in 2007 , china surpassed germany to become the world 's third largest economy behind the us and japan , and in 2010 , it is expected to climb to the number two spot .

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .
in 2007 , china surpassed germany to become the world 's third largest economy behind the us and japan , and in 2010 , it is expected to climb to the number two spot .
slow recovery germany 's dethronement from top exporter status comes as analysts predict a slow economic recovery for the country .

" germany 's export industries are on the road to improvement , but the recovery process will take longer , " bdi president hans-peter keitel wrote in his introduction to the report .
" the export industries had to battle through a tough setback in 2009 . "
in the first 10 months of 2009 , germany 's exports fell 27.4 percent , compared with 20.4 percent for china and 21.4 percent for the us .

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .

czech authorities have reached a consensus - and the answer is probably more than you think ! move over , amsterdam !
the czech republic has usurped the netherlands as the european country with the most lenient drug laws .
on december 14 , czech prime minister jan fischer 's government approved new standardized limits to clarify the acceptable levels for personal drug use .
under the new law , which took effect january 1 , a person may possess up to four tablets of ecstasy , 15 grams of marijuana , 1.5 grams of heroin , or one gram of cocaine , without facing criminal charges .
czech authorities have been quick to point out that the recently introduced limits do not constitute a change in the law , but rather serve as a clearer definition for law enforcement officials .
police previously relied on the ambiguous term " a small amount " as the dividing line between misdemeanor and felony prosecution .
under the new law , a person possessing less than the specified amount may still be charged with a misdemeanor - meaning he can be fined , but not jailed , for the offense .
the new levels are by far the most liberal in europe .
the quantities of heroin and marijuana permitted represent nearly three times the amounts allowed under dutch law , while in neighboring hungary , drug possession in any amount is potentially punishable by prison sentence. smh / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .
figures reveal a lower proportion of homeless people in eastern germany , a fact attributed to a greater number of vacant properties in that part of the country. rc / epd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal follows complaints from smaller web sites that the giants are profiting from their content . france could start taxing internet advertising revenues from online giants such as google , using the funds to support creative industries that have been hit by the digital revolution , a french newspaper reported on thursday .
the proposal is one of several put forward in a government-commissioned survey , and continues france 's tradition of tight legislation on internet use .
france already has some of the toughest web piracy laws in europe , and president nicolas sarkozy has repeatedly tried to present himself as a defender of france 's cultural heritage in the digital age , most recently calling for public projects to rival google 's plans for a massive online library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .

" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has presented himself as the defender of france 's heritage in the digital age proposals from prominent men guillaume cerutti , one of the authors of the report , told newspaper liberation that the levy , which would also apply to other operators such as msn and yahoo , would put an end to " enrichment without any limit or compensation . "
the paper also said the tax would apply even if the operator had its offices outside france , as long as the internet users who click on ad banners or sponsored links are in the country .
cerutti , president of sotheby 's in france , drew up the report together with former culture minister jacques toubon and patrick zelnik , a former music executive , whose work also includes producing the songs of france 's first lady , carla bruni-sarkozy .
extra investment in creative industries the three authors also suggest taxing internet service providers to raise tens of millions of euros that would be invested in developing the online music business and other creative sectors .
the report estimates that the tax could raise up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- this year .
zelnik added that the tax would take " a small percentage " of google 's online ad revenues , which he estimated at 800 million euros a year in total , according to liberation .
zelnik told the newspaper that taxing online ads " seemed inevitable if we want to preserve cultural pluralism and prevent ... the never-ending development of two or three world players . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has some of the toughest internet legislation in europe the french society of authors and composers sacd said it was " satisfied " with the proposals which would " encourage and stimulate the legal availability of works to the public . "
industry criticism but the proposals have faced criticism from think-tanks and other commentators .
the digital media think tank renaissance numerique , whose members include business leaders , said the tax proposal penalised advertisers unfairly .
" let 's stop demonizing the internet and consider the benefits the web brings , " said its co-president christine balague in a statement .
" neither online advertisers nor internet service providers are robbing artists , " he added .
" quite the contrary : they are taking part in bringing consumers and artists together . "
the new report was handed in to the culture ministry in paris earlier this week .
it was not immediately clear if the government has a timetable for acting on it. bk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say that the problem is worse in smaller towns and that more help is needed . at least 10 homeless people have died in germany as freezing winter conditions take their toll on the vulnerable .
those who perished were mostly older men sleeping in the open , under bridges , in doorways , and the remains of demolished houses according to the federal association for aid for the homeless , bagw .
there are fears that more may have died but have not yet been discovered .
" unfortunately we have to assume that more homeless people have not survived the cold days , " said bagw chief executive thomas specht .
the high proportion of older victims is attributed by the association to general poor health from a lifetime of sleeping rough .
according to the bagw , most of the victims were found in small and medium sized towns , while in larger cities the situation had been eased by the provision of emergency winter programs .
call for good quality shelters the group is calling for a national network of high quality , warm shelters to be set up for homeless people throughout germany .
it wants shelters to offer individual rooms , high standards of hygiene and flexible opening times .
there were 227,000 people officially classed as homeless in germany in 2008 , the group said , a reduction of six per cent on the previous year .
around 20,000 of those were living with no form of accommodation at all , a fall of just 1,000 compared with 2007 .
figures reveal a lower proportion of homeless people in eastern germany , a fact attributed to a greater number of vacant properties in that part of the country. rc / epd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has stressed the need for reforms in the country . on his first trip to the turkish capital , foreign minister westerwelle told an audience of turkish diplomats that he believed that turkey was not yet ready for eu membership .
" we all know that freedom of opinion , of the press and of religion are pillars of the values of our european community , " the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said , before adding that the " work of reform in turkey on its path to europe is not yet complete .
i want to encourage you to continue . "
but he promised that germany would honor its agreements on turkey 's entry .

"
on being asked whether he spoke for the whole government , westerwelle said , " i 'm not here as a tourist in shorts , but as the german foreign minister .
what i say , counts . "
westerwelle 's opposite number ahmut davutoglu responded positively to the german foreign minister 's speech , and said that turkey would do whatever it takes to gain entry to the eu .
" we want to fulfil all reforms .
everything that this process requires , we will do - especially in relation to germany . "

csu general secretary alexander dobrindt said , " i can only advise him not to come to secret agreements in turkey , as he did in poland , that we then have to clear up for weeks afterwards in the coalition . "
but in an exchange that further exacerbated tensions within the coalition government , the fdp 's minister of state werner hoyer rejected dobrindt 's statement and accused the csu of undermining the coalition contract and trying to draw attention to itself. bk / dpa / apd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has stressed the need for reforms in the country . on his first trip to the turkish capital , foreign minister westerwelle told an audience of turkish diplomats that he believed that turkey was not yet ready for eu membership .
" we all know that freedom of opinion , of the press and of religion are pillars of the values of our european community , " the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said , before adding that the " work of reform in turkey on its path to europe is not yet complete .
i want to encourage you to continue . "
but he promised that germany would honor its agreements on turkey 's entry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been negotiating for eu membership since 2005 not a tourist in shorts westerwelle pointed to the government 's coalition contract , which promised to engage in eu membership negotiations with an attitude that was " open to any result . "
on being asked whether he spoke for the whole government , westerwelle said , " i 'm not here as a tourist in shorts , but as the german foreign minister .
what i say , counts . "
westerwelle 's opposite number ahmut davutoglu responded positively to the german foreign minister 's speech , and said that turkey would do whatever it takes to gain entry to the eu .
" we want to fulfil all reforms .
everything that this process requires , we will do - especially in relation to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 2.7 million people with turkish roots live in germany strife at home however , westerwelle 's words prompted a sharp response from coalition allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , several of whose members favor offering turkey " a privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership .
csu general secretary alexander dobrindt said , " i can only advise him not to come to secret agreements in turkey , as he did in poland , that we then have to clear up for weeks afterwards in the coalition . "
but in an exchange that further exacerbated tensions within the coalition government , the fdp 's minister of state werner hoyer rejected dobrindt 's statement and accused the csu of undermining the coalition contract and trying to draw attention to itself. bk / dpa / apd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the error could cost upwards of 240 million euros if they are forced to issue replacements . german banks have been inundated with customer complaints after a software glitch rendered millions of checking and credit cards unusable in a variety of cash terminals in the new year , a bank spokesman said on wednesday . the banks are hoping software experts will be able to develop a program capable of instantly re-programming the faulty cards ' microchips when they are inserted in an automated teller machine -lrb- atm -rrb- . if that does n't work , banks may be forced to spend as much as 240 million euros to replace all 30 million cards containing a new anti-fraud microchip that does not recognize the year 2010 . the zka national credit panel said banks will make a final decision on what action to take within the next few days .
it 's a problem that nobody saw coming , according to thomas schlueter from the association of german banks . " it could be that these cards were already on the market for years so they were working fine from 2008 to 2009 for instance .
but they had a problem with the figure 2010 , and i think that was a problem that nobody was really aware of , " schlueter told deutsche welle . problem not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many faulty-card holders were forced to pay for items in cash only banks using the french card supplier gemalto were affected by the software glitch , and of the 30 million cards issued , only a fraction actually encountered problems . gemalto said it was working with its german clients to develop " a corrective process that avoids the replacement of the affected cards . " according to zka , only one batch of the microchips was causing problems .

slovakia 's border police chief has taken responsibilty for the gaff . slovak police responsible for a botched security test that sent explosives to ireland in the luggage of an unsuspecting danube wings passenger have apologized for the fiasco . the chief of the slovak border police , tibor mako , stepped down on thursday after apologizing for a blunder in security training that resulted in 90 grams -lrb- 3.17 ounces -rrb- of explosives being transported in a passenger 's baggage to dublin . the training exercise , which took place on saturday , was intended to test the ability of bomb-sniffing dogs to find explosives at poprad airport in northeastern slovakia . slovak border police inserted test packages containing small amounts of explosives into selected passengers ' luggage without their knowledge .
forgetful officer chief mako said the package was successfully detected , but a police officer " forgot to remove the explosives after a dog found them during a security test . " " the explosives were attached by accident to the backpack .
we are sorry that a good effort to test the security of civilian air transport turned out so badly , " mako told reporters . mako said the police officer failed to inform his superiors and only told poprad airport , which in turn sent dublin airport a telex message .
unwitting traveller interrogated however , dublin airport authority said in a statement that it had " no contact whatsoever " from the slovak side until tuesday . the 49-year-old slovak backpack owner - who has worked in ireland for three years and was returning from a christmas holiday in slovakia - was arrested under anti-terrorist laws tuesday and interrogated .
he was released without charge later that day . the blunder took place a week and a half after a nigerian man allegedly attempting to detonate explosives aboard a jetliner headed for detroit , michigan .
airport security staff in nigeria and the netherlands apparently failed to detect the man was carrying explosives . gmb / rc / smh / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech authorities have reached a consensus - and the answer is probably more than you think ! move over , amsterdam !
the czech republic has usurped the netherlands as the european country with the most lenient drug laws .
on december 14 , czech prime minister jan fischer 's government approved new standardized limits to clarify the acceptable levels for personal drug use .
under the new law , which took effect january 1 , a person may possess up to four tablets of ecstasy , 15 grams of marijuana , 1.5 grams of heroin , or one gram of cocaine , without facing criminal charges .
czech authorities have been quick to point out that the recently introduced limits do not constitute a change in the law , but rather serve as a clearer definition for law enforcement officials .
police previously relied on the ambiguous term " a small amount " as the dividing line between misdemeanor and felony prosecution .
under the new law , a person possessing less than the specified amount may still be charged with a misdemeanor - meaning he can be fined , but not jailed , for the offense .
the new levels are by far the most liberal in europe .
the quantities of heroin and marijuana permitted represent nearly three times the amounts allowed under dutch law , while in neighboring hungary , drug possession in any amount is potentially punishable by prison sentence. smh / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .

" germany 's export industries are on the road to improvement , but the recovery process will take longer , " bdi president hans-peter keitel wrote in his introduction to the report .
" the export industries had to battle through a tough setback in 2009 . "
in the first 10 months of 2009 , germany 's exports fell 27.4 % , compared with 20.4 percent for china and 21.4 percent for the us .

paris says that in order to be fair to new french citizens , it must be firm with those who do not follow the rules . france expelled more than 29,000 illegal immigrants last year , exceeding government targets . the figure , announced by immigration minister eric besson , is 2,000 more than a target set by french president nicolas sarkozy .
about 175,000 illegal immigrants had initially arrived in france on long-term visas during 2009 , according to government figures .
in the same period , besson told france 's europe 1 radio station , 108,000 foreigners were given french nationality .
policy " must be firm " besson reiterated that french policy on immigration was " firm and fair . "
he said that foreigners who settled legally were welcome and given help to integrate by learning the language as well as finding employment and accommodation . " therefore , " said besson , " we must deport those who enter illegally . "
among the deportations were the controversial repatriations of 12 afghans , who were sent back to their home country on planes chartered with britain .
besson , who was criticized for the deportations to afghanistan , pointed out that britain deported 1,000 afghans during 2009. rc / afp / reuters / kna editor .

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .
in 2007 , china surpassed germany to become the world 's third largest economy behind the us and japan , and in 2010 , it is expected to climb to the number two spot .
slow recovery germany 's dethronement from top exporter status comes as analysts predict a slow economic recovery for the country .
the bdi federation of german industries said in its latest foreign trade report that its export sector would n't return to pre-crisis levels until 2014 .
" germany 's export industries are on the road to improvement , but the recovery process will take longer , " bdi president hans-peter keitel wrote in his introduction to the report .
" the export industries had to battle through a tough setback in 2009 . "
in the first 10 months of 2009 , germany 's exports fell 27.4 percent , compared with 20.4 percent for china and 21.4 percent for the us .
china has recently come under harsh criticism from both europe and the us for allegedly failing to comply with global trade rules. vj / dpa / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .
and , huber says , the change to using real women instead of models is a permanent one .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .

following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .

ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .

" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine , brigitte , has started the new year with a new concept : replacing professional models with real women .
it 's a response , they say , to what the modern woman wants . brigitte is the fashion and lifestyle bible for the german everywoman .
women flicking through the january issue will see just what they were expecting : diet tips , man-advice and models advertising clothing brands and accessories .
but a closer look reveals a subtle change .
the women wearing the clothes are not professional models , but everyday women .
there is franca cuneo , a restaurant owner from hamburg , didda jonsdottir , a 44-year-old singer from rekjavik , saleswoman chiara cappellini and so on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stylists and photographers lend the ' real ' models a touch of glamour " there 's been a change over the last couple of years where fashion is concerned and what women want from their role models , " brigitte 's joint editor-in-chief , brigitte huber , told deutsche welle .
following in dove 's footsteps " on the one hand there has been a change in the way trends work .
it is n't the big designers defining the scene any more , it 's people off the street , actresses , politicians .
and women have changed .
they do n't need unnamed models defining how they are supposed to be living , " huber said .
brigitte is not the first to come up with the concept .
in 2004 , dove beauty products launched their own hugely successful " campaign for real beauty , " and they 've been using laypeople as models ever since .
but magazines have been slow to follow suit .
despite the ongoing debate over media images of superthin models and their effects on society , glamour - and svelte beauty - sells .
modern society is still in the thrall of the very thin .
even this first edition of the much-touted new brigitte has a great new diet as its cover story .
ties between eating disorders , media thomas huber - no relation to the magazine 's editor - is a specialist in eating disorders and a nutritional therapist . " media is often blamed for eating disorders , " huber told dw , " what we often forget is that they are not creating an ideal , they are transporting it .
selling it so to speak . "
but there should not be a total eclipse of responsibility he says .
while there is little factual evidence linking media imagery to eating disorders , he says , one study carried out in fiji shows the closest-known correlation .
researchers asked women about their concepts of beauty and self-perceptions in a period before there was widespread access to television and advertising , and in a period after .
" afterwards there was a dramatic increase in the number of eating disorders .
where previously women had said thin women looked ill , they now identified with thin as being beautiful . "
huber said .
a step too near ?
there are also certain professions that put people at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , huber said . among them are ballet dancers and models .
still , there have been criticisms , including from within brigitte 's readership , that the magazine has not gone far enough .
far from being revolutionary , some say , the women used in the first issue are too close to the models used in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the difference between the old and the new is too slight brigitte huber defended the choice of models , however : " there was never any plan to make brigitte a magazine for larger women , " she said .
nor does the strategy of changing size zero-models for normal folk aim to declare war on the fashion industry .
" it is about women who are tired of looking at images that have nothing to do with them .
they want to see a beauty that is transported because of a person 's charisma , " said huber .
the magazine , which sells some 700,000 copies month and enjoys a readership of 3 million an issue , has also stressed that its choice of real women will not mean an amateur approach to the photo shoots .
and huber scoffs at the suggestion this might have been a marketing ploy to boost falling sales .
" such a major change is not taken on the spur of the moment for very short term results .
it came after a lot of research into what our readers wanted and our own questions about the modeling industry . "
women from all countries , all ages and a lot of sizes are eligible to apply .

meanwhile , a new report warns that germany 's export sector will not recover from the crisis until 2014 . china has overtaken germany as the world 's number one exporter , according to the latest trade data from 2009 .
in the first ten months of 2009 , china exported a total of 663 billion euros of goods while germany exported 638 billions worth , according to customs data from the global trade information services , a geneva-based market research firm .
the announcement comes as little surprise to analysts who say china has weathered the global financial crisis better than other major economies .
the past decade has seen china report high annual growth in its export sector - regularly topping 20 percent .
in 2007 , china surpassed germany to become the world 's third largest economy behind the us and japan , and in 2010 , it is expected to climb to the number two spot .
slow recovery germany 's dethronement from top exporter status comes as analysts predict a slow economic recovery for the country .
the bdi federation of german industries said in its latest foreign trade report that its export sector would n't return to pre-crisis levels until 2014 .
" germany 's export industries are on the road to improvement , but the recovery process will take longer , " bdi president hans-peter keitel wrote in his introduction to the report .
" the export industries had to battle through a tough setback in 2009 . "
in the first 10 months of 2009 , germany 's exports fell 27.4 percent , compared with 20.4 percent for china and 21.4 percent for the us .
china has recently come under harsh criticism from both europe and the us for allegedly failing to comply with global trade rules. vj / dpa / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the error could cost upwards of 240 million euros if they are forced to issue replacements . german banks have been inundated with customer complaints after a software glitch rendered millions of checking and credit cards unusable in a variety of cash terminals in the new year , a bank spokesman said on wednesday . the banks are hoping software experts will be able to develop a program capable of instantly re-programming the faulty cards ' microchips when they are inserted in an automated teller machine -lrb- atm -rrb- . if that does n't work , banks may be forced to spend as much as 240 million euros to replace all 30 million cards containing a new anti-fraud microchip that does not recognize the year 2010 . the zka national credit panel said banks will make a final decision on what action to take within the next few days .
it 's a problem that nobody saw coming , according to thomas schlueter from the association of german banks . " it could be that these cards were already on the market for years so they were working fine from 2008 to 2009 for instance .
but they had a problem with the figure 2010 , and i think that was a problem that nobody was really aware of , " schlueter told deutsche welle . problem not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many faulty-card holders were forced to pay for items in cash only banks using the french card supplier gemalto were affected by the software glitch , and of the 30 million cards issued , only a fraction actually encountered problems . gemalto said it was working with its german clients to develop " a corrective process that avoids the replacement of the affected cards . " according to zka , only one batch of the microchips was causing problems .
the new anti-fraud technology in the chips was created by emvco . meanwhile , banks have been blamed for not providing their clients with enough information . " the banks ' handling of this has been disastrous , " banking expert manfred westphal told german radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" i need to know as a bank customer , first : does this problem affect my own card , and if so , exactly which functions are affected ? " " the banks do not tell you .
and so many germans will now go on their winter holiday to switzerland , for example , and find that they can not obtain any money with their atm cards , " westphal said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks affected by the software glitch plan to come up with a solution by next week retailers concerned there has also been some concern about how the system failure will affect the broader economy , as many people are unable to withdraw cash or pay at the till .
some have even had their cards ' eaten ' by the automated teller machine after the faulty software determined they had expired . now the german retail industry is calling on banks to compensate traders for lost earnings . " we have angered customers and lost revenues through no fault of our own , " stefan genth , head of the association of german retailers , said on wednesday . in total , about 20 percent of one-million retail point-of-sale terminals were affected by the glitch that officials say is similar to the " y2k bug " that triggered concerns at the turn of the century . exact figures as to just how much damage this latest fault has inflicted on shopkeepers are not yet available . however , schlueter believes any harm to retailers was miniscule .
" most of the systems that are running in the retail sector are still using the magnetic stripe -lrb- as opposed to the microchip -rrb- .
so we have still got these on the cards as a fall back system , " he said . the banks worst hit by the glitch were germany 's dominant public-sector savings banks and cooperative banks , but client of private lenders such as postbank and commerzbank also reported problems . author : vanessa johnston editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .

the oecd said the nations had made sufficient commitments to implement oecd standards of " transparency and the exchange of information . "
still , joachim poss , deputy leader of the social democrats - germany 's largest opposition party - told the daily tageszeitung that the finance ministry 's findings were inappropriate .
" this is comparable to simply scrapping the law passed in september .
the new finance ministry , the new government , is simply fulfilling the wishes of the economy , which massively financed its political campaign , " he said .
green party economic expert gerhard schick said finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was " effectively ending the fight against tax evasion in germany . "
schaeuble , meanwhile , in an interview with the german branch of the ap news agency , called on the oecd to enforce the standards of transparency with which suspected tax havens have agreed to comply .

tax havens , according to the finance ministry , no longer exist . the german government says it has no grounds to pursue sanctions against germans who carry out bank transactions with states it had previously accused of being tax havens .
last year , the finance ministry , then run by social democrat peer steinbrueck , shepherded legislation through parliament that allows the government to take measures against german residents transferring money to countries notorious for low taxation .
under the law , german companies or individuals interacting with such countries would be forced to document the transactions for german tax offices .
lack of compliance would result in germany revoking companies ' privileges and imposing fines on individuals .
a statement from the finance ministry , however , now run by christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , said that " no state or area fulfilled the criteria for prohibitive measures suggested in the september tax evasion law .
at this point , we see no reason to force taxpayers or banks to provide documentation of accounts . "
michael offer , spokesman for the finance ministry , called the findings a " positive sign . "
" it 's clear that those states that had previously been suspected of enabling tax evasion have reacted to international pressure to fulfill the standards outlined in the new law , " he said .

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

some players have better chances than others of making the cut .
deutsche welle looks at the likely squad members . somewhere in joachim loew 's office , probably under lock and key , is a scrawled list of names .
right now , it 's just a guide .
but as the summer of 2010 gets closer , loew will soon have to make 23 choices .
this final list will be germany 's squad for the world cup in south africa .
loew still has a few months to put the players through their paces before deciding who will be printed out on pristine dfb-headed paper and sent off to fifa headquarters .
the likely candidates are the stalwart members of the germany squads that made it to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup and the final of euro 2008 .
safe bets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will almost certainly get an invite if injury does n't claim him before june , germany captain michael ballack can safely start planning for his third world cup .
the chelsea midfielder is prospering under new coach carlo ancelotti , and while he will be nearing his 34th birthday by the time germany fly to south africa , ballack 's experience and leadership will prove invaluable if jogi loew does what many expect and peppers his squad with young stars .
the captain may not be the driving force he once was , but his more settled and intelligent approach of recent seasons will aid those flyers around him .
some might consider bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski to be contemporaries of ballack , as both have clocked up a wealth of international experience since breaking into the senior team .
but the two are still only 25 and 24 respectively -lrb- podolski will turn 25 during the world cup -rrb- .
the 2006 tournament on home soil saw the dynamic duo explode onto the world cup scene .
when germany labored to the final of euro 2008 , schweini and poldi were among the most consistent and lively .
podolski 's trials at his beloved cologne this season are unlikely to prevent him from being picked for south africa as he remains one of germany 's most dangerous attacking threats .
schweinsteiger will almost certainly fly to the world cup as one of germany 's most creative midfielders .
experience and reliability a must for defensive picks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm can start thinking about south africa germany 's defensive options , as well-tuned as a mercedes , will undoubtedly feature the ever-consistent and reliable philipp lahm , the rangy and combative per mertesacker and the composed and intelligent arne friedrich .
lahm is still considered to be one of the world 's best wingbacks and rarely has a bad game for either club or country .
mertesacker is the type of defender forwards hate to play against : all legs and elbows , with a towering aerial presence .
friedrich , despite captaining basement club hertha berlin , is still a class act , and his experience alone will earn him a ticket .
behind these shoe-ins lies one of three dominant german keepers .
after the loss of robert enke , the number 1 jersey is up for grabs .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese are the men battling for the role between the posts .
all three will fly to south africa , but adler may just be ahead of the other two in terms of who starts the first game .
young bremen playmaker set for first world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mesut oezil , right , will add a spark of creativity to midfield in the midfield , loew will surely hand werder bremen 's mesut oezil his first world cup finals berth .
while michael ballack may be the fire in germany 's belly , oezil will be the spark .
in a team lacking star power and low on inventiveness , the bremen playmaker is likely to be given the chance to shine on the world stage .
a magnificent season to date will be enough to complete simon rolfes ' full international rehabilitation as the bayer leverkusen midfielder wins a call-up to his first world cup squad after a period of exclusion .
thomas hitzlsperger is the most likely to be handed the strongman role .
the stuttgart midfielder may edge out stalwart torsten frings , despite his desperate form so far this season .
another player who is likely to get the nod despite a stuttering season is miroslav klose .
the bayern munich striker has been off-color of late , but any coach who would leave a world cup golden boot winner behind would do so at his peril .
klose knows world cups and how to score at them .
having a striker of his pedigree in the squad will be a must .
he is likely to be joined in attack by bayern team mate mario gomez .
after experiencing a long barren spell as germany 's main striker when he first came into the squad in 2007 , the non-striking striker has since found his scoring boots .
he seems to have more confidence at bayern these days , and this has been reflected in his recent international performances .
solid squad members sweat over world cup places bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng may profit from loew 's emphasis on youth the rest of the squad will be made up of floating players , some more buoyant than others .
loew has put an emphasis on youth , which means hamburg defender jerome boateng will likely be rewarded for a strong start to his hsv career with a world cup ticket .
hoffenheim 's andreas beck , vfl wolfsburg 's marcel schaefer , serdar tasci from vfb stuttgart and schalke 's heiko westermann could also join him on the plane .
hamburg 's piotr trochowski would be a good bet to join the ranks of midfielders heading to south africa after a good season in the north and some strong performances in the world cup qualifiers .
he could be joined by christian gentner from vfl wolfsburg , stuttgart 's sami khedira and werder bremen 's marko marin .
outside bets for a midfield spot could include bayern 's young attacking midfielder thomas mueller and leverkusen 's toni kroos .
striking options to lead to surprise inclusion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could kevin kuranyi return to the white shirt of germany ?
if he continues the rich vein of form he has tapped with bayer leverkusen , stefan kiessling would be a handy attacker to have in south africa .
this has been his finest season to date , and if he carries on knocking them in , kiessling could add to the three caps he has for the senior germany team at the world cup .
he could even break his international duck there .
stuttgart 's brazilian-born striker cacau could also be a back-up striker after being brought into the germany fold in 2009 .
his four mainly cameo roles could be expanded upon this summer .
one huge surprise could come in the return of banished forward kevin kuranyi .
the schalke striker walked out on germany in 2008 and has not played for the national team since , with loew stating that he would never pick the sulky star again .
this season , however , kuranyi 's form may change jogi 's mind .
a player who has hit 30 or more goals a season for the past four years , kuranyi has 16 to his name already .
could reconciliation be in the cards should germany 's striking options become reduced ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.01.2010 german intelligence agency struggles to adapt to new enemies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence work has changed over the past two decades intelligence services have recently come under scrutiny for security lapses .
german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .
too much red tape ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life and death matters can quickly turn into a lot of clerical work at a recent conference attended by global security experts at the hans-seidel foundation in munich , gujer defended the bnd .
he said that , due to germany 's nazi past , the bnd underwent close and constant scrutiny .
gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .
" that problem is compounded by the relatively low financial and human resources available to intelligence agencies , " gujer said .
" all this means they are constantly racing from one catastrophe to the next . "
unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-georg wieck once had one of the toughest jobs in germany wieck suggests that improved communication on all levels is the key to better intelligence services .
this means communicating internally between various security services and their offshoots .
it also means sharing information at the intermediate level with undersecretaries of state and in discussions with the top politicians . however , wieck also says that intelligence chiefs must be as experienced as possible , so that politicians never dismiss their advice . " there is always that danger , " he says .
" but if someone has international experience himself , his words will be taken seriously .
whether any action is taken as a result , however , is an entirely different matter . " " when it came to my area of expertise , i always had the access that i needed , and people would listen - even if the relationship was n't always brilliant . " the security landscape has changed beyond recognition in recent years ; however , that can not be an excuse for shortcomings in international intelligence , wieck says . if someone is planning an attack , he says , there will be evidence that intelligence services can recognize , provided they know where to look . author : peter philipp -lrb- mh -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gujer also singled out germany 's tendency toward bureaucracy as a problem , saying that understaffed departments can often get lost in a sea of paperwork , rather than focussing their energies on quality analysis of information .

unheeded advice ?
even when an intelligence agency has gathered genuinely interesting and important information , it is rarely their job to act upon their findings .
the interaction - or lack thereof - between politicians and their intelligence chiefs can hamper even the finest attempts to protect their country .
" the world of politics is n't adverse to advice , " says former bnd chief hans-georg wieck .
" however , one must address the politicians in a way that makes them more likely to act on your information .
" most politicians do have their own view of the world order , but they are still interested in what we have to say , because they are keen to avoid mistakes and to promote positive developments . "

german security experts say mistakes are inevitable , but the fault does n't always lie where you 'd think . international intelligence agencies have changed almost beyond recognition over the past 20 years , primarily because of changing threats to national security .
as global terrorism becomes the primary concern of most western governments , intelligence services have had to look for new ways to deal with a new enemy .
" it 's not like the cold war days , when security services faced a very predictable opponent , " eric gujer , security expert and journalist at switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung newspaper told deutsche welle .
" nowadays , intelligence agencies are dealing with an ever-changing landscape .
and in that situation it 's impossible to react as effectively as during the cold war . back then , you could gradually adapt to face your foe .
those days are over . "
gujer should know .
former german chancellor helmut schmidt once joked that reports published in the zurich paper were usually more valuable to him during his tenure at germany 's helm -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- than were the briefings he received from the german intelligence agency bnd .

czech authorities have reached a consensus - and the answer is probably more than you think ! move over , amsterdam !
the czech republic has usurped the netherlands as the european country with the most lenient drug laws .
on december 14 , czech prime minister jan fischer 's government approved new standardized limits to clarify the acceptable levels for personal drug use .
under the new law , which took effect january 1 , a person may possess up to four tablets of ecstasy , 15 grams of marijuana , 1.5 grams of heroin , or one gram of cocaine , without facing criminal charges .
czech authorities have been quick to point out that the recently introduced limits do not constitute a change in the law , but rather serve as a clearer definition for law enforcement officials .
police previously relied on the ambiguous term " a small amount " as the dividing line between misdemeanor and felony prosecution .
under the new law , a person possessing less than the specified amount may still be charged with a misdemeanor - meaning he can be fined , but not jailed , for the offense .
the new levels are by far the most liberal in europe .
the quantities of heroin and marijuana permitted represent nearly three times the amounts allowed under dutch law , while in neighboring hungary , drug possession in any amount is potentially punishable by prison sentence. smh / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
