program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.01.2010 anti-pirate training for filipino seamen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate boats in the gulf of aden filipinos make up the largest group of seamen on the world ’ s oceans .
it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .

renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .

these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.01.2010 another chance for nepal 's peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent clashes between maoist protesters and the police last year the un security council has extended the mandate of the un mission in nepal , unmin , until may 15 .
this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .
the manifest distrust between them and new delhi does not bode well for the future of the peace process in kathmandu .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.01.2010 another chance for nepal 's peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent clashes between maoist protesters and the police last year the un security council has extended the mandate of the un mission in nepal , unmin , until may 15 .
this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .
the manifest distrust between them and new delhi does not bode well for the future of the peace process in kathmandu .

this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .
the manifest distrust between them and new delhi does not bode well for the future of the peace process in kathmandu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.01.2010 anti-pirate training for filipino seamen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate boats in the gulf of aden filipinos make up the largest group of seamen on the world ’ s oceans .
it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.01.2010 another chance for nepal 's peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent clashes between maoist protesters and the police last year the un security council has extended the mandate of the un mission in nepal , unmin , until may 15 .
this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.01.2010 another chance for nepal 's peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent clashes between maoist protesters and the police last year the un security council has extended the mandate of the un mission in nepal , unmin , until may 15 .
this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .
the manifest distrust between them and new delhi does not bode well for the future of the peace process in kathmandu .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .
the manifest distrust between them and new delhi does not bode well for the future of the peace process in kathmandu .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .

social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .

the nationalized company wants to spin off its liabilities and work towards a return to private ownership . crisis-hit property lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- will put a multi-billion euro package of holdings into the country 's largest " bad bank . "
the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after .

the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.01.2010 france fetes jazz legend django reinhardt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury led to reinhardt 's unique style born one hundred years ago , manouche jazz legend django reinhardt is often considered the best jazz guitarist of all time .
france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .
originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .
countless other musicians have named reinhardt as having a major impact on their work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : django in new york in 1946 and even now , one hundred years after his birth , and over fifty years after his death at age 43 , django 's sound lives on .
some of france 's best loved jazz artists are manouche guitarists like christian escoude and bireli lagrene .
" gypsy jazz " plays all the time on french radio , and manouche jazz venues are cropping up all around paris .
the oldest is chope aux puces , run by marcel campion , who has also opened a manouche guitar school above the club . " what characterizes this music is a rhythmical style of accompaniment we call ' the pump , " ' campion noted .
" it 's rare for musicians to master it .
it 's a manouche jazz thing .
but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play . " perhaps it 's the ability to reveal the musical sensibilities in people that is another of reinhardt 's legacies , after all , his nickname " django " is romani for " i awake .

but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play . " perhaps it 's the ability to reveal the musical sensibilities in people that is another of reinhardt 's legacies , after all , his nickname " django " is romani for " i awake .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.01.2010 france fetes jazz legend django reinhardt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury led to reinhardt 's unique style born one hundred years ago , manouche jazz legend django reinhardt is often considered the best jazz guitarist of all time .
france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .
originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .
countless other musicians have named reinhardt as having a major impact on their work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : django in new york in 1946 and even now , one hundred years after his birth , and over fifty years after his death at age 43 , django 's sound lives on .
some of france 's best loved jazz artists are manouche guitarists like christian escoude and bireli lagrene .
" gypsy jazz " plays all the time on french radio , and manouche jazz venues are cropping up all around paris .
the oldest is chope aux puces , run by marcel campion , who has also opened a manouche guitar school above the club . " what characterizes this music is a rhythmical style of accompaniment we call ' the pump , " ' campion noted .
" it 's rare for musicians to master it .
it 's a manouche jazz thing .
but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play . " perhaps it 's the ability to reveal the musical sensibilities in people that is another of reinhardt 's legacies , after all , his nickname " django " is romani for " i awake .

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .

megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .

it is no longer about consumerism alone .

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .

she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .
if they can be tempted to buy into the label 's new toned-down elegance , escada may just be granted a new lease on life . author : mariana schroeder -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .

mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .

"
the nationalized company wants to spin off its liabilities and work towards a return to private ownership . crisis-hit property lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- will put a multi-billion euro package of holdings into the country 's largest " bad bank . "
the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
hre was germany 's highest profile casualty of the financial crisis , nearly collapsing in 2008 .
it needed more than 100 billion euros in guarantees to save it , which came mainly from the german government .
the european commission will have to decide whether hre 's plan complies with european union rules on state aid. rc / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the nationalized company wants to spin off its liabilities and work towards a return to private ownership . crisis-hit property lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- will put a multi-billion euro package of holdings into the country 's largest " bad bank . "
the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
hre was germany 's highest profile casualty of the financial crisis , nearly collapsing in 2008 .
it needed more than 100 billion euros in guarantees to save it , which came mainly from the german government .
the european commission will have to decide whether hre 's plan complies with european union rules on state aid. rc / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own . " we never saw large areas so totally destroyed like in the area of port-au-prince , " he said , citing the 2004 indian ocean tsunami as the only comparable disaster . author : alina dain editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.01.2010 france fetes jazz legend django reinhardt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury led to reinhardt 's unique style born one hundred years ago , manouche jazz legend django reinhardt is often considered the best jazz guitarist of all time .
france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .
originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .
countless other musicians have named reinhardt as having a major impact on their work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : django in new york in 1946 and even now , one hundred years after his birth , and over fifty years after his death at age 43 , django 's sound lives on .
some of france 's best loved jazz artists are manouche guitarists like christian escoude and bireli lagrene .
" gypsy jazz " plays all the time on french radio , and manouche jazz venues are cropping up all around paris .
the oldest is chope aux puces , run by marcel campion , who has also opened a manouche guitar school above the club . " what characterizes this music is a rhythmical style of accompaniment we call ' the pump , " ' campion noted .
" it 's rare for musicians to master it .
it 's a manouche jazz thing .
but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

dw-world.de bankers surprised by extent of hre crisis private bankers in germany were surprised by the serious difficulties plaguing hypo real estate , an expert in the sector told a committee investigating the bank 's failure and subsequent bailout .
-lrb- 18.08.2009 -rrb- shareholders give green light for nationalization of hre hypo real estate shareholders have cleared the way for the beleaguered mortgage lender to pass into government hands at a special meeting .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

dw-world.de bankers surprised by extent of hre crisis private bankers in germany were surprised by the serious difficulties plaguing hypo real estate , an expert in the sector told a committee investigating the bank 's failure and subsequent bailout .
-lrb- 18.08.2009 -rrb- shareholders give green light for nationalization of hre hypo real estate shareholders have cleared the way for the beleaguered mortgage lender to pass into government hands at a special meeting .
but critics still say nationalizing a bank contravenes germany 's constitution .

this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "

this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .

the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .

this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .
the manifest distrust between them and new delhi does not bode well for the future of the peace process in kathmandu .

this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 22.01.2010 fashion label escada back on the catwalk after business facelift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escada is back from the brink after struggling with declining sales for years , escada - one of the world ’ s best-known global fashion labels - is back .
the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .
if they can be tempted to buy into the label 's new toned-down elegance , escada may just be granted a new lease on life . author : mariana schroeder -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg says a troop increase is possible . angela merkel will sit down with foreign minister guido westerwelle , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , interior minister thomas de maiziere and development minister dirk niebel on monday to determine their future contributions in light of a worsening security situation and increasing pressure to withdraw from afghanistan entirely .
on tuesday and wednesday , they 'll be joined by afghan president hamid karzai as he stops off in berlin on his way to the international conference in london .
after a joint press conference with karzai on wednesday afternoon , merkel is expected to set out her government 's position .
the discussions come amid calls by the opposition social democrats to withdraw german troops by no later than 2015 .
party chief sigmar gabriel said on friday that " if we step up fighting , it means more civilian deaths . "
germany may increase troops news agency reuters , quoting an anonymous defense official in berlin , reported friday that the government may seek permission from parliament to send 1,500 more troops to afghanistan as part of president obama 's troop surge .
there are some 4,500 german troops already in the country .
however , the german defense ministry told reuters that there was no factual basis for such reports .
but minister guttenberg has hinted that a troop increase is possible .
" it ca n't be ruled out that we 'll stay at this limit or that we 'll go beyond it , " guttenberg said friday .
" we 're not just talking about troops , we 're also talking about training -lrb- afghan -rrb- police and bolstering civilian aid ...
this is n't a debate about combat troops , it 's about whether we need greater protection there .
that 's all being worked out just now , and this will be the basis for a figure we 'll present next week . "

britain wants a timetable for transferring control of provinces and districts to the afghan authorities .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own . " we never saw large areas so totally destroyed like in the area of port-au-prince , " he said , citing the 2004 indian ocean tsunami as the only comparable disaster . author : alina dain editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de even before deadly quake , haiti 's situation was dire at its founding haiti was a beacon of freedom , now it is the poorhouse of the western hemisphere .

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.01.2010 france fetes jazz legend django reinhardt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury led to reinhardt 's unique style born one hundred years ago , manouche jazz legend django reinhardt is often considered the best jazz guitarist of all time .
france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .
originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .
countless other musicians have named reinhardt as having a major impact on their work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : django in new york in 1946 and even now , one hundred years after his birth , and over fifty years after his death at age 43 , django 's sound lives on .
some of france 's best loved jazz artists are manouche guitarists like christian escoude and bireli lagrene .
" gypsy jazz " plays all the time on french radio , and manouche jazz venues are cropping up all around paris .
the oldest is chope aux puces , run by marcel campion , who has also opened a manouche guitar school above the club . " what characterizes this music is a rhythmical style of accompaniment we call ' the pump , " ' campion noted .
" it 's rare for musicians to master it .
it 's a manouche jazz thing .
but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play . " perhaps it 's the ability to reveal the musical sensibilities in people that is another of reinhardt 's legacies , after all , his nickname " django " is romani for " i awake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 22.01.2010 fashion label escada back on the catwalk after business facelift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escada is back from the brink after struggling with declining sales for years , escada - one of the world ’ s best-known global fashion labels - is back .
the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .
if they can be tempted to buy into the label 's new toned-down elegance , escada may just be granted a new lease on life . author : mariana schroeder -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

the nationalized company wants to spin off its liabilities and work towards a return to private ownership . crisis-hit property lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- will put a multi-billion euro package of holdings into the country 's largest " bad bank . "
the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
hre was germany 's highest profile casualty of the financial crisis , nearly collapsing in 2008 .
it needed more than 100 billion euros in guarantees to save it , which came mainly from the german government .

"
the nationalized company wants to spin off its liabilities and work towards a return to private ownership . crisis-hit property lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- will put a multi-billion euro package of holdings into the country 's largest " bad bank . "
the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
hre was germany 's highest profile casualty of the financial crisis , nearly collapsing in 2008 .
it needed more than 100 billion euros in guarantees to save it , which came mainly from the german government .
the european commission will have to decide whether hre 's plan complies with european union rules on state aid. rc / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 22.01.2010 haiti aid workers rely on satellite maps from german institute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the damage in port-au-prince was clearly evident at first glance for relief organizations in haiti , understanding the earthquake 's full damage is difficult .
workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .

originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.01.2010 france fetes jazz legend django reinhardt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury led to reinhardt 's unique style born one hundred years ago , manouche jazz legend django reinhardt is often considered the best jazz guitarist of all time .
france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .
originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .
countless other musicians have named reinhardt as having a major impact on their work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : django in new york in 1946 and even now , one hundred years after his birth , and over fifty years after his death at age 43 , django 's sound lives on .
some of france 's best loved jazz artists are manouche guitarists like christian escoude and bireli lagrene .
" gypsy jazz " plays all the time on french radio , and manouche jazz venues are cropping up all around paris .
the oldest is chope aux puces , run by marcel campion , who has also opened a manouche guitar school above the club . " what characterizes this music is a rhythmical style of accompaniment we call ' the pump , " ' campion noted .
" it 's rare for musicians to master it .
it 's a manouche jazz thing .
but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play . " perhaps it 's the ability to reveal the musical sensibilities in people that is another of reinhardt 's legacies , after all , his nickname " django " is romani for " i awake .

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .

mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .
if they can be tempted to buy into the label 's new toned-down elegance , escada may just be granted a new lease on life . author : mariana schroeder -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .

social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .

" we 're not just talking about troops , we 're also talking about training -lrb- afghan -rrb- police and bolstering civilian aid ...
this is n't a debate about combat troops , it 's about whether we need greater protection there .
that 's all being worked out just now , and this will be the basis for a figure we 'll present next week . "

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .
if they can be tempted to buy into the label 's new toned-down elegance , escada may just be granted a new lease on life . author : mariana schroeder -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 22.01.2010 fashion label escada back on the catwalk after business facelift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escada is back from the brink after struggling with declining sales for years , escada - one of the world ’ s best-known global fashion labels - is back .
the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .
if they can be tempted to buy into the label 's new toned-down elegance , escada may just be granted a new lease on life . author : mariana schroeder -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

the nationalized company wants to spin off its liabilities and work towards a return to private ownership . crisis-hit property lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- will put a multi-billion euro package of holdings into the country 's largest " bad bank . "
the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
hre was germany 's highest profile casualty of the financial crisis , nearly collapsing in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 22.01.2010 haiti aid workers rely on satellite maps from german institute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the damage in port-au-prince was clearly evident at first glance for relief organizations in haiti , understanding the earthquake 's full damage is difficult .
workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .

" relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .
originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .
countless other musicians have named reinhardt as having a major impact on their work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : django in new york in 1946 and even now , one hundred years after his birth , and over fifty years after his death at age 43 , django 's sound lives on .
some of france 's best loved jazz artists are manouche guitarists like christian escoude and bireli lagrene .
" gypsy jazz " plays all the time on french radio , and manouche jazz venues are cropping up all around paris .
the oldest is chope aux puces , run by marcel campion , who has also opened a manouche guitar school above the club . " what characterizes this music is a rhythmical style of accompaniment we call ' the pump , " ' campion noted .
" it 's rare for musicians to master it .
it 's a manouche jazz thing .
but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play . " perhaps it 's the ability to reveal the musical sensibilities in people that is another of reinhardt 's legacies , after all , his nickname " django " is romani for " i awake .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time .

there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg says a troop increase is possible . angela merkel will sit down with foreign minister guido westerwelle , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , interior minister thomas de maiziere and development minister dirk niebel on monday to determine their future contributions in light of a worsening security situation and increasing pressure to withdraw from afghanistan entirely .
on tuesday and wednesday , they 'll be joined by afghan president hamid karzai as he stops off in berlin on his way to the international conference in london .
after a joint press conference with karzai on wednesday afternoon , merkel is expected to set out her government 's position .
the discussions come amid calls by the opposition social democrats to withdraw german troops by no later than 2015 .
party chief sigmar gabriel said on friday that " if we step up fighting , it means more civilian deaths . "
germany may increase troops news agency reuters , quoting an anonymous defense official in berlin , reported friday that the government may seek permission from parliament to send 1,500 more troops to afghanistan as part of president obama 's troop surge .
there are some 4,500 german troops already in the country .
however , the german defense ministry told reuters that there was no factual basis for such reports .
but minister guttenberg has hinted that a troop increase is possible .
" it ca n't be ruled out that we 'll stay at this limit or that we 'll go beyond it , " guttenberg said friday .
" we 're not just talking about troops , we 're also talking about training -lrb- afghan -rrb- police and bolstering civilian aid ...
this is n't a debate about combat troops , it 's about whether we need greater protection there .
that 's all being worked out just now , and this will be the basis for a figure we 'll present next week . "

karzai is expected to present a strategy to offer taliban fighters stipends and education if they give up their arms .

in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

this is n't a debate about combat troops , it 's about whether we need greater protection there .
that 's all being worked out just now , and this will be the basis for a figure we 'll present next week . "

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .

according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .

"
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.01.2010 france fetes jazz legend django reinhardt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury led to reinhardt 's unique style born one hundred years ago , manouche jazz legend django reinhardt is often considered the best jazz guitarist of all time .
france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 22.01.2010 haiti aid workers rely on satellite maps from german institute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the damage in port-au-prince was clearly evident at first glance for relief organizations in haiti , understanding the earthquake 's full damage is difficult .
workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own . " we never saw large areas so totally destroyed like in the area of port-au-prince , " he said , citing the 2004 indian ocean tsunami as the only comparable disaster . author : alina dain editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .

hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 22.01.2010 fashion label escada back on the catwalk after business facelift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escada is back from the brink after struggling with declining sales for years , escada - one of the world ’ s best-known global fashion labels - is back .
the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 22.01.2010 fashion label escada back on the catwalk after business facelift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escada is back from the brink after struggling with declining sales for years , escada - one of the world ’ s best-known global fashion labels - is back .
the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .
" i said to a colleague before i came in that i did n't have to like it - i had to believe it .
and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .
they have some great pieces and are moving in the right direction , " drier said .
the organizers made every effort to show that the luxury label is back - champagne flowed , masses of black calla lilies filled huge urns , and the mood was upbeat .
but in the end , despite all the trapping , it is the customers who will decide escada 's fate .
if they can be tempted to buy into the label 's new toned-down elegance , escada may just be granted a new lease on life . author : mariana schroeder -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the nationalized company wants to spin off its liabilities and work towards a return to private ownership . crisis-hit property lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- will put a multi-billion euro package of holdings into the country 's largest " bad bank . "
the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
hre was germany 's highest profile casualty of the financial crisis , nearly collapsing in 2008 .
it needed more than 100 billion euros in guarantees to save it , which came mainly from the german government .
the european commission will have to decide whether hre 's plan complies with european union rules on state aid. rc / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

" relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own .

the move will help the nationalized group to rebuild after it was hit heavily by the financial crisis in september 2008 .
hre is to shift 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 296 billion -rrb- of assets into the bad bank , with the move set to take place in the second half of 2010 .
the news was announced on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period in which banks can apply to form bad banks where they can place " toxic " assets that have become liabilities .
the german government paved the way for creation of bad banks as a way to help companies to get rid of unwanted assets and protect their balance sheets .
advocates of the plan say it leaves a healthier core bank that can carry on business .
however , many banks and lenders have avoided taking part in the belief that the program presents more disadvantages than advantages .
many banks have said the rules of the bad bank program would add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
hre was germany 's highest profile casualty of the financial crisis , nearly collapsing in 2008 .
it needed more than 100 billion euros in guarantees to save it , which came mainly from the german government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.01.2010 france fetes jazz legend django reinhardt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury led to reinhardt 's unique style born one hundred years ago , manouche jazz legend django reinhardt is often considered the best jazz guitarist of all time .
france is honoring the musician with concerts , special edition cds and tv programs . the city of paris has even named a town square after jazz guru guitarist jean " django " reinhardt to mark the centennial of his birth on january 23 .
rheinhardt , who was born in belgium but grew up near paris , is considered the father of european jazz and developed a unique style of guitar-playing after suffering injuries to his left hand . while revered for music pioneered in the 1930s , django 's distinctive guitar swing remains popular in france today , with many non-sintis embracing his style .
but it 's french-sinti , or manouches , as they 're known there , who are really fanning the django flame . one musical manouche family is the maillies , who live in a paris suburb .
sitting in their caravan near an obsolete factory , 23-year-old vincent holds a guitar , while his stepfather bayo tunes his own .
vincent 's mother and sisters circle around and listen as he and bayo begin playing a reinhardt favorite , " i ca n't give you anything but love . " " this music is who we are , even if we ca n't play it well , " vincent explained .
" everyone in my family plays the guitar .
this music is our trade-mark - something the manouches invented , and it was django who did it . " tragedy turned into triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt 's manouche jazz enjoys a strong following reinhardt lived in manouche encampments during most of his youth , learning to play banjo , guitar and violin at a young age .
a fire in his caravan at age 18 badly burned the musician 's body - paralyzing his right leg and rendering the third and fourth fingers of his left hand virtually useless . miraculously , after rehabilitation , reinhardt was able to walk again with the aid of a cane .
originally told his guitar-playing days were over , his left-hand handicap prompted him to develop a completely new music technique .
he used the uninjured fingers of his left hand , and particularly his thumb , to play his guitar solos , employing the two injured digits only for chord work . part of django 's own genius was his blend of the new orleans jazz of the 1920s , french waltzes -lrb- valses musettes -rrb- and sinti music .
all of it flowed into what came to be known as " gypsy swing . " in 1934 , reinhardt , along with parisian violinist stephane grappelli , formed the quintette de hot club de france , which included django 's brother joseph alongside roger chaput on guitar , and louis vola on bass .
pierre ferret sometimes replaced chaput . together , the quintette de hot club helped put europe on the jazz map , and the group became one of the few famous jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments . gypsy swing lives on while masses of roma and sinti were murdered by the nazis , django managed to survive world war ii in paris , reportedly enjoying the protection of a luftwaffe officer who admired his musical talents .
during his career , reinhardt - who favored the unusual selmer-maccaferri guitar - played with jazz greats coleman hawkins , louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie , among others .
countless other musicians have named reinhardt as having a major impact on their work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : django in new york in 1946 and even now , one hundred years after his birth , and over fifty years after his death at age 43 , django 's sound lives on .
some of france 's best loved jazz artists are manouche guitarists like christian escoude and bireli lagrene .
" gypsy jazz " plays all the time on french radio , and manouche jazz venues are cropping up all around paris .
the oldest is chope aux puces , run by marcel campion , who has also opened a manouche guitar school above the club . " what characterizes this music is a rhythmical style of accompaniment we call ' the pump , " ' campion noted .
" it 's rare for musicians to master it .
it 's a manouche jazz thing .
but once you can do ' the pump , ' you can do everything . " not only did django reinhardt invent this strumming , or " pump , " effect , campion said , but " most of the chords used by jazz guitarists today were invented by django after he reinterpreted chords for five fingers for three .
that made them simpler , which , for jazz , was better .
also , he gave this music an attitude . " awakening a new generation frangy delporte , a 28-year-old up-and-coming manouche jazz star , clearly has some of that attitude , and has performed at paris 's best-known jazz venues , like the duc des lombards .
he sports slicked-back hair , just like django . " i 've been listening to django ever since i was little because of my uncle .
that 's all he ever listened to , " delporte recalled .
" later on , i got into techno , dance , that sort of thing and then , all of a sudden , i picked up a guitar and started to try to play django 's tunes .
i started listening to his music all the time .
it touched me and made me want to play . " perhaps it 's the ability to reveal the musical sensibilities in people that is another of reinhardt 's legacies , after all , his nickname " django " is romani for " i awake .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

once a year top politicians , entrepreneurs and celebrities descend on davos for the world economic forum .
our correspondent imogen foulkes tells us what the ' bronzed and blow-dried ' get up to in the swiss alpine resort . the world economic forum has , of course , a most lofty aim - improving the state of the world .
and this year , as if that was n't ambitious enough , another slogan has been tagged on to the end " rethink , redesign , rebuild . "
i 'm sure haiti 's population will be comforted to know that , thousands of miles away in the snowy alps , some of the richest people on the planet are getting together to talk about rebuilding .
so what is davos really like ?
that 's what friends ask me when i come back .
and the reason they are so curious is because ordinary people simply have no chance of ever attending the forum .
it 's a high security , invitation-only-event and the center of davos is closed to everyone else .
so to answer the question , what 's it really like ? - it 's quite surreal , an event of the most bizarre contrasts . when i go davos , the last stage of the journey is made in a little red alpine train .
it winds its way through the snow , past charming wooden chalets , lights winking in the winter darkness .
normally this train is full of schoolchildren going home , or skiers returning from the slopes - but not during the week of the forum . now i 'm surrounded by people with designer suitcases , yelling into their mobile phones about ' doing breakfast ' or ' setting up some face time . ' davos days are always busy for journalists .
there are dozens of prime ministers , chief executives of multi-nationals , chairmen of banks , heads of think tanks , even celebrities .
so who to try to interview is always a big question .
in fact , the question we should be asking ourselves is ‘ what are these people likely to say ? '
because the harsh reality is , very few major policy announcements are made at davos .
politicians tend to prefer making them on home ground , and if any international negotiations take place , they are usually conducted behind firmly closed doors .
business as usual the highlight of davos is always the keynote speaker - generally a major political figure .
this year it is france 's president nicolas sarkozy .
now this year , i must reveal , i wo n't be there , but i can predict what it will be like .
mr sarkozy will speak to an audience of the bronzed , the blow-dried , the facelifted , and the overfed .
he 'll address in some tenuous way the ' rebuild ' theme of this year 's forum - bets are on he 'll mention haiti .
but he 's unlikely to say anything radical , unexpected , or offer any firm commitments .
after that , everyone will go to lunch .
it 's hard not to feel cynical - and i 'm surprised at how many charities and non-governmental organizations have the optimism to come to davos year after year .
" these are after all the world 's most powerful people , " one aid worker tells me .
" if they make poverty or climate change an issue here , we see that as a commitment . " well , let 's wait and see - firm decisions are rarely taken at davos , and when the five-day forum winds up on january 31 , and the designer suits and fur coats disappear from the streets , the little red train will take more than its fair share of millionaires back down the valley .
soon this village will return to its usual alpine quiet , and the only visitors will be the skiers .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .

social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

dw-world.de bankers surprised by extent of hre crisis private bankers in germany were surprised by the serious difficulties plaguing hypo real estate , an expert in the sector told a committee investigating the bank 's failure and subsequent bailout .

" we want clarity by the summer break , " declared economics minister rainer bruederle on thursday , addressing the government 's torturous energy policy after a meeting between the chancellery and germany 's top four energy companies .
chancellery chief of staff ronald pofalla , along with state secretaries for the economy and the environment , met the representatives of e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw for a highly anticipated meeting .
top of the agenda was the proposed extension to the life-spans of the 17 nuclear power stations operating in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests before thursday 's meeting questions have been raised recently about the safety of nuclear power , following repeated accidents at vattenfall 's nuclear power stations kruemmel and brunsbuettel in the state of schleswig-holstein , and there were protests in front of the chancellery ahead of the meeting .
delaying the decision the details of thursday 's discussion remain secret , but it seems that both sides have agreed to overturn the current law and extend nuclear power and use part of the profits to develop renewable energy .
under the current nuclear power law , all power stations would be phased out by 2022 , but environment minister norbert roettgen has apparently already begun negotiations to extend the life-spans .
the government is determined to take at least half of the extra profits from any agreed upon extension to be invested in the research and development of new technology for renewable energy .
before the meeting , roettgen told reporters , " there will be a dynamic process by which renewable energy will replace nuclear power and fossil fuels . "
the energy companies are putting pressure on the government to make its decision as soon as possible , as two of the older power stations are due for closure soon , but the government coalition is delaying a decision in the face of massive public opposition to nuclear power .
rumors have also emerged that the energy companies are not optimistic about the talks .
consumer protection minister ilse aigner also called for the extra profits that an extension would entail to be passed on to the consumer .
" the companies stand to get significant economic advantages through these extensions .
they must benefit the consumers , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronald pofalla met the heads of the energy companies " the large energy companies have been marked recently by constant price hikes and poor service , " aigner added .
she now expects clear declarations of stable prices and a safe energy supply .
opposition criticism the political opposition sharply criticized the government 's energy policy .
social democratic party leader and former environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke at a demonstration against the planned extensions in front of the chancellery , warning that extensions would exacerbate germany 's atomic waste problems .
" we 're producing more radioactive waste just to make money to dispose of old waste , " he said .
" that 's an obscene offer . "
green party leader juergen trittin accused the government of keeping its energy policy secret so that it would not affect may 's crucial state election in north rhine-westphalia .
" while the population and parliament are being left in the dark until after the nrw election , plans are being completed in the chancellery .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

berlin backs the controversial program , while some banks remain skeptical . nationalized german property lender hypo real estate plans to funnel about 210 billion euros -lrb- $ 298 million -rrb- in " toxic " assets into a so-called " bad bank " in the latter half of 2010 , with the hope of rebuilding after a devastating year .
hypo real estate is a " natural candidate " for a bad bank , according to dr. michael schroeder at the center for european economic research .
" hre is really one of the worst banks in germany .
most of the other banks are in a much better situation , " he told deutsche welle . hypo real estate nearly went under in 2009 after being heavily hit by the financial crisis .
it is now wholly owned by the german government 's soffin bank-rescue fund , which had deemed the bank too big to fail .
berlin , with help from financial institutions , kept hre afloat with some 100 billion euros in guarantees .
seven billion were paid back last year .
while the german government has thrown its support behind the bad bank program , the scheme has attracted its fair share of skeptics too .
hre aims to re-privatize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were against the government 's bank rescue the bank said the creation of a bad bank would allow it to focus on supplying credit for the real estate and public sector and " accelerate the process of preparing the group for an eventual re-privatization . "
the munich-based lender , one of germany 's biggest financial institutions , submitted its application to create a bad bank to the german government 's financial markets stabilization agency on thursday , one day before the end of a six-month period during which it could apply .
the government has said it wants to see the bank return to private ownership , but has not yet specified a time frame .
hre has said it does n't expect to garner profits before 2012 .
are " bad banks " the right solution ?
advocates of bad banks argue that they allow banks to stay in business without having to worry about old assets eroding capital .
however , many german banks are against the program on the grounds that the rules add costs for banks taking part while doing little to cut risks to shareholders .
in addition , a nationalized bank faces incentive problems , according to dr. schroeder .
" for example , the management of the bank that is under the supervision of soffin has to limit their management compensation to half a million per year , " much less than what they usually receive , which creates a disincentive , said schroeder .
meanwhile , the european commission has expressed doubts about the ability of hre to survive in its current form .
it has also criticized what it called " market disturbances " caused by the massive government bailout .
now the eu will have to sign off on whether to allow the property lender to create germany 's largest bad bank .

the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .

" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .

and for the first time in 25 years , i actually did both .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 22.01.2010 fashion label escada back on the catwalk after business facelift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escada is back from the brink after struggling with declining sales for years , escada - one of the world ’ s best-known global fashion labels - is back .
the munich-based company recently presented its first collection under its new owner , megha mittal . escada 's hopeful comeback from economic catastrophe featured 24 models , 500 guests and an indian couple worth billions .
it was the 2010-2011 winter collection for escada sport , a line that has gone through several reincarnations , the least successful of which featured garish golf and ski wear .
now the sport collection has been repositioned to appeal to young , well-heeled customers as the fashion brand tries to rid itself of its dusty image and start ringing up sales again . mini skirts , mongolian lamb , and lot of layered charcoal wool worn over bright red , yellow and turquoise tights looked great on the gaggle of leggy models strutting down the black polished runway .
the question everyone is asking is whether it all will be enough to bring the troubled company back from the brink .
according to escada 's new owner , megha mittal , it will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new owner megha mittal is keen to put her stamp on the label " i think escada has a new fashion direction which is being successfully received already , and that is a journey that will go on , " mittal said .
" i would like escada to become an iconic , global fashion brand .
it has a great heritage and will become a market leader . "
mittal is the daughter-in-law of billionaire indian steel magnate lakshmi mittal .
when she bought the company , many assumed it would be little more than a plaything .
but the 33-year-old mother of two is eager to prove the doubters wrong .
she arrived wearing an amethyst velvet dress from the new collection and sat center stage between her husband , aditya , and escada ceo bruno saelzer , whose job it is to turn the company around .
in august of last year , escada declared insolvency after losing more than 90 million euros in 2008 .
that disastrous result was just the latest in a string of bad years that saw falling sales and the failure to get bondholder support for a broad restructuring plan .
megha mittal reportedly paid 60 million euros for all of escada 's assets , operating business and shares in its subsidiaries .
now , mittal has said she wants to invest more then 30 million euros in the company and keep more than 90 percent of the global workforce of around 2,200 .
she has retained both the design team and saelzer as the firm 's ceo .
" in the past , escada had the heritage of being glamorous , colorful , a perfect fit and luxury brand , but maybe it was not up-to-date anymore , " saelzer said .
" we have changed this , and i think this will bring us success . "
saelzer has said he would like to keep escada firmly in the luxury camp , but to make it more affordable , offering more day-wear rather than the glamorous evening gowns the brand was once known for .
the company , founded by margarethe and wolfgang ley in 1976 , operates 182 of its own shops and 225 franchise stores in more than 60 countries worldwide .
moving in the right direction " we want to create a fashion statement for women who like our brand , who love our direction , who love femininity and luxury , cool glamour and a perfect fit approach .
i think tonight we can see escada moving in the right direction , " saelzer said .
a statement seconded by some of the fashion experts who crowded into the show along with buyers , suppliers and escada employees .
laura brown from the fashion department of harrod 's in london said the brand has evidently decided to become more commercial .
bildunterschrift : the label is hoping to attract new customers with its fresh approach " they have obviously been listening to their customers , " brown said .
escada 's design team responsible for the new collection can breathe a sigh of relief .
chief designer for escada sport , jeffery kong , said he was inspired by texture , but also by the new reality in the post-financial crisis world .
" i think a lot of it is about texture and how texture is combined , the way patterns are combined , but it 's not just about the clothing ; it is about the energy that goes into the clothing , " he said .
" about 12 or 18 months ago , fashion really changed because the world changed .
it is no longer about consumerism alone .
it is about the individual . "
consumers will decide nevertheless , it is the consumer that megha mittal will have to reach if escada is to climb out of its financial misery .
that 's why this week 's show was so important .
what followed was sophisticated , wearable and ultimately urban .
melissa drier of women 's wear daily , the fashion bible of the clothing industry , reported being pleasantly surprised .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 22.01.2010 haiti aid workers rely on satellite maps from german institute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the damage in port-au-prince was clearly evident at first glance for relief organizations in haiti , understanding the earthquake 's full damage is difficult .
workers only see what is immediately in front of them .
a german institute now provides satellite-based maps as a solution . a german research institution is assembling satellite images of disaster zones like haiti and converting the data into digital maps that help international aid workers assess the damage and determine the best locations to build sanitation facilities and hospitals . the maps are created by the center for satellite based crisis information -lrb- zki -rrb- , part of the german aerospace center 's remote sensing data center in cologne . " relief organizations use these images either in their headquarters or on the terrain to better organize themselves , and they can do this with the information we provide , which is initially a good road network , " said zki senior researcher olaf kranz . he added that zki also provides information on which buildings in the affected area are intact or have been destroyed . bildunterschrift : the light yellow squares denote areas less affected by the earthquake and the orange color refers to areas more than 40 percent destroyed in the disaster satellite images become useful maps after a natural disaster occurs , like the recent earthquake and aftershocks in haiti , zki researchers gather high-resolution satellite images which are so detailed that every object larger than 50 centimeters can be easily detected , kranz said .
once the images are received , they are compared with pictures taken of the same location before the catastrophe . " if you imagine an earthquake , sometimes there can be a building with a collapsed roof , " said kranz , " but in some cases you ca n't see that the roof has collapsed unless you compare the before and after . " but in the case of haiti , the earthquake was so severe that the damage was very visible , added the researcher . the satellite images are then visually interpreted into maps .
since the center does not have automatic algorithms , 25 employees do it manually on the computer and assemble the data into color-coded grid cells .
the lighter yellow colors denote areas that were less destroyed in the disaster and the orange color means that more than 40 percent of the area was destroyed . " this should be an indication for relief organizations where to focus their work , " kranz said .
in addition , the maps are populated with red dots that the center calls potential gathering areas .
these are points where the red cross and other organizations can build facilities or hospitals . bildunterschrift : the red dots indicate locations where international aid organizations can set up their facilities cooperation with the red cross for several years the center has been providing the red cross with such satellite data and maps , said joachim jaeger , the berlin-based red cross logistics coordinator for haiti . " as soon as something happens , we immediately get in contact with zki and that means it 's an emergency and it 's a priority to create maps of an affected area , " he said . once the maps are received , the red cross then sends out its delegates into the field with the information , and material for basic healthcare and mobile hospitals .
normally , those on the scene of a disaster have a limited view , jaeger added , and this data allows the workers to see what 's around them .
the workers in the field then use the data to look for usable roads , measure the extent of the damage and identify the existing infrastructure . in the case of the haiti quake on january 12 , jaeger said , the red cross received the first maps within 18 to 24 hours of the event and used them to decide where to set up their facilities .
since then , zki researchers have constantly been sending updated maps . according to kranz , the project of converting satellite data into topographic maps began around 1999 , and in 2002 and 2003 the center began producing maps especially for relief organizations working on the ground in disaster zones .
but in comparison with other natural catastrophes , haiti seems to be practically in a league of its own . " we never saw large areas so totally destroyed like in the area of port-au-prince , " he said , citing the 2004 indian ocean tsunami as the only comparable disaster . author : alina dain editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

this gives the peace process another chance .
it ran into trouble last year when the maoists left the government .
now , at the last minute , the maoists have also called off a general strike planned for next week . nepal 's three major political parties say they will make another attempt to break the deadlock between the maoists and the other parties .
the un has extended the mandate of its nepal mission unmin accordingly , hoping that the parties also finally agree on the integration of former maoist combatants into the army .
19,000 of these ex-guerilla fighters are still living in unmin-supervised camps .
unmin spokesperson kosmos biswokarma says , " the political parties have concluded between themselves that they will be able to solve the integration issue within the deadline of the new constitution , i.e. may 28 , 2010 . "
the plight of the former combatants has been controversial since the end of the civil war .
the generals and politicians of other parties do n't want the maoists in the army .
deep divide but since may last year , the divide has grown deeper .
at that time , maoist supremo pushpa kamal dahal resigned as nepal 's prime minister after failing to dismiss the army chief .
the maoists , who had become the strongest party in the 2008 elections , were suddenly in the opposition .
they began mobilizing their supporters in the streets against the new government .
the work of the constituent assembly was seriously affected .
but nepali author and democracy activist manjushree thapa says , " there is so much interest in making the process succeed .
india , who is the major player in the peace process in nepal , and the united nations and other international organizations and partners will make sure that something that resembles a peace process will happen . "
" the only problem will be : is it going to be satisfactory or not ?
when the peace process began in 2006 , there were very high hopes for it .
and now it ’ s turned into a very sad and sorry process , where just if anything happens , if we just don ’ t go back to war , people are willing to call it a success .
so the standard has really lowered ! "
trouble started after election many observers believe the maoists ' surprising election victory in 2008 triggered the crisis .
the maoists claimed a leadership role for themselves .
and after the first shock had passed , the other parties decided not to let that happen .
they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .

they have the backing of powerful neighbor india , according to manjushree thapa .
she explains , " india , i think , supported the peace process with a very confident sense that the maoists would always be a junior partner in government , because , of course , india has its own big maoist movement .
and for them , the experiment in nepal is very crucial , because if they can bring the nepali maoists in as a junior partner in government and turn them into a democratic party , that becomes something they can show their own maoists in india and say , ‘ look , this is what we can do for you if you come into a peace process ! ’ "
however , just recently , nepal 's maoists launched an anti-india campaign .
the manifest distrust between them and new delhi does not bode well for the future of the peace process in kathmandu .

it is a dangerous job because ships are often attacked by pirates these days .
that 's why anti-pirate training has become mandatory and the seamen are accepting it with open arms . up to 40 percent of all container vessel and oil tanker crews are filipinos .
that means around 400,000 filipino sailors need to be trained .
sailors ' unions , shipping companies and the filipino government have agreed on the anti-pirate training scheme which has become mandatory for anyone hired onto a ship .
and the sailors welcome it .
renato elano , a sailor looking for employment on a ship , says dealing with pirates has become an every-day challenge .
" say you are a chief officer on duty , you must be on full alert .
you must know all the surrounding vessels .
you know a pirate boat when you see one ; they are fast running vessels .
once you see one , you must send a message to alarm all the vessels in the area and of course the nearest port authority . "
international maritime organization training training is based on recommendations by the london-based international maritime organization .
butch lamug , from the philippine shipping association says it is especially important to learn how to prevent pirates from getting on board : " all ships transiting the gulf of aden , are advised to follow a set of best practices issued by the international maritime organisation .
these measures include pro-active look-outs .
so it is very important that there is 24-hour look-out ; the use of deck lighting ; it is recommended also that there be some netting around the vessel .
some recommendations include electrical fencing or razor wiring of areas where the vessel can be boarded ; evasive manoeuvring ; and of course it means you have to increase your speed to at least 50 knots because it has been proven that no vessel travelling at the speed of 50 knots has been boarded .
when you go so slow , that is the time when you get boarded . "
pirate attacks are part of the job most sailors from the philippines are not afraid of pirates .
they say it is part of a sailor 's job description .
for the sailors , the pay is good enough to compensate for the dangers of pirate attacks .
a lead officer at a sailor ’ s employment agency explains there is usually a bonus for more dangerous runs , for example through the gulf of aden .
high-ranking crew members earn from 7,000 to 8,000 us dollars for 6-month contracts and for lower ranking sailors , the minimum is around 800 us dollars for 9-month contracts .
protecting the crew with arms is not an option .
they have to depend on the patrol ships in dangerous waters .
the sailors agree with not having weapons on board .
one seaman says you can not bring guns on ships because it could cause complications in the many ports .
he says it is like flying in aeroplanes : it would n't be safe to travel with guns .
if it is impossible to eradicate the pirates , teaching deck crews pirate safety is the safest bet .

advertisement international efforts to get aid to haitians continue efforts to rebuild haiti 's main port are being stepped up in an effort to ensure emergency supplies reach millions still in need of aid .
us navy and army divers are to start repairing the port 's pier on friday .
re-opening haiti 's seaport in the capital , port-au-prince , is seen as vital to the international aid effort .
millions of people remain in need after haiti 's earthquake , and plans are being made to house 400,000 survivors in new tented villages outside the capital .
the bbc 's adam mynott , in port-au-prince , says 50 % of the port was destroyed by the earthquake , but engineers have decided some parts of one pier are strong enough to handle limited amounts of cargo .
the port will be running at 10 % capacity .
but it will not be the answer in getting aid through to the quake-devastated country , our correspondent adds .
just four vessels had docked by thursday evening .
dock workers have offloaded 124 containers of humanitarian aid from ships from the us , the netherlands and france .
however , correspondents say the aid that has so far arrived at the port is being driven for 45 minutes across the city to the airport , where it is piling up and not being distributed to those who need it .
mass graves an estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake , which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people .
at the scene mark doyle , bbc news , port-au-prince the police chief of a notoriously violent part of the capital , the slum area cite soleil , has appealed for help in countering criminal gangs that escaped from the main prison during last week 's earthquake .
several hundred of some 5,000 on the run are believed to be hardened criminals belonging to haiti 's gangs .
inspector aristide rosemont says the gangs have been looting and stealing .
local people in the area confirm this - and women say they have been raped by gang members .
the police chief would n't say who he was appealing to for help , but his plea is clearly aimed at , first , the us troops who have just arrived here , and , second , the un forces that have been stationed in haiti for several years .
at least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , haiti 's government has said .
many more remain uncollected in the streets .
at least 122 people have been saved by international search-and-rescue teams , according to the us government , but hopes are now fading that anyone will be found alive underneath the rubble .
a florida-based team is reported to have left , along with others from luxembourg and the uk .
" you have to be realistic and , after nine days , reality says it is more difficult to find people alive .
but it 's not impossible , " said chilean army major rodrigo vasquez at the site of the collapsed montana hotel .
even as the aid operation remains the focus of events in haiti , a leading uk medical journal has issued a sharp critique of the way aid agencies have been operating .
in an editorial , the lancet says many of the international aid agencies operating in haiti might be doing more harm than good by promoting themselves rather than working for the common humanitarian goal .
the lancet says the aid industry has become too obsessed with media campaigns , despite past mistakes during the response to the asian tsunami five years ago .
lancet editor , dr richard horton , told the bbc there was no effective common leadership of humanitarian workers in haiti , as many non-governmental organisations were competing against each other .
improvised shelters at least 500,000 people are currently living outdoors in 447 improvised camps in port-au-prince , according to the international organisation for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
tents will not work in may when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice vincent houver , international organisation for migration us navy shows sensitive side misguided fears of violence how to manage a crisis what is delaying aid ?
of the 350 settlements assessed by the iom , its partners and the haitian government , only 179 had improvised shelter material and tents , and only three had access to potable water , the iom said .
the geneva-based un body said it was distributing tents , blankets and plastic sheeting provided by the us , japan and turkey , but warned that more permanent shelter would soon be needed .
" tents will not work in may when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice , " said iom chief of mission vincent houver .
" assessments must take place and best construction methods and durable materials need to be discussed , " he added .
in a bid to deliver greater quantities of aid , the us military is now operating at four airports in the area - port-au-prince and jacmel in haiti , and san isidro and barahona in the neighbouring dominican republic .

the airport , which is under us military control , has only one 2,900m -lrb- 9,600ft -rrb- runway .
the us military is currently giving the " highest priority " to shipments of water donations to help meet the " overwhelming " need for water .
medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has said five of its planes carrying a total of 77 tonnes of medical and relief supplies have been turned away in the past week .
only one has been able to land .
security concerns are also limiting the delivery of aid by road from the dominican republic .
the bbc 's gary duffy , who is at the border with haiti , says only two convoys guarded by un troops are entering haiti each day .
the us and the un world food programme insist the distribution of food and water is well under way , but bbc correspondents in port-au-prince say many people have still seen no international relief at all .
