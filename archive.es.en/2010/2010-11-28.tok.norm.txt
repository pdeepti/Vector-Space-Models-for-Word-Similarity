the bailout also includes bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark . finance ministers from the 16 eurozone countries have approved a multi-billion-euro rescue package for ireland and its embattled economy .
" the final agreed program represents the best available deal for ireland , " said irish prime minister brian cowen .
" it allows us to move forward with secure funding for our essential public services , for our welfare state , for the most vulnerable members of society that depend on them .
" and it provides ireland with vital time and space to successfully and conclusively address the unprecedented problems we have been dealing with since this global economic crisis began , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers had plenty of details to hash out team effort to bridge budget gap a team of specialists from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- hammered out a deal in dublin earlier sunday for an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 112.5-billion -rrb- package of loans to bridge a massive budget deficit and cover looming bank debts in ireland .
dutch finance minister jan-kees de jager said the international monetary fund , the eurozone nations and the european commission will all be involved in the bailout , adding that it will also include bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark .
" we are standing foursquare behind the euro and for stability in the eurozone , " de jager told reporters on sunday .
another eurozone rescue deal investors are worried that the troubled economies of portugal and spain could follow ireland , and german and french officials called for a rapid conclusion to the irish talks to put an end to the uncertainty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second massive bailout the bloc has had to pay this year at a meeting of finance ministers in brussels on sunday , all 27 eu nations ratified the eurozone plan to grant financial assistance . they also approved the basis of a future crisis-resolution mechanism proposed by paris and berlin . germany and france have been keen to outline details of the permanent crisis mechanism , which was outlined only broadly last month .
uncertainty about precisely how such a mechanism would work , with concern about private investors having to sustain losses , is believed to have contributed to the irish crisis . case by case liability for investors under the terms , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that private bondholders could be made to share the burden of future sovereign debt restructuring , adding that this would be decided on a case by casis - rather than an automatic - basis . decisions about whether bondholders would have to contribute would be decided in accordance with imf rules , rehn said . this irish rescue package will be the second such deal for a eurozone country this year after the eu and the imf gave greece 110 billion euros in aid in may .
as in the case of greece , the irish package hinges on an austerity plan unveiled last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen faces intense pressure to stand down over the deal that four-year plan includes 10 billion euros in spending cuts , 5 billion euros in tax hikes and the slashing of 25,000 public sector jobs .
cowen said ireland expects to pay an average interest rate of 5.8 percent a year on the loans , although this would be subject to market conditions .
he added that this was a better rate than dublin could expect on the financial markets .
protestors in dublin denounced the bailout and austerity measures on saturday , waving signs saying " eire not for sale , not to the imf " and " there is a better , fairer way . "
cowen has also faced intense pressure to quit .
his party fianna fail lost a by-election on friday , narrowing their coalition 's parliamentary majority to a precarious two seats .

the poll comes as the country struggles to recover from its recent banking crisis . icelandic voters went at the polls on saturday to vote for an assembly of ordinary people who will shape the country 's first-ever independently drafted constitution .
up to 523 candidates are contesting a place on an assembly of between 25 and 31 people who will work on a charter to replace the one adopted when iceland became independent from denmark in 1944 .
there is no requirement that people on the assembly have university degrees .
iceland has since adhered to a customized version of denmark 's constitution with some extra clauses added and the icelandic president , rather than the danish monarch , referred to as head of state .
a spokesman for the icelandic justice ministry told the news agency afp on saturday that it expected some 50 percent of the electorate to take part in the vote .
radical alterations expected the assembly is expected to radically alter the current contract between state and citizen , considering suggestions put forward by 1,000 randomly chosen citizens aged from 18 to 89 years old .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigurdardottir hopes a new constitution will mark a new start for the country proposals include the separation of church and state as well and the public ownership of all natural resources .
there is also a call for a clear separation of the legislative branch of government from the executive .
although the decisions are not binding , the government has indicated that a well-drafted and unanimous proposal would probably be " morally binding . "
prime minister of iceland johanna sigurdardottir has said she hoped that the revised constitution would establish a new social contract that would contribute to national reconciliation .
early resistance to crisis measures sigurdardottir 's comments follow public anger against the political elite over the collapse of one of the country 's major banks , landesbanki , and the subsequent handling of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icelandic people took to the street earlier this year iceland was one of the first countries in europe to see widespread public resistance to government measures aimed at dealing with the banking sector collapse and global financial downturn .
the icelandic capital reykjavik was the scene of demonstrations in march ahead of a public referendum on a government plan to compensate the dutch and british governments over the failure of icesave , a landesbanki subsidiary .
icelandic voters subsequently rejected the proposed compensation package .
results of the vote are not expected to be announced until monday .

wulff also said his country had a " responsibility " regarding israel 's security .
" germany considers that it has a responsibility concerning israel 's right to exist and to security , " he said .
peres also called for peace through a two-state solution and thanked germany for its support .
later on sunday wulff is set to meet with israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.11.2010 eu finance ministers agree to irish bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials do n't want the irish crisis to drag the euro down with it eu finance ministers have agreed on a 85-billion-euro rescue package to help ireland overcome its debt crisis .
the bailout also includes bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark . finance ministers from the 16 eurozone countries have approved a multi-billion-euro rescue package for ireland and its embattled economy .
" the final agreed program represents the best available deal for ireland , " said irish prime minister brian cowen .
" it allows us to move forward with secure funding for our essential public services , for our welfare state , for the most vulnerable members of society that depend on them .
" and it provides ireland with vital time and space to successfully and conclusively address the unprecedented problems we have been dealing with since this global economic crisis began , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers had plenty of details to hash out team effort to bridge budget gap a team of specialists from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- hammered out a deal in dublin earlier sunday for an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 112.5-billion -rrb- package of loans to bridge a massive budget deficit and cover looming bank debts in ireland .
dutch finance minister jan-kees de jager said the international monetary fund , the eurozone nations and the european commission will all be involved in the bailout , adding that it will also include bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark .
" we are standing foursquare behind the euro and for stability in the eurozone , " de jager told reporters on sunday .
another eurozone rescue deal investors are worried that the troubled economies of portugal and spain could follow ireland , and german and french officials called for a rapid conclusion to the irish talks to put an end to the uncertainty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second massive bailout the bloc has had to pay this year at a meeting of finance ministers in brussels on sunday , all 27 eu nations ratified the eurozone plan to grant financial assistance . they also approved the basis of a future crisis-resolution mechanism proposed by paris and berlin . germany and france have been keen to outline details of the permanent crisis mechanism , which was outlined only broadly last month .
uncertainty about precisely how such a mechanism would work , with concern about private investors having to sustain losses , is believed to have contributed to the irish crisis . case by case liability for investors under the terms , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that private bondholders could be made to share the burden of future sovereign debt restructuring , adding that this would be decided on a case by casis - rather than an automatic - basis . decisions about whether bondholders would have to contribute would be decided in accordance with imf rules , rehn said . this irish rescue package will be the second such deal for a eurozone country this year after the eu and the imf gave greece 110 billion euros in aid in may .
as in the case of greece , the irish package hinges on an austerity plan unveiled last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen faces intense pressure to stand down over the deal that four-year plan includes 10 billion euros in spending cuts , 5 billion euros in tax hikes and the slashing of 25,000 public sector jobs .
cowen said ireland expects to pay an average interest rate of 5.8 percent a year on the loans , although this would be subject to market conditions .
he added that this was a better rate than dublin could expect on the financial markets .
protestors in dublin denounced the bailout and austerity measures on saturday , waving signs saying " eire not for sale , not to the imf " and " there is a better , fairer way . "
cowen has also faced intense pressure to quit .
his party fianna fail lost a by-election on friday , narrowing their coalition 's parliamentary majority to a precarious two seats .

wulff 's 17-year-old daughter and other german teenagers are accompanying him on his first trip to israel since entering office , characterized by the government as an official , but not state visit .
the involvement of the teenagers is meant to underscore germany 's commitment to passing on the memory of the holocaust to a younger generation of germans .

" germany considers that it has a responsibility concerning israel 's right to exist and to security , " he said .

iceland has since adhered to a customized version of denmark 's constitution with some extra clauses added and the icelandic president , rather than the danish monarch , referred to as head of state .
a spokesman for the icelandic justice ministry told the news agency afp on saturday that it expected some 50 percent of the electorate to take part in the vote .
radical alterations expected the assembly is expected to radically alter the current contract between state and citizen , considering suggestions put forward by 1,000 randomly chosen citizens aged from 18 to 89 years old .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigurdardottir hopes a new constitution will mark a new start for the country proposals include the separation of church and state as well and the public ownership of all natural resources .
there is also a call for a clear separation of the legislative branch of government from the executive .
although the decisions are not binding , the government has indicated that a well-drafted and unanimous proposal would probably be " morally binding . "
prime minister of iceland johanna sigurdardottir has said she hoped that the revised constitution would establish a new social contract that would contribute to national reconciliation .
early resistance to crisis measures sigurdardottir 's comments follow public anger against the political elite over the collapse of one of the country 's major banks , landesbanki , and the subsequent handling of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icelandic people took to the street earlier this year iceland was one of the first countries in europe to see widespread public resistance to government measures aimed at dealing with the banking sector collapse and global financial downturn .
the icelandic capital reykjavik was the scene of demonstrations in march ahead of a public referendum on a government plan to compensate the dutch and british governments over the failure of icesave , a landesbanki subsidiary .
icelandic voters subsequently rejected the proposed compensation package .
results of the vote are not expected to be announced until monday .

the proposal , put forth by the nationalist swiss people ’ s party , has been criticized by human rights groups . swiss voters have approved a far-right initiative to automatically expel foreign residents convicted of serious crimes , according to poll results .

foreigners make up more than a fifth of switzerland 's population of 7.7 million , and according to official figures are disproportionately charged with crimes .
growing support for svp the svp has become one of switzerland 's biggest political movements in recent years , garnering support by playing on the rising fear about immigration .

the bailout also includes bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark . finance ministers from the 16 eurozone countries have approved a multi-billion-euro rescue package for ireland and its embattled economy .
" the final agreed program represents the best available deal for ireland , " said irish prime minister brian cowen .
" it allows us to move forward with secure funding for our essential public services , for our welfare state , for the most vulnerable members of society that depend on them .
" and it provides ireland with vital time and space to successfully and conclusively address the unprecedented problems we have been dealing with since this global economic crisis began , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers had plenty of details to hash out team effort to bridge budget gap a team of specialists from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- hammered out a deal in dublin earlier sunday for an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 112.5-billion -rrb- package of loans to bridge a massive budget deficit and cover looming bank debts in ireland .
dutch finance minister jan-kees de jager said the international monetary fund , the eurozone nations and the european commission will all be involved in the bailout , adding that it will also include bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark .
" we are standing foursquare behind the euro and for stability in the eurozone , " de jager told reporters on sunday .
another eurozone rescue deal investors are worried that the troubled economies of portugal and spain could follow ireland , and german and french officials called for a rapid conclusion to the irish talks to put an end to the uncertainty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second massive bailout the bloc has had to pay this year at a meeting of finance ministers in brussels on sunday , all 27 eu nations ratified the eurozone plan to grant financial assistance . they also approved the basis of a future crisis-resolution mechanism proposed by paris and berlin . germany and france have been keen to outline details of the permanent crisis mechanism , which was outlined only broadly last month .
uncertainty about precisely how such a mechanism would work , with concern about private investors having to sustain losses , is believed to have contributed to the irish crisis . case by case liability for investors under the terms , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that private bondholders could be made to share the burden of future sovereign debt restructuring , adding that this would be decided on a case by casis - rather than an automatic - basis . decisions about whether bondholders would have to contribute would be decided in accordance with imf rules , rehn said . this irish rescue package will be the second such deal for a eurozone country this year after the eu and the imf gave greece 110 billion euros in aid in may .
as in the case of greece , the irish package hinges on an austerity plan unveiled last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen faces intense pressure to stand down over the deal that four-year plan includes 10 billion euros in spending cuts , 5 billion euros in tax hikes and the slashing of 25,000 public sector jobs .
cowen said ireland expects to pay an average interest rate of 5.8 percent a year on the loans , although this would be subject to market conditions .
he added that this was a better rate than dublin could expect on the financial markets .
protestors in dublin denounced the bailout and austerity measures on saturday , waving signs saying " eire not for sale , not to the imf " and " there is a better , fairer way . "
cowen has also faced intense pressure to quit .
his party fianna fail lost a by-election on friday , narrowing their coalition 's parliamentary majority to a precarious two seats .

" as long as wikileaks holds such material , the violation of the law is ongoing . " us officials said kohl was responding to a letter from assange asking for the names of individuals who might be " at significant risk of harm " because of the document release .
kohl responded that assange 's actions would endanger the lives of " countless innocent individuals .

diplomats have also warned leaders in israel and canada . us ambassador to germany philip murphy told the sunday edition of the tabloid newspaper bild that it was difficult to predict what repercussions the release would have .
" at the very least it will be uncomfortable he said , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murphy says the german-us relationship is not at risk " we often speak with contacts and try to understand what 's going on in our host country and then we report home with what we 're hearing and sometimes what we think , " he told the newspaper regarding the memos to the state department from the embassies around the world . bild is reporting that the cables are particularly critical of german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who supposedly is described as being politically weak .
chancellor angela merkel also got a negative review , according to bild , although somewhat less so . murphy said , however , that he remains optimistic .
" i 'm sure that the friendship between the us and germany will survive this challenge , " he is quoted as saying . breach of confidence us ambassador to iraq james jeffrey told reporters that the release would undermine trust in the us as a diplomatic partner . " wikileaks are an absolutely awful impediment to my business , which is to be able to have discussions in confidence with people , " he said .
" they will not help ; they will simply hurt our ability to do our work here . " the italian government said it was worried about " possible negative repercussions for italy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 28.11.2010 africa 's lost elite sit on packed bags in morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a fraction of illegal migrants make it to european soil , like these men in spain refugee policies will be on the agenda at the africa-eu summit in tripoli beginning monday .
a major problem in most african countries is that well-educated people ca n't find a job and head towards europe 's borders . tens of thousands of africans every year continue to make the perilous journey across the mediterranean sea in search of work and a better life in europe .
for many illegal migrants from sub-saharan africa , though , a stopover in northern africa can turn into a sojourn lasting many years .
over the past decade , the european union has increasingly involved border countries in its battle against illegal immigration .
the bloc has tightened measures directed toward stopping migrants from entering europe but also helped with action aimed at stopping them from even leaving african territory .
morocco is a prime example of this development .
" the measures led by the european union to fight against irregular immigration have greatly contributed to the transformation of morocco from a transit country to a destination country , in this way making it a ' buffer zone ' , " said gadem , an ngo based in the moroccan capital rabat , which monitors the treatment of migrants by the country 's authorities .
active members of society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most illegal migrants hope they will make it to europe one day the number of irregular migrants in morocco is estimated between 10,000 and 20,000 people , according to figures cited by the international organization for migration .
these refugees in morocco are not the poorest of the poor , either .
they are the ones who had professions and were active members of their communities .
they are the ones who could build up development , infrastructure and efficient administrations back home - but they often failed due to cronyism and corruption .
aliyu is a typical example .
like all illegal migrants interviewed for this report , he declined to provide his full name .
the 28-year-old studied chemistry back in his native country , guinea .
but after his studies , he could n't find a job .
so he went to morocco , hoping to use it as a stepping stone to get to europe .
but that hope has not come true yet ; he 's still stuck in rabat .
he said he wished europe would use clear policies to increase pressure on african nations so that so many people would n't even have to leave their home countries .
" morocco plays the cop for europe , " aliyu said .
" but i think the eu should truly reconsider its development policies toward african countries .
what is it really about for the thousands of people from mali or guinea here ?
they 're looking for a better life and for work .
that 's why the collaboration with the countries of origin has to change . "
speaking the same language this cooperation is also one of the topics leaders from the european union and africa will address at the two-day africa-eu summit in the libyan capital beginning monday .
it is the third summit of this kind and developed out of the africa-eu joint strategy adopted by 80 african and european leaders in lisbon in december 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal migrants live in constant fear of being caught according to the european commission , the joint strategy has allowed both sides to address migration issues in a more productive manner .
" the partnership has created a forum for open exchanges in a sensitive and complex policy area , " the commission said in a statement earlier this week .
it conceded , though , that immediate results were " difficult to measure . "
" but the tone and nature of the debate has positively evolved over recent years , " the commission said .
" today , participants speak to a large extent the same language , and they increasingly share the same analysis . "
effective immigration policies merely improving the tone , though , is not enough for refugees like aliyu .
he is one of the founders of the " council of african refugees . "
though not recognized by the government , it wants to be a common forum and voice for migrants .
the organization is also campaigning for morocco to finally get effective refugee and integration policies going .
ngos like gadem report of systematic human rights abuses against migrants by moroccan security forces .
they have called on the moroccan government to view migration not only as a security problem , but also one that concerns moroccan politics , business and society as a whole .
gadem 's spokesman hicham rachidi said it does n't help anyone to confront the problem with deportation and denial - not the migrants , not europe and not morocco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachidi says morocco has to exert more effort to ensure migrants ' rights " it 's like them pouring water on sand , " rachidi said .
" it simply seeps away and leads to nothing . "
aliyu 's roommate mahamadou , who is also involved in the council , is originally from mali and has been living without papers in rabat for several years .
though he studied chemistry , he now works as an electrician , earning about seven euros -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- a day illegally .
he said structural changes in eu-african relations on this issue were necessary .
" the money that is supposed to help us develop never reaches us , " mahamadou said .
" so i wish that donors would have direct contact to those people it actually affects . "
aliyu , mahamadou and others stress that the situation in their native countries must improve .
they would like to see development aid from europe more closely tied to certain conditions and communities instead of being dependent on governments .
in 2009 , the european commission dedicated 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- - around 42 percent of its total disbursed aid - to africa .
" i wish the europeans , if they themselves do n't want any refugees , would help these people in their countries much more directly in order to further development there , " mahamadou said .
" then none of us would risk our lives in the desert or the ocean . "
willing to take risks even if there were positive developments in aid structure , the problem of illegal migration will certainly continue .
migrants want to reach european soil - be it mainland europe , the spanish enclaves of ceuta and melilla or islands in the atlantic and mediterranean - and are willing to risk people smugglers , deserts , sea crossings and the possibility of being sent home , all for the dream of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees in oujda live in makeshift camps in the nearby forests " life is all about risk , but the greatest risk is not to take a risk at all , " said 39-year-old justin .
" so you must take the risk in order to survive . "
the engineer is from the delta state in nigeria and has been stuck in oujda close to the algerian border for three years .
this is a particularly tough terrain .
it 's much more difficult to find work than in rabat , though the sub-saharan african refugees help each other out where they can .
their largest risk is being caught by the moroccan police .
in oujda , taxi drivers are forbidden from transporting sub-saharan africans .
for these migrants with dark skin , it 's better to make themselves invisible in oujda .
aliyu said there are often police raids , whether it 's in oujda or rabat .
" they search the refugees and take away their money and telephones , " he said .
" then they put them on a truck like animals and dump them again on the other side of the algerian border . "
often , they are led back into the desert , he said .
" there in the sahara , it 's really awful , " aliyu said .
" there 's no water , nothing to eat .
it 's horrible and many of our friends have lost their lives there . "
he said moroccan authorities still have n't recognized that their country has long been a place for sub-saharan africans to live and work .
it was high time for effective integration policies .

a major problem in most african countries is that well-educated people ca n't find a job and head towards europe 's borders . tens of thousands of africans every year continue to make the perilous journey across the mediterranean sea in search of work and a better life in europe .
for many illegal migrants from sub-saharan africa , though , a stopover in northern africa can turn into a sojourn lasting many years .
over the past decade , the european union has increasingly involved border countries in its battle against illegal immigration .
the bloc has tightened measures directed toward stopping migrants from entering europe but also helped with action aimed at stopping them from even leaving african territory .
morocco is a prime example of this development .
" the measures led by the european union to fight against irregular immigration have greatly contributed to the transformation of morocco from a transit country to a destination country , in this way making it a ' buffer zone ' , " said gadem , an ngo based in the moroccan capital rabat , which monitors the treatment of migrants by the country 's authorities .
active members of society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most illegal migrants hope they will make it to europe one day the number of irregular migrants in morocco is estimated between 10,000 and 20,000 people , according to figures cited by the international organization for migration .
these refugees in morocco are not the poorest of the poor , either .
they are the ones who had professions and were active members of their communities .
they are the ones who could build up development , infrastructure and efficient administrations back home - but they often failed due to cronyism and corruption .
aliyu is a typical example .
like all illegal migrants interviewed for this report , he declined to provide his full name .
the 28-year-old studied chemistry back in his native country , guinea .
but after his studies , he could n't find a job .
so he went to morocco , hoping to use it as a stepping stone to get to europe .
but that hope has not come true yet ; he 's still stuck in rabat .
he said he wished europe would use clear policies to increase pressure on african nations so that so many people would n't even have to leave their home countries .
" morocco plays the cop for europe , " aliyu said .
" but i think the eu should truly reconsider its development policies toward african countries .
what is it really about for the thousands of people from mali or guinea here ?
they 're looking for a better life and for work .
that 's why the collaboration with the countries of origin has to change . "
speaking the same language this cooperation is also one of the topics leaders from the european union and africa will address at the two-day africa-eu summit in the libyan capital beginning monday .
it is the third summit of this kind and developed out of the africa-eu joint strategy adopted by 80 african and european leaders in lisbon in december 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal migrants live in constant fear of being caught according to the european commission , the joint strategy has allowed both sides to address migration issues in a more productive manner .
" the partnership has created a forum for open exchanges in a sensitive and complex policy area , " the commission said in a statement earlier this week .
it conceded , though , that immediate results were " difficult to measure . "
" but the tone and nature of the debate has positively evolved over recent years , " the commission said .
" today , participants speak to a large extent the same language , and they increasingly share the same analysis . "
effective immigration policies merely improving the tone , though , is not enough for refugees like aliyu .
he is one of the founders of the " council of african refugees . "
though not recognized by the government , it wants to be a common forum and voice for migrants .
the organization is also campaigning for morocco to finally get effective refugee and integration policies going .
ngos like gadem report of systematic human rights abuses against migrants by moroccan security forces .
they have called on the moroccan government to view migration not only as a security problem , but also one that concerns moroccan politics , business and society as a whole .
gadem 's spokesman hicham rachidi said it does n't help anyone to confront the problem with deportation and denial - not the migrants , not europe and not morocco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachidi says morocco has to exert more effort to ensure migrants ' rights " it 's like them pouring water on sand , " rachidi said .
" it simply seeps away and leads to nothing . "
aliyu 's roommate mahamadou , who is also involved in the council , is originally from mali and has been living without papers in rabat for several years .
though he studied chemistry , he now works as an electrician , earning about seven euros -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- a day illegally .
he said structural changes in eu-african relations on this issue were necessary .
" the money that is supposed to help us develop never reaches us , " mahamadou said .
" so i wish that donors would have direct contact to those people it actually affects . "
aliyu , mahamadou and others stress that the situation in their native countries must improve .
they would like to see development aid from europe more closely tied to certain conditions and communities instead of being dependent on governments .
in 2009 , the european commission dedicated 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- - around 42 percent of its total disbursed aid - to africa .
" i wish the europeans , if they themselves do n't want any refugees , would help these people in their countries much more directly in order to further development there , " mahamadou said .
" then none of us would risk our lives in the desert or the ocean . "
willing to take risks even if there were positive developments in aid structure , the problem of illegal migration will certainly continue .
migrants want to reach european soil - be it mainland europe , the spanish enclaves of ceuta and melilla or islands in the atlantic and mediterranean - and are willing to risk people smugglers , deserts , sea crossings and the possibility of being sent home , all for the dream of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees in oujda live in makeshift camps in the nearby forests " life is all about risk , but the greatest risk is not to take a risk at all , " said 39-year-old justin .
" so you must take the risk in order to survive . "
the engineer is from the delta state in nigeria and has been stuck in oujda close to the algerian border for three years .
this is a particularly tough terrain .
it 's much more difficult to find work than in rabat , though the sub-saharan african refugees help each other out where they can .
their largest risk is being caught by the moroccan police .
in oujda , taxi drivers are forbidden from transporting sub-saharan africans .
for these migrants with dark skin , it 's better to make themselves invisible in oujda .
aliyu said there are often police raids , whether it 's in oujda or rabat .
" they search the refugees and take away their money and telephones , " he said .
" then they put them on a truck like animals and dump them again on the other side of the algerian border . "
often , they are led back into the desert , he said .
" there in the sahara , it 's really awful , " aliyu said .
" there 's no water , nothing to eat .
it 's horrible and many of our friends have lost their lives there . "
he said moroccan authorities still have n't recognized that their country has long been a place for sub-saharan africans to live and work .
it was high time for effective integration policies .

licensing agreements will keep the brand alive internationally , while the family-run company builds its business at home . german brewer warsteiner has ended its direct involvement in the international market by selling its argentinan subsidiary isenbeck – founded in 1994 – to british beer giant sabmiller .
the sale marks the end of the privately held company 's push to shed its foreign operations , especially in regions subject to political volatility .
in 2008 it turned three production facilities in africa over to the french castel group .
warsteiner beer will still be available around the world through licensing agreements with other brewers .
the global market for beer is largely pinned down by large companies like , sabmiller , inbev , heineken and carlsberg .
steffan leppin , a press speaker for warsteiner , said competing for additional market share was futile for the mid-sized company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian beer isenbeck was the last of warsteiner 's foreign holdings " a mid-sized company like the warsteiner group – we 're dwarves by comparison – ca n't hold out in the long term , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we have partners who carry our brand in their portfolios , then that 's certainly an advantage . "
expansion in germany likely despite the change in strategy , international turnover via licensing remains an important component of warsteiner 's business , leppin said .
the company wants to focus on europe and north america , and is likely to buy brands within germany in the future .
" we 're a classic family-run company , " he said .
" we have a healthy core and good liquidity . "
warsteiner was founded in 1753 by antonius cramer in the north-rhein westphalian city of warstein and remains in the hands of his family .
catharina cramer , who became the group 's executive in 2006 , said in a release that the sale will " secure the presence and quality of warsteiner in argentina for the long-term . "

the bailout also includes bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark . finance ministers from the 16 eurozone countries have approved a multi-billion-euro rescue package for ireland and its embattled economy .
" the final agreed program represents the best available deal for ireland , " said irish prime minister brian cowen .
" it allows us to move forward with secure funding for our essential public services , for our welfare state , for the most vulnerable members of society that depend on them .
" and it provides ireland with vital time and space to successfully and conclusively address the unprecedented problems we have been dealing with since this global economic crisis began , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers had plenty of details to hash out team effort to bridge budget gap a team of specialists from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- hammered out a deal in dublin earlier sunday for an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 112.5-billion -rrb- package of loans to bridge a massive budget deficit and cover looming bank debts in ireland .
dutch finance minister jan-kees de jager said the international monetary fund , the eurozone nations and the european commission will all be involved in the bailout , adding that it will also include bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark .
" we are standing foursquare behind the euro and for stability in the eurozone , " de jager told reporters on sunday .
another eurozone rescue deal investors are worried that the troubled economies of portugal and spain could follow ireland , and german and french officials called for a rapid conclusion to the irish talks to put an end to the uncertainty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second massive bailout the bloc has had to pay this year at a meeting of finance ministers in brussels on sunday , all 27 eu nations ratified the eurozone plan to grant financial assistance . they also approved the basis of a future crisis-resolution mechanism proposed by paris and berlin . germany and france have been keen to outline details of the permanent crisis mechanism , which was outlined only broadly last month .
uncertainty about precisely how such a mechanism would work , with concern about private investors having to sustain losses , is believed to have contributed to the irish crisis . case by case liability for investors under the terms , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that private bondholders could be made to share the burden of future sovereign debt restructuring , adding that this would be decided on a case by casis - rather than an automatic - basis . decisions about whether bondholders would have to contribute would be decided in accordance with imf rules , rehn said . this irish rescue package will be the second such deal for a eurozone country this year after the eu and the imf gave greece 110 billion euros in aid in may .
as in the case of greece , the irish package hinges on an austerity plan unveiled last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen faces intense pressure to stand down over the deal that four-year plan includes 10 billion euros in spending cuts , 5 billion euros in tax hikes and the slashing of 25,000 public sector jobs .
cowen said ireland expects to pay an average interest rate of 5.8 percent a year on the loans , although this would be subject to market conditions .
he added that this was a better rate than dublin could expect on the financial markets .
protestors in dublin denounced the bailout and austerity measures on saturday , waving signs saying " eire not for sale , not to the imf " and " there is a better , fairer way . "
cowen has also faced intense pressure to quit .
his party fianna fail lost a by-election on friday , narrowing their coalition 's parliamentary majority to a precarious two seats .

environmentalists say the fish stocks could be lower than estimated . a meeting of fishing nations on saturday agreed to leave catch quotas largely unchanged for the atlantic bluefin tuna .
the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- said that its 48 member states had set a 2011 quota of 12,900 metric tons , a reduction of 600 metric tons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the giant tuna is a highly valued ingredient in japan the slim reduction has prompted criticism from conservationists who argue that the reduction was not sufficient to maintain healthy stock levels .
" this outcome confirms that the bluefin 's days are numbered and has demonstrated iccat 's inability to act on its own mandate , " said greenpeace international oceans campaigner oliver knowles .
" the word ' conservation ' should be removed from iccat 's name . " " greed and mismanagement have taken priority over sustainability and common sense , " said sergi tudela , head of the world wildlife fund 's mediterranean fisheries program .
japanese culinary favorite most of the atlantic bluefin tuna consumed in the world , 80 percent of which goes to japan , is caught by france , italy and spain from fishing operations in the mediterranean sea and eastern atlantic .
france was one of the foremost nations in pushing for the status quo to be maintained , despite a call from the eu fisheries commissioner maria damanaki for the quota to be reduced to 6,000 metric tons .
scientists say that stocks of the fish , an expensive ingredient in sushi and sashimi dishes , have fallen by more than 80 percent in the last 40 years , to about 3.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner damanaki had wanted a far more radical cut individual fish can weigh up to 650 kilograms and fetch up to 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 160,000 -rrb- at auction .
an adequate balance ?
industry representatives and national governments claimed the limits were sufficient .
french agriculture and fisheries minister bruno le maire said in a statement that the agreement represented " a balance between respecting natural resources and preserving the social-economic fabric . "
however , conservationists say they believe that current stock levels are overestimated due to illegal fishing and under-reporting of catches .
japan called for a crackdown on both of these practices , adding that strict enforcement was needed to ensure quotas were respected .

environmentalists say the fish stocks could be lower than estimated . a meeting of fishing nations on saturday agreed to leave catch quotas largely unchanged for the atlantic bluefin tuna .
the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- said that its 48 member states had set a 2011 quota of 12,900 metric tons , a reduction of 600 metric tons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the giant tuna is a highly valued ingredient in japan the slim reduction has prompted criticism from conservationists who argue that the reduction was not sufficient to maintain healthy stock levels .
" this outcome confirms that the bluefin 's days are numbered and has demonstrated iccat 's inability to act on its own mandate , " said greenpeace international oceans campaigner oliver knowles .
" the word ' conservation ' should be removed from iccat 's name . " " greed and mismanagement have taken priority over sustainability and common sense , " said sergi tudela , head of the world wildlife fund 's mediterranean fisheries program .
japanese culinary favorite most of the atlantic bluefin tuna consumed in the world , 80 percent of which goes to japan , is caught by france , italy and spain from fishing operations in the mediterranean sea and eastern atlantic .
france was one of the foremost nations in pushing for the status quo to be maintained , despite a call from the eu fisheries commissioner maria damanaki for the quota to be reduced to 6,000 metric tons .
scientists say that stocks of the fish , an expensive ingredient in sushi and sashimi dishes , have fallen by more than 80 percent in the last 40 years , to about 3.2 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner damanaki had wanted a far more radical cut individual fish can weigh up to 650 kilograms and fetch up to 120,000 euros -lrb- $ 160,000 -rrb- at auction .
an adequate balance ?
industry representatives and national governments claimed the limits were sufficient .
french agriculture and fisheries minister bruno le maire said in a statement that the agreement represented " a balance between respecting natural resources and preserving the social-economic fabric . "
however , conservationists say they believe that current stock levels are overestimated due to illegal fishing and under-reporting of catches .
japan called for a crackdown on both of these practices , adding that strict enforcement was needed to ensure quotas were respected .

licensing agreements will keep the brand alive internationally , while the family-run company builds its business at home . german brewer warsteiner has ended its direct involvement in the international market by selling its argentinan subsidiary isenbeck – founded in 1994 – to british beer giant sabmiller .
the sale marks the end of the privately held company 's push to shed its foreign operations , especially in regions subject to political volatility .
in 2008 it turned three production facilities in africa over to the french castel group .
warsteiner beer will still be available around the world through licensing agreements with other brewers .
the global market for beer is largely pinned down by large companies like , sabmiller , inbev , heineken and carlsberg .
steffan leppin , a press speaker for warsteiner , said competing for additional market share was futile for the mid-sized company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian beer isenbeck was the last of warsteiner 's foreign holdings " a mid-sized company like the warsteiner group – we 're dwarves by comparison – ca n't hold out in the long term , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we have partners who carry our brand in their portfolios , then that 's certainly an advantage . "
expansion in germany likely despite the change in strategy , international turnover via licensing remains an important component of warsteiner 's business , leppin said .
the company wants to focus on europe and north america , and is likely to buy brands within germany in the future .
" we 're a classic family-run company , " he said .
" we have a healthy core and good liquidity . "
warsteiner was founded in 1753 by antonius cramer in the north-rhein westphalian city of warstein and remains in the hands of his family .
catharina cramer , who became the group 's executive in 2006 , said in a release that the sale will " secure the presence and quality of warsteiner in argentina for the long-term . "
leppin said samples of warsteiner beer brewed overseas are flown back to germany on a weekly basis for quality control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 28.11.2010 africa 's lost elite sit on packed bags in morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a fraction of illegal migrants make it to european soil , like these men in spain refugee policies will be on the agenda at the africa-eu summit in tripoli beginning monday .
a major problem in most african countries is that well-educated people ca n't find a job and head towards europe 's borders . tens of thousands of africans every year continue to make the perilous journey across the mediterranean sea in search of work and a better life in europe .
for many illegal migrants from sub-saharan africa , though , a stopover in northern africa can turn into a sojourn lasting many years .
over the past decade , the european union has increasingly involved border countries in its battle against illegal immigration .
the bloc has tightened measures directed toward stopping migrants from entering europe but also helped with action aimed at stopping them from even leaving african territory .
morocco is a prime example of this development .
" the measures led by the european union to fight against irregular immigration have greatly contributed to the transformation of morocco from a transit country to a destination country , in this way making it a ' buffer zone ' , " said gadem , an ngo based in the moroccan capital rabat , which monitors the treatment of migrants by the country 's authorities .
active members of society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most illegal migrants hope they will make it to europe one day the number of irregular migrants in morocco is estimated between 10,000 and 20,000 people , according to figures cited by the international organization for migration .
these refugees in morocco are not the poorest of the poor , either .
they are the ones who had professions and were active members of their communities .
they are the ones who could build up development , infrastructure and efficient administrations back home - but they often failed due to cronyism and corruption .
aliyu is a typical example .
like all illegal migrants interviewed for this report , he declined to provide his full name .
the 28-year-old studied chemistry back in his native country , guinea .
but after his studies , he could n't find a job .
so he went to morocco , hoping to use it as a stepping stone to get to europe .
but that hope has not come true yet ; he 's still stuck in rabat .
he said he wished europe would use clear policies to increase pressure on african nations so that so many people would n't even have to leave their home countries .
" morocco plays the cop for europe , " aliyu said .
" but i think the eu should truly reconsider its development policies toward african countries .
what is it really about for the thousands of people from mali or guinea here ?
they 're looking for a better life and for work .
that 's why the collaboration with the countries of origin has to change . "
speaking the same language this cooperation is also one of the topics leaders from the european union and africa will address at the two-day africa-eu summit in the libyan capital beginning monday .
it is the third summit of this kind and developed out of the africa-eu joint strategy adopted by 80 african and european leaders in lisbon in december 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal migrants live in constant fear of being caught according to the european commission , the joint strategy has allowed both sides to address migration issues in a more productive manner .
" the partnership has created a forum for open exchanges in a sensitive and complex policy area , " the commission said in a statement earlier this week .
it conceded , though , that immediate results were " difficult to measure . "
" but the tone and nature of the debate has positively evolved over recent years , " the commission said .
" today , participants speak to a large extent the same language , and they increasingly share the same analysis . "
effective immigration policies merely improving the tone , though , is not enough for refugees like aliyu .
he is one of the founders of the " council of african refugees . "
though not recognized by the government , it wants to be a common forum and voice for migrants .
the organization is also campaigning for morocco to finally get effective refugee and integration policies going .
ngos like gadem report of systematic human rights abuses against migrants by moroccan security forces .
they have called on the moroccan government to view migration not only as a security problem , but also one that concerns moroccan politics , business and society as a whole .
gadem 's spokesman hicham rachidi said it does n't help anyone to confront the problem with deportation and denial - not the migrants , not europe and not morocco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachidi says morocco has to exert more effort to ensure migrants ' rights " it 's like them pouring water on sand , " rachidi said .
" it simply seeps away and leads to nothing . "
aliyu 's roommate mahamadou , who is also involved in the council , is originally from mali and has been living without papers in rabat for several years .
though he studied chemistry , he now works as an electrician , earning about seven euros -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- a day illegally .
he said structural changes in eu-african relations on this issue were necessary .
" the money that is supposed to help us develop never reaches us , " mahamadou said .
" so i wish that donors would have direct contact to those people it actually affects . "
aliyu , mahamadou and others stress that the situation in their native countries must improve .
they would like to see development aid from europe more closely tied to certain conditions and communities instead of being dependent on governments .
in 2009 , the european commission dedicated 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- - around 42 percent of its total disbursed aid - to africa .
" i wish the europeans , if they themselves do n't want any refugees , would help these people in their countries much more directly in order to further development there , " mahamadou said .
" then none of us would risk our lives in the desert or the ocean . "
willing to take risks even if there were positive developments in aid structure , the problem of illegal migration will certainly continue .
migrants want to reach european soil - be it mainland europe , the spanish enclaves of ceuta and melilla or islands in the atlantic and mediterranean - and are willing to risk people smugglers , deserts , sea crossings and the possibility of being sent home , all for the dream of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees in oujda live in makeshift camps in the nearby forests " life is all about risk , but the greatest risk is not to take a risk at all , " said 39-year-old justin .
" so you must take the risk in order to survive . "
the engineer is from the delta state in nigeria and has been stuck in oujda close to the algerian border for three years .
this is a particularly tough terrain .
it 's much more difficult to find work than in rabat , though the sub-saharan african refugees help each other out where they can .
their largest risk is being caught by the moroccan police .
in oujda , taxi drivers are forbidden from transporting sub-saharan africans .
for these migrants with dark skin , it 's better to make themselves invisible in oujda .
aliyu said there are often police raids , whether it 's in oujda or rabat .
" they search the refugees and take away their money and telephones , " he said .
" then they put them on a truck like animals and dump them again on the other side of the algerian border . "
often , they are led back into the desert , he said .
" there in the sahara , it 's really awful , " aliyu said .
" there 's no water , nothing to eat .
it 's horrible and many of our friends have lost their lives there . "
he said moroccan authorities still have n't recognized that their country has long been a place for sub-saharan africans to live and work .
it was high time for effective integration policies .

" us officials said kohl was responding to a letter from assange asking for the names of individuals who might be " at significant risk of harm " because of the document release .
kohl responded that assange 's actions would endanger the lives of " countless innocent individuals . " warning friends and allies the us was in diplomatic overdrive over the weekend to prep its international allies for the release of the documents . state department spokesman p.j. crowley said in a tweet that secretary of state hillary clinton has been in touch with leaders in germany , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , britain , france and afghanistan , while separately adding that she has spoken by telephone with chinese foreign minister yang jiechi about the potential contents of the release .
diplomats have also warned leaders in israel and canada . us ambassador to germany philip murphy told the sunday edition of the tabloid newspaper bild that it was difficult to predict what repercussions the release would have .
" at the very least it will be uncomfortable he said , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murphy says the german-us relationship is not at risk " we often speak with contacts and try to understand what 's going on in our host country and then we report home with what we 're hearing and sometimes what we think , " he told the newspaper regarding the memos to the state department from the embassies around the world . bild is reporting that the cables are particularly critical of german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who supposedly is described as being politically weak .
chancellor angela merkel also got a negative review , according to bild , although somewhat less so . murphy said , however , that he remains optimistic .
" i 'm sure that the friendship between the us and germany will survive this challenge , " he is quoted as saying . breach of confidence us ambassador to iraq james jeffrey told reporters that the release would undermine trust in the us as a diplomatic partner . " wikileaks are an absolutely awful impediment to my business , which is to be able to have discussions in confidence with people , " he said .
" they will not help ; they will simply hurt our ability to do our work here . " the italian government said it was worried about " possible negative repercussions for italy . "
foreign minister franco frattini told parliament that he had spoken with us diplomats and had been told that " the person responsible for leaking the information has been arrested . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october , wikileaks released 400,000 iraq war logs that person is believed to be bradley manning , a former army intelligence agent , although us officials have not confirmed the source of the leaks .
the technology magazine wired said that manning confessed to the leaks via web chat in may .
manning was arrested in connection with the leaks in july . wikileaks is the brainchild of australian hacker assange .

those documents included allegations of torture by iraqi forces and the possibility of an additional 15,000 civilian deaths in iraq . the documents were originally shown to the new york times , the british guardian newspaper , and german news magazine der spiegel . author : holly fox -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : ben knight / kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he met with his israeli counterpart shimon peres before traveling to the yad vashem holocaust memorial . german president christian wulff kicked off a mostly ceremonial visit to israel with talks with israeli president shimon peres .
afterwards both men commented on the importance of close bilateral ties .
" relations with germany are as important such as relations can ever be , " peres said on the second day of his three-day visit .
before heading to the yad vashem holocaust memorial for a wreath-laying ceremony , wulff said that remembrance of the holocaust remained an " unbroken maxim of german policy . "
wulff 's 17-year-old daughter and other german teenagers are accompanying him on his first trip to israel since entering office , characterized by the government as an official , but not state visit .
the involvement of the teenagers is meant to underscore germany 's commitment to passing on the memory of the holocaust to a younger generation of germans .
calls for a two-state solution wulff also expressed his support for just two-state solution to the conflict in the middle east and called on israel to constructively engage on the issue of further settlement construction , saying it was crucial to the peace process .
wulff also said his country had a " responsibility " regarding israel 's security .
" germany considers that it has a responsibility concerning israel 's right to exist and to security , " he said .
peres also called for peace through a two-state solution and thanked germany for its support .
later on sunday wulff is set to meet with israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
wulff , 51 , is germany 's first head of state to be born after world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.11.2010 iceland votes for citizen assembly to draft new constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling began on saturday morning with results expected on monday the people of iceland have voted for dozens of ordinary citizens to be tasked with the job of drafting a new constitution .
the poll comes as the country struggles to recover from its recent banking crisis . icelandic voters went at the polls on saturday to vote for an assembly of ordinary people who will shape the country 's first-ever independently drafted constitution .
up to 523 candidates are contesting a place on an assembly of between 25 and 31 people who will work on a charter to replace the one adopted when iceland became independent from denmark in 1944 .
there is no requirement that people on the assembly have university degrees .
iceland has since adhered to a customized version of denmark 's constitution with some extra clauses added and the icelandic president , rather than the danish monarch , referred to as head of state .
a spokesman for the icelandic justice ministry told the news agency afp on saturday that it expected some 50 percent of the electorate to take part in the vote .
radical alterations expected the assembly is expected to radically alter the current contract between state and citizen , considering suggestions put forward by 1,000 randomly chosen citizens aged from 18 to 89 years old .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigurdardottir hopes a new constitution will mark a new start for the country proposals include the separation of church and state as well and the public ownership of all natural resources .
there is also a call for a clear separation of the legislative branch of government from the executive .
although the decisions are not binding , the government has indicated that a well-drafted and unanimous proposal would probably be " morally binding . "
prime minister of iceland johanna sigurdardottir has said she hoped that the revised constitution would establish a new social contract that would contribute to national reconciliation .
early resistance to crisis measures sigurdardottir 's comments follow public anger against the political elite over the collapse of one of the country 's major banks , landesbanki , and the subsequent handling of the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icelandic people took to the street earlier this year iceland was one of the first countries in europe to see widespread public resistance to government measures aimed at dealing with the banking sector collapse and global financial downturn .
the icelandic capital reykjavik was the scene of demonstrations in march ahead of a public referendum on a government plan to compensate the dutch and british governments over the failure of icesave , a landesbanki subsidiary .
icelandic voters subsequently rejected the proposed compensation package .

the bailout also includes bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark . finance ministers from the 16 eurozone countries have approved a multi-billion-euro rescue package for ireland and its embattled economy .
" the final agreed program represents the best available deal for ireland , " said irish prime minister brian cowen .
" it allows us to move forward with secure funding for our essential public services , for our welfare state , for the most vulnerable members of society that depend on them .
" and it provides ireland with vital time and space to successfully and conclusively address the unprecedented problems we have been dealing with since this global economic crisis began , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers had plenty of details to hash out team effort to bridge budget gap a team of specialists from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- hammered out a deal in dublin earlier sunday for an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 112.5-billion -rrb- package of loans to bridge a massive budget deficit and cover looming bank debts in ireland .
dutch finance minister jan-kees de jager said the international monetary fund , the eurozone nations and the european commission will all be involved in the bailout , adding that it will also include bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark .

the proposal , put forth by the nationalist swiss people ’ s party , has been criticized by human rights groups . swiss voters have approved a far-right initiative to automatically expel foreign residents convicted of serious crimes , according to poll results .
swiss national broadcaster sf1 said 52.9 percent of voters backed the initiative in sunday 's referendum , a plan proposed by the nationalist swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
a counter-proposal put forth by the swiss government , which would make expulsion dependent on the length of a prison term rather on an arbitrary list of offenses , appears to have been rejected by most voters , according to preliminary results .
currently , decisions to expel foreigners convicted of serious crimes are made on a case-by-case basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters for the swiss people 's party have been controversial the initiative , which would apply to foreigners convicted of crimes like murder , rape or trafficking in drugs or people , has been criticized by human rights groups and legal experts , who said it could disregard international anti-discrimination treaties and the free movement of peoples under european union law .
switzerland , while not an eu member , does allow eu citizens to take residence without special permission .
foreigners make up more than a fifth of switzerland 's population of 7.7 million , and according to official figures are disproportionately charged with crimes .
growing support for svp the svp has become one of switzerland 's biggest political movements in recent years , garnering support by playing on the rising fear about immigration .
posters for the svp proposal showed a group of white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag , a move criticized by anti-racism groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 28.11.2010 africa 's lost elite sit on packed bags in morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a fraction of illegal migrants make it to european soil , like these men in spain refugee policies will be on the agenda at the africa-eu summit in tripoli beginning monday .
a major problem in most african countries is that well-educated people ca n't find a job and head towards europe 's borders . tens of thousands of africans every year continue to make the perilous journey across the mediterranean sea in search of work and a better life in europe .
for many illegal migrants from sub-saharan africa , though , a stopover in northern africa can turn into a sojourn lasting many years .
over the past decade , the european union has increasingly involved border countries in its battle against illegal immigration .
the bloc has tightened measures directed toward stopping migrants from entering europe but also helped with action aimed at stopping them from even leaving african territory .
morocco is a prime example of this development .
" the measures led by the european union to fight against irregular immigration have greatly contributed to the transformation of morocco from a transit country to a destination country , in this way making it a ' buffer zone ' , " said gadem , an ngo based in the moroccan capital rabat , which monitors the treatment of migrants by the country 's authorities .
active members of society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most illegal migrants hope they will make it to europe one day the number of irregular migrants in morocco is estimated between 10,000 and 20,000 people , according to figures cited by the international organization for migration .
these refugees in morocco are not the poorest of the poor , either .
they are the ones who had professions and were active members of their communities .
they are the ones who could build up development , infrastructure and efficient administrations back home - but they often failed due to cronyism and corruption .
aliyu is a typical example .
like all illegal migrants interviewed for this report , he declined to provide his full name .
the 28-year-old studied chemistry back in his native country , guinea .
but after his studies , he could n't find a job .
so he went to morocco , hoping to use it as a stepping stone to get to europe .
but that hope has not come true yet ; he 's still stuck in rabat .
he said he wished europe would use clear policies to increase pressure on african nations so that so many people would n't even have to leave their home countries .
" morocco plays the cop for europe , " aliyu said .
" but i think the eu should truly reconsider its development policies toward african countries .
what is it really about for the thousands of people from mali or guinea here ?
they 're looking for a better life and for work .
that 's why the collaboration with the countries of origin has to change . "
speaking the same language this cooperation is also one of the topics leaders from the european union and africa will address at the two-day africa-eu summit in the libyan capital beginning monday .
it is the third summit of this kind and developed out of the africa-eu joint strategy adopted by 80 african and european leaders in lisbon in december 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal migrants live in constant fear of being caught according to the european commission , the joint strategy has allowed both sides to address migration issues in a more productive manner .
" the partnership has created a forum for open exchanges in a sensitive and complex policy area , " the commission said in a statement earlier this week .
it conceded , though , that immediate results were " difficult to measure . "
" but the tone and nature of the debate has positively evolved over recent years , " the commission said .
" today , participants speak to a large extent the same language , and they increasingly share the same analysis . "
effective immigration policies merely improving the tone , though , is not enough for refugees like aliyu .
he is one of the founders of the " council of african refugees . "
though not recognized by the government , it wants to be a common forum and voice for migrants .
the organization is also campaigning for morocco to finally get effective refugee and integration policies going .
ngos like gadem report of systematic human rights abuses against migrants by moroccan security forces .
they have called on the moroccan government to view migration not only as a security problem , but also one that concerns moroccan politics , business and society as a whole .
gadem 's spokesman hicham rachidi said it does n't help anyone to confront the problem with deportation and denial - not the migrants , not europe and not morocco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachidi says morocco has to exert more effort to ensure migrants ' rights " it 's like them pouring water on sand , " rachidi said .
" it simply seeps away and leads to nothing . "
aliyu 's roommate mahamadou , who is also involved in the council , is originally from mali and has been living without papers in rabat for several years .
though he studied chemistry , he now works as an electrician , earning about seven euros -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- a day illegally .
he said structural changes in eu-african relations on this issue were necessary .
" the money that is supposed to help us develop never reaches us , " mahamadou said .
" so i wish that donors would have direct contact to those people it actually affects . "
aliyu , mahamadou and others stress that the situation in their native countries must improve .
they would like to see development aid from europe more closely tied to certain conditions and communities instead of being dependent on governments .
in 2009 , the european commission dedicated 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- - around 42 percent of its total disbursed aid - to africa .
" i wish the europeans , if they themselves do n't want any refugees , would help these people in their countries much more directly in order to further development there , " mahamadou said .
" then none of us would risk our lives in the desert or the ocean . "
willing to take risks even if there were positive developments in aid structure , the problem of illegal migration will certainly continue .
migrants want to reach european soil - be it mainland europe , the spanish enclaves of ceuta and melilla or islands in the atlantic and mediterranean - and are willing to risk people smugglers , deserts , sea crossings and the possibility of being sent home , all for the dream of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees in oujda live in makeshift camps in the nearby forests " life is all about risk , but the greatest risk is not to take a risk at all , " said 39-year-old justin .
" so you must take the risk in order to survive . "
the engineer is from the delta state in nigeria and has been stuck in oujda close to the algerian border for three years .
this is a particularly tough terrain .
it 's much more difficult to find work than in rabat , though the sub-saharan african refugees help each other out where they can .
their largest risk is being caught by the moroccan police .
in oujda , taxi drivers are forbidden from transporting sub-saharan africans .
for these migrants with dark skin , it 's better to make themselves invisible in oujda .
aliyu said there are often police raids , whether it 's in oujda or rabat .
" they search the refugees and take away their money and telephones , " he said .
" then they put them on a truck like animals and dump them again on the other side of the algerian border . "
often , they are led back into the desert , he said .
" there in the sahara , it 's really awful , " aliyu said .
" there 's no water , nothing to eat .
it 's horrible and many of our friends have lost their lives there . "
he said moroccan authorities still have n't recognized that their country has long been a place for sub-saharan africans to live and work .
it was high time for effective integration policies .

the bailout also includes bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark . finance ministers from the 16 eurozone countries have approved a multi-billion-euro rescue package for ireland and its embattled economy .
" the final agreed program represents the best available deal for ireland , " said irish prime minister brian cowen .
" it allows us to move forward with secure funding for our essential public services , for our welfare state , for the most vulnerable members of society that depend on them .
" and it provides ireland with vital time and space to successfully and conclusively address the unprecedented problems we have been dealing with since this global economic crisis began , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers had plenty of details to hash out team effort to bridge budget gap a team of specialists from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- hammered out a deal in dublin earlier sunday for an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 112.5-billion -rrb- package of loans to bridge a massive budget deficit and cover looming bank debts in ireland .
dutch finance minister jan-kees de jager said the international monetary fund , the eurozone nations and the european commission will all be involved in the bailout , adding that it will also include bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark .
" we are standing foursquare behind the euro and for stability in the eurozone , " de jager told reporters on sunday .
another eurozone rescue deal investors are worried that the troubled economies of portugal and spain could follow ireland , and german and french officials called for a rapid conclusion to the irish talks to put an end to the uncertainty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second massive bailout the bloc has had to pay this year at a meeting of finance ministers in brussels on sunday , all 27 eu nations ratified the eurozone plan to grant financial assistance . they also approved the basis of a future crisis-resolution mechanism proposed by paris and berlin . germany and france have been keen to outline details of the permanent crisis mechanism , which was outlined only broadly last month .
uncertainty about precisely how such a mechanism would work , with concern about private investors having to sustain losses , is believed to have contributed to the irish crisis . case by case liability for investors under the terms , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that private bondholders could be made to share the burden of future sovereign debt restructuring , adding that this would be decided on a case by casis - rather than an automatic - basis . decisions about whether bondholders would have to contribute would be decided in accordance with imf rules , rehn said . this irish rescue package will be the second such deal for a eurozone country this year after the eu and the imf gave greece 110 billion euros in aid in may .
as in the case of greece , the irish package hinges on an austerity plan unveiled last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen faces intense pressure to stand down over the deal that four-year plan includes 10 billion euros in spending cuts , 5 billion euros in tax hikes and the slashing of 25,000 public sector jobs .
cowen said ireland expects to pay an average interest rate of 5.8 percent a year on the loans , although this would be subject to market conditions .
he added that this was a better rate than dublin could expect on the financial markets .
protestors in dublin denounced the bailout and austerity measures on saturday , waving signs saying " eire not for sale , not to the imf " and " there is a better , fairer way . "
cowen has also faced intense pressure to quit .
his party fianna fail lost a by-election on friday , narrowing their coalition 's parliamentary majority to a precarious two seats .

" the final agreed program represents the best available deal for ireland , " said irish prime minister brian cowen .
" it allows us to move forward with secure funding for our essential public services , for our welfare state , for the most vulnerable members of society that depend on them .
" and it provides ireland with vital time and space to successfully and conclusively address the unprecedented problems we have been dealing with since this global economic crisis began , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers had plenty of details to hash out team effort to bridge budget gap a team of specialists from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- hammered out a deal in dublin earlier sunday for an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 112.5-billion -rrb- package of loans to bridge a massive budget deficit and cover looming bank debts in ireland .
dutch finance minister jan-kees de jager said the international monetary fund , the eurozone nations and the european commission will all be involved in the bailout , adding that it will also include bilateral loans from britain , sweden and denmark .
" we are standing foursquare behind the euro and for stability in the eurozone , " de jager told reporters on sunday .

uncertainty about precisely how such a mechanism would work , with concern about private investors having to sustain losses , is believed to have contributed to the irish crisis . case by case liability for investors under the terms , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that private bondholders could be made to share the burden of future sovereign debt restructuring , adding that this would be decided on a case by casis - rather than an automatic - basis . decisions about whether bondholders would have to contribute would be decided in accordance with imf rules , rehn said . this irish rescue package will be the second such deal for a eurozone country this year after the eu and the imf gave greece 110 billion euros in aid in may .
as in the case of greece , the irish package hinges on an austerity plan unveiled last week .

cowen said ireland expects to pay an average interest rate of 5.8 percent a year on the loans , although this would be subject to market conditions .
he added that this was a better rate than dublin could expect on the financial markets .
protestors in dublin denounced the bailout and austerity measures on saturday , waving signs saying " eire not for sale , not to the imf " and " there is a better , fairer way . "
cowen has also faced intense pressure to quit .
his party fianna fail lost a by-election on friday , narrowing their coalition 's parliamentary majority to a precarious two seats .
