the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .
the non-profit wikileaks , which offers a forum for anonymously posted confidential documents , has in the past been named as a threat to military operations and us security , according to britain 's daily telegraph. cmk / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .

and swiss banking secrecy laws made it virtually impossible for foreign authorities to pursue suspected tax evaders , leading to a long-festering diplomatic irritant .
germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .
it 's not clear how much money german taxpayers are currently hiding in switzerland , but experts expect the amount to be worth several billion euros .

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .

" the then archbishop had no knowledge of the decision to reassign -lrb- hullerman -rrb- to pastoral activities in a parish , " the vatican said in a statement on friday , march 26 , adding that it " rejects any other version of events as mere speculation . " the current pope greenlighted in 1980 hullerman 's transfer to the bavarian capital , after he had sexually abused an 11-year old boy in his previous parish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic churches across the world have been rocked by sex abuse scandals the priest was supposed to undergo therapy but was soon working with children again .
six years later , in 1986 , hullerman was found guilty of molesting boys in another bavarian parish . according to the new york times , the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - had received a memo about the priest 's reinstatement for pastoral work .
the munich diocese , however , denied ratzinger carried any responsibility in the case . " we stand by our account that cardinal ratzinger did n't know about this decision , " diocese spokesman bernhard kellner told the reuters news agency .
" an archbishop does n't read all the administrative acts .
he just ca n't .
that 's why he has a vicar general . " the then vicar general gerhard gruber earlier this month took full responsibility for reinstating the abusive priest . what should the pope do ? while european catholic leaders rallied behind the pope , the chairman of the austrian section of the international catholic reform movement " we are church " called on the pope to consider stepping down . " if the pope wants to be consistent in asking bishops to resign , he should ask the same from himself , " said hans peter hurka . according to hurka. the current scandals raised the question " whether someone who knew about the problems becomes an accessory if he fails to act . " like the pontiff 's native germany , austria too has been rocked by a numerous sex abuse allegations against members of catholic clergy . bildunterschrift : the pope stands accused of mishandling priest sex abuse cases papal confession the german section of " we are church " has stopped short of asking for the pontiff 's resignation , but has called for a clear confession . spokesman edgar buettner said , the " church can not simply talk its way out of this . "
he said the pope had to face his own responsibility for failing to act in those cases . earlier this week , the vatican already had to defend the pontiff for failing to act on a pedophile priest in the us when ratzinger - who was elected pope in 2005 - was a top official in the vatican . us bishops had repeatedly warned the vatican about the priest who sexually abused up to 200 deaf children between 1950 and 1974 . ai / dpa / afp / reuters / kna editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .
easing the tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are heating up for german tax evaders hiding their money across the border swiss banks have for long served as a place for europeans to park the money they wanted to hide from their national tax authorities .
and swiss banking secrecy laws made it virtually impossible for foreign authorities to pursue suspected tax evaders , leading to a long-festering diplomatic irritant .
germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .
it 's not clear how much money german taxpayers are currently hiding in switzerland , but experts expect the amount to be worth several billion euros .
the dual-tax agreement , however , will not apply to past cases , but only to ongoing and future investigations. ai / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
coalition , but not necessarily consensus but iraqiya did not win an outright majority , so it must build a coalition from among the various religious and ethnically based parties .
allawi said he would extend his " hands and heart " to all groups .
" for all who want and wish to participate in building iraq , we will together bury political sectarianism and political regionalism , " allawi told iraqi television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march 7 elections were the second in iraq since the ouster of saddam hussein in 2003 that could be easier said than done .
al-maliki has refused to accept the results of the march 7 election , after having previously called for a manual recount in light of alleged irregularities in counting the votes .
" the election results are not final , " al-maliki told a press conference in baghdad on friday .
the results must be certified by an iraqi court before they can be declared final , a process that will probably take about two weeks .
parties have three days to submit complaints to be investigated by the election commission .
allawi is also on a timeline .
he has 30 days to build a coalition including at least 163 of the parliament 's seats .
if he fails , iraq 's president will appoint the head of another party to try to form a government .
electoral success the election was judged a success by international observers , with united nations envoy ad melkert hailing them as " credible . "
the united states offered congratulations , noting that observers had not recorded any incidents of widespread fraud .
" this marks a significant milestone in the ongoing democratic development of iraq , " said state department spokesman p.j. crowley. svs / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .

serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
coalition , but not necessarily consensus but iraqiya did not win an outright majority , so it must build a coalition from among the various religious and ethnically based parties .
allawi said he would extend his " hands and heart " to all groups .
" for all who want and wish to participate in building iraq , we will together bury political sectarianism and political regionalism , " allawi told iraqi television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march 7 elections were the second in iraq since the ouster of saddam hussein in 2003 that could be easier said than done .
al-maliki has refused to accept the results of the march 7 election , after having previously called for a manual recount in light of alleged irregularities in counting the votes .
" the election results are not final , " al-maliki told a press conference in baghdad on friday .
the results must be certified by an iraqi court before they can be declared final , a process that will probably take about two weeks .
parties have three days to submit complaints to be investigated by the election commission .
allawi is also on a timeline .
he has 30 days to build a coalition including at least 163 of the parliament 's seats .
if he fails , iraq 's president will appoint the head of another party to try to form a government .
electoral success the election was judged a success by international observers , with united nations envoy ad melkert hailing them as " credible . "
the united states offered congratulations , noting that observers had not recorded any incidents of widespread fraud .

and new member states are adding more money to the development fund .
but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .

germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .
easing the tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are heating up for german tax evaders hiding their money across the border swiss banks have for long served as a place for europeans to park the money they wanted to hide from their national tax authorities .
and swiss banking secrecy laws made it virtually impossible for foreign authorities to pursue suspected tax evaders , leading to a long-festering diplomatic irritant .
germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .
it 's not clear how much money german taxpayers are currently hiding in switzerland , but experts expect the amount to be worth several billion euros .
the dual-tax agreement , however , will not apply to past cases , but only to ongoing and future investigations. ai / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .

merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .

" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .
the non-profit wikileaks , which offers a forum for anonymously posted confidential documents , has in the past been named as a threat to military operations and us security , according to britain 's daily telegraph. cmk / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition .

therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .
easing the tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are heating up for german tax evaders hiding their money across the border swiss banks have for long served as a place for europeans to park the money they wanted to hide from their national tax authorities .
and swiss banking secrecy laws made it virtually impossible for foreign authorities to pursue suspected tax evaders , leading to a long-festering diplomatic irritant .
germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .
it 's not clear how much money german taxpayers are currently hiding in switzerland , but experts expect the amount to be worth several billion euros .
the dual-tax agreement , however , will not apply to past cases , but only to ongoing and future investigations. ai / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

six years later , in 1986 , hullerman was found guilty of molesting boys in another bavarian parish . according to the new york times , the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - had received a memo about the priest 's reinstatement for pastoral work .

" if the pope wants to be consistent in asking bishops to resign , he should ask the same from himself , " said hans peter hurka . according to hurka. the current scandals raised the question " whether someone who knew about the problems becomes an accessory if he fails to act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 27.03.2010 merkel rebuffs call for turkish schools in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks living in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's idea german chancellor merkel has rejected calls by turkish prime minister erdogan to set up turkish schools in germany .
the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .
it also wants visa-free travel for its citizens to the european union. ai / afp / dpa / epd editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .

and new member states are adding more money to the development fund .
but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
coalition , but not necessarily consensus but iraqiya did not win an outright majority , so it must build a coalition from among the various religious and ethnically based parties .
allawi said he would extend his " hands and heart " to all groups .
" for all who want and wish to participate in building iraq , we will together bury political sectarianism and political regionalism , " allawi told iraqi television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march 7 elections were the second in iraq since the ouster of saddam hussein in 2003 that could be easier said than done .
al-maliki has refused to accept the results of the march 7 election , after having previously called for a manual recount in light of alleged irregularities in counting the votes .
" the election results are not final , " al-maliki told a press conference in baghdad on friday .
the results must be certified by an iraqi court before they can be declared final , a process that will probably take about two weeks .
parties have three days to submit complaints to be investigated by the election commission .
allawi is also on a timeline .
he has 30 days to build a coalition including at least 163 of the parliament 's seats .
if he fails , iraq 's president will appoint the head of another party to try to form a government .
electoral success the election was judged a success by international observers , with united nations envoy ad melkert hailing them as " credible . "
the united states offered congratulations , noting that observers had not recorded any incidents of widespread fraud .
" this marks a significant milestone in the ongoing democratic development of iraq , " said state department spokesman p.j. crowley. svs / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .
easing the tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are heating up for german tax evaders hiding their money across the border swiss banks have for long served as a place for europeans to park the money they wanted to hide from their national tax authorities .
and swiss banking secrecy laws made it virtually impossible for foreign authorities to pursue suspected tax evaders , leading to a long-festering diplomatic irritant .
germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .
it 's not clear how much money german taxpayers are currently hiding in switzerland , but experts expect the amount to be worth several billion euros .
the dual-tax agreement , however , will not apply to past cases , but only to ongoing and future investigations. ai / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .
it also wants visa-free travel for its citizens to the european union. ai / afp / dpa / epd editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 27.03.2010 germany and switzerland reach agreement on tax-cheat data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland will have to share more of its banking secrets in the future stepping up their crackdown on tax evaders , berlin and bern have reached a preliminary deal on a dual-tax agreement .
the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .
easing the tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are heating up for german tax evaders hiding their money across the border swiss banks have for long served as a place for europeans to park the money they wanted to hide from their national tax authorities .
and swiss banking secrecy laws made it virtually impossible for foreign authorities to pursue suspected tax evaders , leading to a long-festering diplomatic irritant .
germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .
easing the tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are heating up for german tax evaders hiding their money across the border swiss banks have for long served as a place for europeans to park the money they wanted to hide from their national tax authorities .

germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 27.03.2010 merkel rebuffs call for turkish schools in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks living in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's idea german chancellor merkel has rejected calls by turkish prime minister erdogan to set up turkish schools in germany .
the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .
it also wants visa-free travel for its citizens to the european union. ai / afp / dpa / epd editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and new member states are adding more money to the development fund .
but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

and new member states are adding more money to the development fund .
but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .
it also wants visa-free travel for its citizens to the european union. ai / afp / dpa / epd editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
coalition , but not necessarily consensus but iraqiya did not win an outright majority , so it must build a coalition from among the various religious and ethnically based parties .
allawi said he would extend his " hands and heart " to all groups .
" for all who want and wish to participate in building iraq , we will together bury political sectarianism and political regionalism , " allawi told iraqi television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march 7 elections were the second in iraq since the ouster of saddam hussein in 2003 that could be easier said than done .
al-maliki has refused to accept the results of the march 7 election , after having previously called for a manual recount in light of alleged irregularities in counting the votes .
" the election results are not final , " al-maliki told a press conference in baghdad on friday .
the results must be certified by an iraqi court before they can be declared final , a process that will probably take about two weeks .
parties have three days to submit complaints to be investigated by the election commission .
allawi is also on a timeline .
he has 30 days to build a coalition including at least 163 of the parliament 's seats .
if he fails , iraq 's president will appoint the head of another party to try to form a government .
electoral success the election was judged a success by international observers , with united nations envoy ad melkert hailing them as " credible . "
the united states offered congratulations , noting that observers had not recorded any incidents of widespread fraud .

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .
it also wants visa-free travel for its citizens to the european union. ai / afp / dpa / epd editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .
easing the tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are heating up for german tax evaders hiding their money across the border swiss banks have for long served as a place for europeans to park the money they wanted to hide from their national tax authorities .
and swiss banking secrecy laws made it virtually impossible for foreign authorities to pursue suspected tax evaders , leading to a long-festering diplomatic irritant .
germany 's schaeuble , however , was eager on friday to downplay the strained relations over the issue .
" it 's a visit among friends , " he said after the meeting , adding that germany had great respect for swiss constitutional history .
yet germany over the last years has been one of the harshest critics of switzerland 's strict banking secrecy laws .
berlin has on more than one occasion purchased account information stolen from swiss banks to crack down on tax fraudsters - a move that has lead to serious fallouts between the two countries .
it 's not clear how much money german taxpayers are currently hiding in switzerland , but experts expect the amount to be worth several billion euros .
the dual-tax agreement , however , will not apply to past cases , but only to ongoing and future investigations. ai / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and new member states are adding more money to the development fund .
but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .

and new member states are adding more money to the development fund .
but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .

therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .

" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .
it also wants visa-free travel for its citizens to the european union. ai / afp / dpa / epd editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .

the move comes after a prolonged period of tension between the two nations over banking secrecy . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz on friday worked out the first draft of a new dual-tax agreement between their two countries , but agreed not to disclose details pending final approval by governments in bern and berlin .
according to the ministries , however , the outline closely follows along the lines suggested by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
each country should be entitled to inquiries in individual cases only if there 's suspected tax evasion , but there will be no automatic exchange of tax data .
germany hopes that such an agreement will help to prevent tax evasion while switzerland aims to comply with oecd standards .
last year , bern was on the brink of being blacklisted as a tax haven by the oecd for its failure to ease its banking secrecy .
merz dismissed the idea that switzerland was a tax haven but admitted there were " certain assets that are not registered . "
in return for cooperation on tax evasion , he said , switzerland expected to get easier access for its banks to the german market .

" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .
it also wants visa-free travel for its citizens to the european union. ai / afp / dpa / epd editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.03.2010 report says afghan women can help sell war to europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations are reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan a leaked cia document suggests recruiting afghan women to help drum up support for the war in afghanistan .
the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
coalition , but not necessarily consensus but iraqiya did not win an outright majority , so it must build a coalition from among the various religious and ethnically based parties .
allawi said he would extend his " hands and heart " to all groups .
" for all who want and wish to participate in building iraq , we will together bury political sectarianism and political regionalism , " allawi told iraqi television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march 7 elections were the second in iraq since the ouster of saddam hussein in 2003 that could be easier said than done .
al-maliki has refused to accept the results of the march 7 election , after having previously called for a manual recount in light of alleged irregularities in counting the votes .
" the election results are not final , " al-maliki told a press conference in baghdad on friday .
the results must be certified by an iraqi court before they can be declared final , a process that will probably take about two weeks .
parties have three days to submit complaints to be investigated by the election commission .
allawi is also on a timeline .
he has 30 days to build a coalition including at least 163 of the parliament 's seats .
if he fails , iraq 's president will appoint the head of another party to try to form a government .
electoral success the election was judged a success by international observers , with united nations envoy ad melkert hailing them as " credible . "
the united states offered congratulations , noting that observers had not recorded any incidents of widespread fraud .
" this marks a significant milestone in the ongoing democratic development of iraq , " said state department spokesman p.j. crowley. svs / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .

the proposal has also been criticized by politicians and turkish groups in germany . " this will not get us ahead , " merkel said in her weekly video blog on saturday .
" we want people who have over many generations lived in germany to integrate .
and that means that of course they have to learn the german language and live by german laws . "
integration , she said , should not be confused with " assimilation or giving up your country of origin . "
in an interview with german weekly die zeit on thursday , erdogan called for turkish schools to be established in germany .
the turkish premier said many of the 2.7 million people of turkish origin in germany had problems learning german .
" we have german schools in turkey - why then ca n't we have turkish schools in germany ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say erdogan might be using nationalist rhetoric with a keen eye on voters in turkey the controversy comes as angela merkel prepares for a two-day visit to turkey .
the countries ' relations are already strained over germany 's opposition to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's party instead favors what it calls a " privileged partnership " between brussels and ankara .
no support from turkish community politicians , teachers and representatives of the country 's large turkish community in germany have also dismissed erdogan 's proposal , saying it would hinder integration rather than help it .
" if what he -lrb- erdogan -rrb- suggests is to have schools where all classes will be taught in turkish , then we think this would be a grave mistake , " kenan kolat , the head of germany 's turkish community told newspaper die welt .
" if we want highly qualified migrants in germany , then they have to attend german schools . "
german politicians of turkish origin have also shot down the proposal .
serkan toeren , a member of parliament for the liberal free democrats , said that children growing up in turkish families should instead learn german as early as possible .
aydan oezoguz of the green party said that while the call for turkish elite schools might be justified , one should not expect that they will help in any way to solve problems of integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party is opposed to full eu membership for turkey the head of the german teachers ' association , josef krauss , told the rheinische post daily that erdogan 's suggestion was " inacceptable and counter productive when it comes to helping young turks in germany trying to integrate . "
cool ties germany has the highest population of turks outside turkey but relations between berlin and ankara have been rocky in the past .
germany - together with france - is the leading opponent to turkish eu membership .
merkel 's trip to ankara is not expected to bring a thaw in relations .
aside from turkey 's eu bid , the talks are expected to focus on possible sanctions against iran over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
trade relations are also on the agenda .
germany is turkey 's main trading partner but ankara has been calling for a reassessment of its customs union with the eu .

" the then archbishop had no knowledge of the decision to reassign -lrb- hullerman -rrb- to pastoral activities in a parish , " the vatican said in a statement on friday , march 26 , adding that it " rejects any other version of events as mere speculation . " the current pope greenlighted in 1980 hullerman 's transfer to the bavarian capital , after he had sexually abused an 11-year old boy in his previous parish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic churches across the world have been rocked by sex abuse scandals the priest was supposed to undergo therapy but was soon working with children again .
six years later , in 1986 , hullerman was found guilty of molesting boys in another bavarian parish . according to the new york times , the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - had received a memo about the priest 's reinstatement for pastoral work .
the munich diocese , however , denied ratzinger carried any responsibility in the case . " we stand by our account that cardinal ratzinger did n't know about this decision , " diocese spokesman bernhard kellner told the reuters news agency .
" an archbishop does n't read all the administrative acts .
he just ca n't .
that 's why he has a vicar general . " the then vicar general gerhard gruber earlier this month took full responsibility for reinstating the abusive priest . what should the pope do ? while european catholic leaders rallied behind the pope , the chairman of the austrian section of the international catholic reform movement " we are church " called on the pope to consider stepping down . " if the pope wants to be consistent in asking bishops to resign , he should ask the same from himself , " said hans peter hurka . according to hurka. the current scandals raised the question " whether someone who knew about the problems becomes an accessory if he fails to act . " like the pontiff 's native germany , austria too has been rocked by a numerous sex abuse allegations against members of catholic clergy . bildunterschrift : the pope stands accused of mishandling priest sex abuse cases papal confession the german section of " we are church " has stopped short of asking for the pontiff 's resignation , but has called for a clear confession . spokesman edgar buettner said , the " church can not simply talk its way out of this . "
he said the pope had to face his own responsibility for failing to act in those cases . earlier this week , the vatican already had to defend the pontiff for failing to act on a pedophile priest in the us when ratzinger - who was elected pope in 2005 - was a top official in the vatican . us bishops had repeatedly warned the vatican about the priest who sexually abused up to 200 deaf children between 1950 and 1974 . ai / dpa / afp / reuters / kna editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and new member states are adding more money to the development fund .
but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders at the european development days in brussels ilona petrikiene , the commission 's aid effectiveness international coordination officer , told deutsche welle that the arrival of the eu 12 -lrb- the newer member states -rrb- has had an impact on european development policy because most of these members are former aid beneficiaries themselves .
therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .
the non-profit wikileaks , which offers a forum for anonymously posted confidential documents , has in the past been named as a threat to military operations and us security , according to britain 's daily telegraph. cmk / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
coalition , but not necessarily consensus but iraqiya did not win an outright majority , so it must build a coalition from among the various religious and ethnically based parties .
allawi said he would extend his " hands and heart " to all groups .
" for all who want and wish to participate in building iraq , we will together bury political sectarianism and political regionalism , " allawi told iraqi television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march 7 elections were the second in iraq since the ouster of saddam hussein in 2003 that could be easier said than done .
al-maliki has refused to accept the results of the march 7 election , after having previously called for a manual recount in light of alleged irregularities in counting the votes .
" the election results are not final , " al-maliki told a press conference in baghdad on friday .
the results must be certified by an iraqi court before they can be declared final , a process that will probably take about two weeks .
parties have three days to submit complaints to be investigated by the election commission .
allawi is also on a timeline .
he has 30 days to build a coalition including at least 163 of the parliament 's seats .
if he fails , iraq 's president will appoint the head of another party to try to form a government .
electoral success the election was judged a success by international observers , with united nations envoy ad melkert hailing them as " credible . "
the united states offered congratulations , noting that observers had not recorded any incidents of widespread fraud .

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
coalition , but not necessarily consensus but iraqiya did not win an outright majority , so it must build a coalition from among the various religious and ethnically based parties .
allawi said he would extend his " hands and heart " to all groups .
" for all who want and wish to participate in building iraq , we will together bury political sectarianism and political regionalism , " allawi told iraqi television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march 7 elections were the second in iraq since the ouster of saddam hussein in 2003 that could be easier said than done .
al-maliki has refused to accept the results of the march 7 election , after having previously called for a manual recount in light of alleged irregularities in counting the votes .
" the election results are not final , " al-maliki told a press conference in baghdad on friday .
the results must be certified by an iraqi court before they can be declared final , a process that will probably take about two weeks .
parties have three days to submit complaints to be investigated by the election commission .
allawi is also on a timeline .
he has 30 days to build a coalition including at least 163 of the parliament 's seats .
if he fails , iraq 's president will appoint the head of another party to try to form a government .
electoral success the election was judged a success by international observers , with united nations envoy ad melkert hailing them as " credible . "
the united states offered congratulations , noting that observers had not recorded any incidents of widespread fraud .
" this marks a significant milestone in the ongoing democratic development of iraq , " said state department spokesman p.j. crowley. svs / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the intelligence agency is concerned about waning enthusiasm for the nato effort , especially in europe . in an effort to convince skeptical europeans to support the nato-led war effort in afghanistan , the cia is calling for the recruitment of afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked friday .
" afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for european audiences , according to a cia report posted on whistleblower web site wikileaks .
the report , dated march 11 , suggested that the views of afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the afghan war in europe , particularly in countries like germany and france where support is waning .
the report cites the recent fall of the dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of european support .
" the tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in french or german casualties or in afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
germany and france maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in afghanistan .
a focus on germany among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" for example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in afghanistan could heighten germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
the central intelligence agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .
the non-profit wikileaks , which offers a forum for anonymously posted confidential documents , has in the past been named as a threat to military operations and us security , according to britain 's daily telegraph. cmk / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can their own experiences with transition contribute to aid effectiveness ? in spite of the staggering amount of aid -lrb- billions annually -rrb- , it still remains difficult to quantify the european union 's success in africa .
one thing is certain ; the eu is yet to optimize its ability to contribute to development and the eradication of poverty on the continent .
as a result , measures have been introduced to develop a coherent policy for development and avoid contradiction and competition in the aid sector . in 2008 , during the czech presidency , the eu commission began to compile a european transition compendium -lrb- etc -rrb- - a document that " will collect examples of best practice for the newer member states that would be useful for emerging and developing countries in transition . "
newer members can help with governance and transition experts feel that the experience of newer eu members with transition , governance , and accession to the eu has provided them with an experience that would be essential to understanding the problems of countries in a similar situation .

therefore , they are more likely to have a better understanding of countries undergoing transition and development issues .
istvan gyamarti , president of the international center for democratic transition in hungary agrees .
he told deutsche welle that some cases have shown that recommendations from countries that have recently undergone transition and do not share a complex history with africa may be " more welcome . "
so even though the newer eu members contribute less than 2 percent toward the european development fund , experts are hoping to use their experiences with governance and transition to improve aid effectiveness in developing countries .
slovenia and lithuania work on their ties with africa but the newer eu members face some challenges .
unlike their larger neighbors , most do not have substantial ties to countries in africa .
in fact , a lot of them do not even have diplomatic representations on the continent .
this is a problem because they can not establish the bilateral relations that are needed to plan and implement projects in a country ; and they are unable to support their citizen volunteers and ngos that are involved in development work .
but different strategies are being adopted to resolve this problem .
as part of its efforts to establish better ties with africa , slovenia now has an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , says matej kramberger of slovenia 's ministry of foreign affairs department for international development corporation .
and the country hopes to have development projects in cape verde by next year .
by having an ambassador for cape verde in brussels , slovenia will be able to save on administrative costs while establishing and maintaining diplomatic relations with the archipelago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia intends to implement development projects in cape verde lithuania is also trying to implement a cost-effective solution .
" because lithuania has no plans to open embassies in africa due to financial constraints , it is planning to send people to other countries ' embassies , " tomas irnius , head of the policy and planning division of the lithuanian development corporation , told deutsche welle .
the baltic country has been working with northern countries that have embassies and more substantial ties to africa to host its development experts , so that it can implement and plan projects , and support lithuanian ngos and volunteers .
european transition compendium to add to aid effectiveness lithuania aims to get the eu involved in establishing relationships with larger member states which would then host its citizens , who would then have the opportunity to learn more about africa and share their experiences with transition and governance .
the release of the european transition compendium later this year will help determine the areas in which the newer eu countries can contribute to development . experts are hoping that the document will " be more about practice because new eu members have a special experience with transition and accession and how it affected development , " said istvan gyamart .

now allawi must focus on finding coalition partners . the secular iraqiya party of former prime minister ayad allawi has begun coalition-building after preliminary election results indicated it had won two more seats than that of incumbent prime minister nuri al-maliki .
but talks could prove divisive .
iraqiya won a total of 91 seats in the 325-seat parliament , edging out maliki 's state of law alliance , which won 89 seats according to preliminary results of 100 percent of the votes , issued by iraq 's election commission on friday .
the shiite-led iraqi national alliance won 70 seats , and the kurdistania party of iraq 's autonomous kurdish region won 43 seats .
