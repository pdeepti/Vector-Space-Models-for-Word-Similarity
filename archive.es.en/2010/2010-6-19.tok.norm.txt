the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

new report reveals shocking state of german education system ha !
you think things are bad in germany ?
go to the us and see what lack of education really looks like .
the world 's richest country should be the one with the best of everything , including standards of living and education , to name just two items - but sad to say , it is not ! - hal , us the problem experienced with the german school system is very simple .
german society focuses on the slow but steady development and process of individuals along traditional skills and contributions to society .
this is reflected in how children progress in development and schooling .
problems arise when you suddenly have a large number of non-germans to integrate along with their children who may or may not have been born in germany .
multicultural societies are dysfunctional .
all multicultural societies create is the permanent separation of visible immigrants or newcomers from the greater society .
the best approach is integration .
it may take one or two generations to achieve but it is the most natural , honest and wisest approach . - gerhard , canada hecs -lrb- higher education contribution scheme -rrb- fees for university students are outrageous in australia and suck the income of those graduates beginning careers after university .
most full-time university students live on the poverty line or below .
tafe -lrb- technical and further education -rrb- students do not fare much better with the fee structure for their courses , especially at diploma or higher level .
full time tafe students suffer similarly to university students with income .
many university and tafe students , when they are young people , rely on family for help whether it is accommodation or financial support .
the federal and state governments in australia could do more to help these people with their life while studying . - stuart , australia i thought you were discussing canada on your website in education .
the future belongs to countries that can work together . - malcolm , canada i attended school in germany up to the 10th grade .
i was enrolled in realschule and would have finished school that year if i had stayed in germany .
after moving to canada i continued to the 12th grade and then received a university degree .
i would not have been able to achieve that had i stayed in germany .
fourth grade is much too early to decide if a student has what it takes to attend university .
they should all be encouraged to do their best .
i 'm not saying our system in canada is great , but at least we are all given the chance to prove ourselves . - silvia , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.06.2010 estonia is ' most integrated country north of germany ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilves says estonains are " committed " to afghanistan skeptics have said greece 's debt crisis should have made estonia rethink adopting the euro , but estonian president toomas hendrik ilves says it was a natural step in the country 's european integration . at a european union summit on thursday , eu leaders voted to make estonia the latest country to adopt the euro .
the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.06.2010 referees in the spotlight after a day of questionable decisions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was n't the same after going down to ten men fans of germany and the united states feel bad refereeing cost their teams points on friday in the world cup .
dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .

not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coulibaly can smile and smile and still be a villain this goes for mali 's koman coulibaly as well .
the financial auditor from bamako is , by african standards , a vastly experienced referee .
he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .
but that is still not enough .
lacking the day-in-day-out challenge of calling games and feeling the consequent pressure at the highest level - and by that i mean europe or the top leagues in the americas -lrb- brazil , argentina , mexico -rrb- - the likes of coulibaly are simply not to be trusted at the world cup .
that they often fail is not their fault - it 's the biggest game they 've ever called , and they are overwhelmed by the situation .
fifa appoints these referees before they are ready for prime time out of a high-minded impulse .
it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .
moreover , fifa takes just one referee from each country , and thus countries like germany or france - both of which could probably offer 15 or more referees of a very high standard - send one , so as to make way for minnows .
development aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang stark is the only german ref at the world cup the best way to ensure a decent standard of refereeing across the board is a radical re-think - to begin viewing the grooming of refereeing talent much in the way players are brought along .
if you look at the rosters of most african or smaller latin american countries at the world cup , you will find relatively few players who are plying their trade at home .
check out those sides ' starting line-ups from the first two games , and you will see still fewer .
players know that if they wish to improve , they must go to the big leagues - referees must do the same .
it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .
but perhaps we should start asking them to .
maybe a referee from an outlier country should have to apprentice in a top league for at least a year , or call some minimum number of games there , before he is eligible for the world cup .
at the very least there needs to be a radical expansion of existing referee exchange programs that bring officials from football 's smaller federations to the big leagues to shadow referees .
and those bangladeshi and namibian referees need to be put into league games too , once they 're ready .
it could be a tough pill to swallow for fans of the english premier league or the bundesliga , to look in their match program to see " referee : coffi codjia -lrb- benin -rrb- " on a saturday afternoon .
but it would certainly help the world game , and might just keep their national side from getting shafted at the next world cup .

dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .

dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coulibaly can smile and smile and still be a villain this goes for mali 's koman coulibaly as well .
the financial auditor from bamako is , by african standards , a vastly experienced referee .
he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .
but that is still not enough .
lacking the day-in-day-out challenge of calling games and feeling the consequent pressure at the highest level - and by that i mean europe or the top leagues in the americas -lrb- brazil , argentina , mexico -rrb- - the likes of coulibaly are simply not to be trusted at the world cup .
that they often fail is not their fault - it 's the biggest game they 've ever called , and they are overwhelmed by the situation .
fifa appoints these referees before they are ready for prime time out of a high-minded impulse .
it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .
moreover , fifa takes just one referee from each country , and thus countries like germany or france - both of which could probably offer 15 or more referees of a very high standard - send one , so as to make way for minnows .
development aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang stark is the only german ref at the world cup the best way to ensure a decent standard of refereeing across the board is a radical re-think - to begin viewing the grooming of refereeing talent much in the way players are brought along .
if you look at the rosters of most african or smaller latin american countries at the world cup , you will find relatively few players who are plying their trade at home .
check out those sides ' starting line-ups from the first two games , and you will see still fewer .
players know that if they wish to improve , they must go to the big leagues - referees must do the same .
it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .
but perhaps we should start asking them to .
maybe a referee from an outlier country should have to apprentice in a top league for at least a year , or call some minimum number of games there , before he is eligible for the world cup .
at the very least there needs to be a radical expansion of existing referee exchange programs that bring officials from football 's smaller federations to the big leagues to shadow referees .
and those bangladeshi and namibian referees need to be put into league games too , once they 're ready .
it could be a tough pill to swallow for fans of the english premier league or the bundesliga , to look in their match program to see " referee : coffi codjia -lrb- benin -rrb- " on a saturday afternoon .
but it would certainly help the world game , and might just keep their national side from getting shafted at the next world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.06.2010 referees in the spotlight after a day of questionable decisions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was n't the same after going down to ten men fans of germany and the united states feel bad refereeing cost their teams points on friday in the world cup .
dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coulibaly can smile and smile and still be a villain this goes for mali 's koman coulibaly as well .
the financial auditor from bamako is , by african standards , a vastly experienced referee .
he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .
but that is still not enough .
lacking the day-in-day-out challenge of calling games and feeling the consequent pressure at the highest level - and by that i mean europe or the top leagues in the americas -lrb- brazil , argentina , mexico -rrb- - the likes of coulibaly are simply not to be trusted at the world cup .
that they often fail is not their fault - it 's the biggest game they 've ever called , and they are overwhelmed by the situation .
fifa appoints these referees before they are ready for prime time out of a high-minded impulse .
it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .
moreover , fifa takes just one referee from each country , and thus countries like germany or france - both of which could probably offer 15 or more referees of a very high standard - send one , so as to make way for minnows .

the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

new report reveals shocking state of german education system ha !
you think things are bad in germany ?
go to the us and see what lack of education really looks like .
the world 's richest country should be the one with the best of everything , including standards of living and education , to name just two items - but sad to say , it is not ! - hal , us the problem experienced with the german school system is very simple .
german society focuses on the slow but steady development and process of individuals along traditional skills and contributions to society .
this is reflected in how children progress in development and schooling .
problems arise when you suddenly have a large number of non-germans to integrate along with their children who may or may not have been born in germany .
multicultural societies are dysfunctional .
all multicultural societies create is the permanent separation of visible immigrants or newcomers from the greater society .
the best approach is integration .
it may take one or two generations to achieve but it is the most natural , honest and wisest approach . - gerhard , canada hecs -lrb- higher education contribution scheme -rrb- fees for university students are outrageous in australia and suck the income of those graduates beginning careers after university .
most full-time university students live on the poverty line or below .
tafe -lrb- technical and further education -rrb- students do not fare much better with the fee structure for their courses , especially at diploma or higher level .
full time tafe students suffer similarly to university students with income .
many university and tafe students , when they are young people , rely on family for help whether it is accommodation or financial support .
the federal and state governments in australia could do more to help these people with their life while studying . - stuart , australia i thought you were discussing canada on your website in education .
the future belongs to countries that can work together . - malcolm , canada i attended school in germany up to the 10th grade .
i was enrolled in realschule and would have finished school that year if i had stayed in germany .
after moving to canada i continued to the 12th grade and then received a university degree .
i would not have been able to achieve that had i stayed in germany .
fourth grade is much too early to decide if a student has what it takes to attend university .
they should all be encouraged to do their best .
i 'm not saying our system in canada is great , but at least we are all given the chance to prove ourselves . - silvia , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.06.2010 referees in the spotlight after a day of questionable decisions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was n't the same after going down to ten men fans of germany and the united states feel bad refereeing cost their teams points on friday in the world cup .
dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coulibaly can smile and smile and still be a villain this goes for mali 's koman coulibaly as well .
the financial auditor from bamako is , by african standards , a vastly experienced referee .
he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .
but that is still not enough .
lacking the day-in-day-out challenge of calling games and feeling the consequent pressure at the highest level - and by that i mean europe or the top leagues in the americas -lrb- brazil , argentina , mexico -rrb- - the likes of coulibaly are simply not to be trusted at the world cup .
that they often fail is not their fault - it 's the biggest game they 've ever called , and they are overwhelmed by the situation .
fifa appoints these referees before they are ready for prime time out of a high-minded impulse .
it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .
moreover , fifa takes just one referee from each country , and thus countries like germany or france - both of which could probably offer 15 or more referees of a very high standard - send one , so as to make way for minnows .
development aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang stark is the only german ref at the world cup the best way to ensure a decent standard of refereeing across the board is a radical re-think - to begin viewing the grooming of refereeing talent much in the way players are brought along .
if you look at the rosters of most african or smaller latin american countries at the world cup , you will find relatively few players who are plying their trade at home .
check out those sides ' starting line-ups from the first two games , and you will see still fewer .
players know that if they wish to improve , they must go to the big leagues - referees must do the same .
it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .
but perhaps we should start asking them to .
maybe a referee from an outlier country should have to apprentice in a top league for at least a year , or call some minimum number of games there , before he is eligible for the world cup .
at the very least there needs to be a radical expansion of existing referee exchange programs that bring officials from football 's smaller federations to the big leagues to shadow referees .
and those bangladeshi and namibian referees need to be put into league games too , once they 're ready .
it could be a tough pill to swallow for fans of the english premier league or the bundesliga , to look in their match program to see " referee : coffi codjia -lrb- benin -rrb- " on a saturday afternoon .
but it would certainly help the world game , and might just keep their national side from getting shafted at the next world cup .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .

but things may change as demand for new cars picks up . one in five german automotive suppliers still faces possible insolvency following one of the biggest crises in the global car manufacturing market , according to a new report published by d & b deutschland .
that 's slightly better than the one-in-three assessment made by a.t. kearny a year earlier .
but industry experts are n't celebrating just yet .
" i do n't see any sustainable stabilization , " michael seifert , author of the report , told deutsche welle .
" suppliers are benefitting from the upswing in some markets but it is not clear whether it 's enough for all of them to survive . "
core business germany is home to more than 5,300 companies supplying components not only to the country 's big carmakers , such as bmw , daimler and volkswagen , but also to manufacturers worldwide .
more than half of these make automotive parts as their core business .
altogether , the suppliers employ more than 300,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch is a tier one automotive supplier with global operations the situation in germany 's auto components sector is complex and complicated , according to seifert .
the expert cites as an example last year 's cash-for-clunkers program to promote new car sales .
" the program helped boost sales but is now winding down for suppliers as they work through the contracts , " he said .
and with no new incentive program in the pipeline , it 's unclear what could stimulate demand in a weak economy .
automotive suppliers in germany , especially the some 2,500 companies that manufacture components as their core business , are pretty much at the mercy of carmakers .
christoph stuermer , an automotive analyst with his global insight , likens the situation to a train .
" when the locomotive accelerates , the back of the train needs to push , " he said .
" when the loc slams on the brakes , the wheels of the caboose are smoking . "
following in carmakers ' footsteps auto component makers in germany face a number of challenges .
for one , german carmakers are expanding in the growth markets china , india and latin america , far away from many of their traditional suppliers and close to new , low-cost competitors .
but stuermer believes automotive suppliers in germany are well positioned to meet these and other challenges .
the tier one suppliers , he said , already operate globally and will follow in the footsteps of their customers and there will still be plenty of demand domestically to sustain growth in traditional markets .
but stuermer is quick to admit that competition among automotive suppliers is as fierce as it comes and will fuel consolidation , forcing some players out of the market .
" moving ahead , suppliers in germany will have to differentiate themselves even more than they have in the past , " he said .
" and they can do that by manufacturing still more efficiently through intelligent systems and by placing an even greater emphasis on innovation , where they have plenty of strengths . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.06.2010 close election expected as polls open in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts predict the vote will be close polls have opened in the presidential election in poland , which was triggered by the death of president lech kaczynski .
the campaign mood was sedate , even with topics like euro adoption and afghanistan up for debate . polls opened on sunday in poland 's presidential election , in a vote which many analysts are already anticipating will end inconclusively , leading to a second round of voting in two weeks .
but a recent opinion poll suggests center-right candidate and acting president bronislaw komorowski could scrape by with 51 percent of the vote , the minimum needed to avoid a run-off against right-wing candidate jaroslaw kaczynski .
the elections are being held early in poland this year after former president lech kaczynski was killed along with 95 others in a plane crash in russia on april 10 .
he was the twin brother of jaroslaw kaczynski , who has vowed to pick up where his brother left off .
as speaker of the parliament , komorowski became acting president after kaczynski 's death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's death thrust the nation into a state of mourning in poland , the president is not just a ceremonial figure .
he may hold less power than the prime minister but can still veto laws .
the country 's next president could play a role in the debate over adopting the euro and when to withdraw the country 's troops from nato 's mission in afghanistan .
komorowski has promised to withdraw polish troops from afghanistan , should he be elected .
he said the death of a polish soldier last weekend was " a signal to polish public opinion that something is not right with this mission . "
divided on the issues both komorowski and kaczynski are conservative catholics , but take a dramatically different approach to the euro and poland 's foreign relationships .
kaczynski , who was prime minster from 2006 to 2007 , could put the breaks on parliament as it takes steps toward the adoption of the euro .
" a win for jaroslaw kaczynski would be political hell , " prime minister donald tusk , of komorowski 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- , said recently .
kaczynski is known for his nationalistic stance , putting up a frosty front both to the european union and to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if komorowski wins , the po will control the office of the prime minister and president poland was the only one of the 27 eu countries that did not experience a recession last year .
but the global downturn has led to a budget deficit of 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the deceased kaczynski had often blocked efforts by the pro-business po party from enacting market reforms and his candidate brother opposes government privatization plans .
so far the po has failed to deliver on promises of raising the retirement age and bringing an end to pension privileges enjoyed by farmers and other groups .
party politicians have so far cited the risk of a presidential veto as a reason not to pursue those issues .
kaczynski 's right-wing law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- is nationalistic , euroskeptic and conservative on moral and social issues but swings left on the economy and favors more state spending .
a changed tone the death of lech kaczynski cast a shadow on the election , compounded by two consecutive waves of flooding that left 24 people dead in recent weeks .
" the politicians are using different words ; the campaigns are not as aggressive as they normally are in poland , " said joachim ciecierski , head of polish public radio 's german service .
" the atmosphere is calm , although you can sense a certain tension in the air because it is an important election . "
there 's also been a shift in the electorate .

but the global downturn has led to a budget deficit of 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the deceased kaczynski had often blocked efforts by the pro-business po party from enacting market reforms and his candidate brother opposes government privatization plans .
so far the po has failed to deliver on promises of raising the retirement age and bringing an end to pension privileges enjoyed by farmers and other groups .
party politicians have so far cited the risk of a presidential veto as a reason not to pursue those issues .
kaczynski 's right-wing law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- is nationalistic , euroskeptic and conservative on moral and social issues but swings left on the economy and favors more state spending .
a changed tone the death of lech kaczynski cast a shadow on the election , compounded by two consecutive waves of flooding that left 24 people dead in recent weeks .
" the politicians are using different words ; the campaigns are not as aggressive as they normally are in poland , " said joachim ciecierski , head of polish public radio 's german service .
" the atmosphere is calm , although you can sense a certain tension in the air because it is an important election . "
there 's also been a shift in the electorate .
before the plane crash , komorowski was seen as a shoo-in for the presidency .
but the death of their president has turned voters to the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has reached out to centrist voters in his campaign " somehow -lsb- komorowski -rsb- had taken this almost for granted , " andrzej krajewski of the civic development forum think tank , told deutsche welle .
" in opinion polls he was far ahead of his contenders , including president kaczynski , and now he 's in a very difficult position .
as acting president he will have to execute presidential power , which includes a lot of nominations and a lot of moves which will be measured against his presidency . "
kaczynski was known for his acerbic remarks but has toned down his rhetoric in this campaign in a bid to woo centrist voters .
" for now , jaroslaw is not obliging -lsb- po -rsb- and is playing the kindly old duffer who wants to use this national tragedy to overcome old animosities and unite the nation , " wrote preston keat of eurasia group , a political risk consultancy , in an analytical note this week .

leaders of the 20 biggest developed and developing economies meet on june 26-27 in toronto , canada .
in her weekly podcast , merkel said from a european perspective , keeping an eye on avoiding future economic problems takes priority .
" for the european parties involved , and especially germany , it is urgently necessary to prevent crises like this from ever happening again in the future , " she said .
economic growth must be sustainable , environmentally friendly and oriented towards the future , merkel said .
eu nations on austerity drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes european nations do n't have money to burn over the past several months , the european union has agreed to put together a rescue package worth billions of euros to ease greece 's financial woes , and agreed to another safety-net fund of several hundred billion euros to protect other nations from spiralling out of control like greece .
as europe 's largest economy , germany has picked up a large part of the tab .
european governments have also been launching austerity measures to head off a spread of the debt crisis begun in greece .
germany 's cabinet this month backed budget cuts worth about $ 105 billion - the country 's biggest postwar austerity program -through 2014 , while french president nicolas sarkozy this week raised the retirement age and increased taxes .
at odds with obama merkel 's stance heading into the g20 summit is contrary to that of president obama .
on friday , obama urged caution when it came to scaling back government spending . " our highest priority in toronto must be to safeguard and strengthen the recovery , " obama said in a letter to g20 leaders on june 16 . " we worked exceptionally hard to restore growth ; we can not falter or lose strength now .
this means that we should reaffirm our unity of purpose to provide the policy support necessary to keep economic growth strong , " he said . however , germany - and other members of the european union - are having to come to each other 's aid in a joint effort to protect the euro , shared by 16 of the eu 's members .
merkel has said that the billions the german government had already agreed to were in the greater interest of the euro currency , not individual member states . merkel also said that the european union would push again for a global financial transaction tax at the g20 meeting . germany and france support the introduction of the tax in europe but g20 hosts canada as well as britain are opposed to it . " there will certainly be controversial discussions about this but i am happy the european council reached a common stance on this for the g20 meeting , " merkel said . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 19.06.2010 private security firms in the balkans harbor corruption , observers say 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many security firms in the balkans are involved in corrupt dealings organized crime in southeastern europe often operates under cover of private security companies .
international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .
" after the wars , these links have endured and are still causing great harm to the quality of governance in the region . " read more about corruption in the balkans 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .

now the government has published a set of guidelines to help teachers identify and deal with cases where their students might be married off against their will . last month a 15-year-old girl from hamburg made headlines when she texted a friend and her teacher saying that she had been taken to berlin against her will and was being forced into a marriage by her serbian family .
the authorities were alerted and the youth welfare office intervened .
the girl recanted her story , however , and was returned to her family .
in an e-mail quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , her classmates contend she only changed the story under pressure from her parents .
if it were n't for her teacher , the world may never have known this girl 's story .
guidelines for dealing with ' abuse of human rights ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the guidelines will give teachers the right tools to deal with forced marriage recently the german government 's integration commissioner released a set of guidelines for schools dealing with potential cases of forced marriage .
" forced marriage is an abuse of human rights , " said commissioner maria boehmer .
" current mechanisms for helping young men and women threatened by forced marriage often come too late or not at all .
schools can play an important role here . "
one section of the guidelines , which will soon be made available to every school in the country , is a list of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women threatened by a forced marriage .
one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .

romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems .

" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .
" after the wars , these links have endured and are still causing great harm to the quality of governance in the region . " read more about corruption in the balkans 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .

romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems .

" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

now the government has published a set of guidelines to help teachers identify and deal with cases where their students might be married off against their will . last month a 15-year-old girl from hamburg made headlines when she texted a friend and her teacher saying that she had been taken to berlin against her will and was being forced into a marriage by her serbian family .
the authorities were alerted and the youth welfare office intervened .
the girl recanted her story , however , and was returned to her family .
in an e-mail quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , her classmates contend she only changed the story under pressure from her parents .
if it were n't for her teacher , the world may never have known this girl 's story .
guidelines for dealing with ' abuse of human rights ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the guidelines will give teachers the right tools to deal with forced marriage recently the german government 's integration commissioner released a set of guidelines for schools dealing with potential cases of forced marriage .
" forced marriage is an abuse of human rights , " said commissioner maria boehmer .
" current mechanisms for helping young men and women threatened by forced marriage often come too late or not at all .
schools can play an important role here . "
one section of the guidelines , which will soon be made available to every school in the country , is a list of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women threatened by a forced marriage .
one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

now the government has published a set of guidelines to help teachers identify and deal with cases where their students might be married off against their will . last month a 15-year-old girl from hamburg made headlines when she texted a friend and her teacher saying that she had been taken to berlin against her will and was being forced into a marriage by her serbian family .
the authorities were alerted and the youth welfare office intervened .
the girl recanted her story , however , and was returned to her family .
in an e-mail quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , her classmates contend she only changed the story under pressure from her parents .
if it were n't for her teacher , the world may never have known this girl 's story .
guidelines for dealing with ' abuse of human rights ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the guidelines will give teachers the right tools to deal with forced marriage recently the german government 's integration commissioner released a set of guidelines for schools dealing with potential cases of forced marriage .
" forced marriage is an abuse of human rights , " said commissioner maria boehmer .
" current mechanisms for helping young men and women threatened by forced marriage often come too late or not at all .
schools can play an important role here . "
one section of the guidelines , which will soon be made available to every school in the country , is a list of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women threatened by a forced marriage .
one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 19.06.2010 remake of popular german play is a hit in yemen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " linie 1 " has attracted viewers in yemen , where theater does n't have a big following " linie 1 " is among the most widely-performed german plays and the biggest success to date for berlin 's grips theater .
performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.06.2010 referees in the spotlight after a day of questionable decisions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was n't the same after going down to ten men fans of germany and the united states feel bad refereeing cost their teams points on friday in the world cup .
dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .

it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .

it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .

dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .

the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .

he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .

it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .
but perhaps we should start asking them to .
maybe a referee from an outlier country should have to apprentice in a top league for at least a year , or call some minimum number of games there , before he is eligible for the world cup .
at the very least there needs to be a radical expansion of existing referee exchange programs that bring officials from football 's smaller federations to the big leagues to shadow referees .
and those bangladeshi and namibian referees need to be put into league games too , once they 're ready .
it could be a tough pill to swallow for fans of the english premier league or the bundesliga , to look in their match program to see " referee : coffi codjia -lrb- benin -rrb- " on a saturday afternoon .
but it would certainly help the world game , and might just keep their national side from getting shafted at the next world cup .

dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.06.2010 estonia is ' most integrated country north of germany ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilves says estonains are " committed " to afghanistan skeptics have said greece 's debt crisis should have made estonia rethink adopting the euro , but estonian president toomas hendrik ilves says it was a natural step in the country 's european integration . at a european union summit on thursday , eu leaders voted to make estonia the latest country to adopt the euro .
the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.06.2010 referees in the spotlight after a day of questionable decisions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was n't the same after going down to ten men fans of germany and the united states feel bad refereeing cost their teams points on friday in the world cup .
dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coulibaly can smile and smile and still be a villain this goes for mali 's koman coulibaly as well .
the financial auditor from bamako is , by african standards , a vastly experienced referee .
he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .
but that is still not enough .
lacking the day-in-day-out challenge of calling games and feeling the consequent pressure at the highest level - and by that i mean europe or the top leagues in the americas -lrb- brazil , argentina , mexico -rrb- - the likes of coulibaly are simply not to be trusted at the world cup .
that they often fail is not their fault - it 's the biggest game they 've ever called , and they are overwhelmed by the situation .
fifa appoints these referees before they are ready for prime time out of a high-minded impulse .
it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .
moreover , fifa takes just one referee from each country , and thus countries like germany or france - both of which could probably offer 15 or more referees of a very high standard - send one , so as to make way for minnows .
development aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang stark is the only german ref at the world cup the best way to ensure a decent standard of refereeing across the board is a radical re-think - to begin viewing the grooming of refereeing talent much in the way players are brought along .
if you look at the rosters of most african or smaller latin american countries at the world cup , you will find relatively few players who are plying their trade at home .
check out those sides ' starting line-ups from the first two games , and you will see still fewer .
players know that if they wish to improve , they must go to the big leagues - referees must do the same .
it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .
but perhaps we should start asking them to .
maybe a referee from an outlier country should have to apprentice in a top league for at least a year , or call some minimum number of games there , before he is eligible for the world cup .
at the very least there needs to be a radical expansion of existing referee exchange programs that bring officials from football 's smaller federations to the big leagues to shadow referees .
and those bangladeshi and namibian referees need to be put into league games too , once they 're ready .
it could be a tough pill to swallow for fans of the english premier league or the bundesliga , to look in their match program to see " referee : coffi codjia -lrb- benin -rrb- " on a saturday afternoon .
but it would certainly help the world game , and might just keep their national side from getting shafted at the next world cup .

the campaign mood was sedate , even with topics like euro adoption and afghanistan up for debate . polls opened on sunday in poland 's presidential election , in a vote which many analysts are already anticipating will end inconclusively , leading to a second round of voting in two weeks .
but a recent opinion poll suggests center-right candidate and acting president bronislaw komorowski could scrape by with 51 percent of the vote , the minimum needed to avoid a run-off against right-wing candidate jaroslaw kaczynski .
the elections are being held early in poland this year after former president lech kaczynski was killed along with 95 others in a plane crash in russia on april 10 .
he was the twin brother of jaroslaw kaczynski , who has vowed to pick up where his brother left off .
as speaker of the parliament , komorowski became acting president after kaczynski 's death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's death thrust the nation into a state of mourning in poland , the president is not just a ceremonial figure .
he may hold less power than the prime minister but can still veto laws .
the country 's next president could play a role in the debate over adopting the euro and when to withdraw the country 's troops from nato 's mission in afghanistan .
komorowski has promised to withdraw polish troops from afghanistan , should he be elected .
he said the death of a polish soldier last weekend was " a signal to polish public opinion that something is not right with this mission . "
divided on the issues both komorowski and kaczynski are conservative catholics , but take a dramatically different approach to the euro and poland 's foreign relationships .
kaczynski , who was prime minster from 2006 to 2007 , could put the breaks on parliament as it takes steps toward the adoption of the euro .
" a win for jaroslaw kaczynski would be political hell , " prime minister donald tusk , of komorowski 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- , said recently .
kaczynski is known for his nationalistic stance , putting up a frosty front both to the european union and to russia .

but the global downturn has led to a budget deficit of 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the deceased kaczynski had often blocked efforts by the pro-business po party from enacting market reforms and his candidate brother opposes government privatization plans .
so far the po has failed to deliver on promises of raising the retirement age and bringing an end to pension privileges enjoyed by farmers and other groups .
party politicians have so far cited the risk of a presidential veto as a reason not to pursue those issues .
kaczynski 's right-wing law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- is nationalistic , euroskeptic and conservative on moral and social issues but swings left on the economy and favors more state spending .
a changed tone the death of lech kaczynski cast a shadow on the election , compounded by two consecutive waves of flooding that left 24 people dead in recent weeks .
" the politicians are using different words ; the campaigns are not as aggressive as they normally are in poland , " said joachim ciecierski , head of polish public radio 's german service .
" the atmosphere is calm , although you can sense a certain tension in the air because it is an important election . "
there 's also been a shift in the electorate .
before the plane crash , komorowski was seen as a shoo-in for the presidency .
but the death of their president has turned voters to the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has reached out to centrist voters in his campaign " somehow -lsb- komorowski -rsb- had taken this almost for granted , " andrzej krajewski of the civic development forum think tank , told deutsche welle .
" in opinion polls he was far ahead of his contenders , including president kaczynski , and now he 's in a very difficult position .
as acting president he will have to execute presidential power , which includes a lot of nominations and a lot of moves which will be measured against his presidency . "
kaczynski was known for his acerbic remarks but has toned down his rhetoric in this campaign in a bid to woo centrist voters .
" for now , jaroslaw is not obliging -lsb- po -rsb- and is playing the kindly old duffer who wants to use this national tragedy to overcome old animosities and unite the nation , " wrote preston keat of eurasia group , a political risk consultancy , in an analytical note this week .

new report reveals shocking state of german education system ha !
you think things are bad in germany ?

the world 's richest country should be the one with the best of everything , including standards of living and education , to name just two items - but sad to say , it is not ! - hal , us the problem experienced with the german school system is very simple .
german society focuses on the slow but steady development and process of individuals along traditional skills and contributions to society .
this is reflected in how children progress in development and schooling .
problems arise when you suddenly have a large number of non-germans to integrate along with their children who may or may not have been born in germany .
multicultural societies are dysfunctional .
all multicultural societies create is the permanent separation of visible immigrants or newcomers from the greater society .
the best approach is integration .
it may take one or two generations to achieve but it is the most natural , honest and wisest approach . - gerhard , canada hecs -lrb- higher education contribution scheme -rrb- fees for university students are outrageous in australia and suck the income of those graduates beginning careers after university .
most full-time university students live on the poverty line or below .
tafe -lrb- technical and further education -rrb- students do not fare much better with the fee structure for their courses , especially at diploma or higher level .
full time tafe students suffer similarly to university students with income .
many university and tafe students , when they are young people , rely on family for help whether it is accommodation or financial support .
the federal and state governments in australia could do more to help these people with their life while studying . - stuart , australia i thought you were discussing canada on your website in education .
the future belongs to countries that can work together . - malcolm , canada i attended school in germany up to the 10th grade .
i was enrolled in realschule and would have finished school that year if i had stayed in germany .
after moving to canada i continued to the 12th grade and then received a university degree .
i would not have been able to achieve that had i stayed in germany .
fourth grade is much too early to decide if a student has what it takes to attend university .
they should all be encouraged to do their best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.06.2010 german car suppliers face tough times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotive suppliers are assembling new strategies a new report says plenty of german car parts suppliers could still go belly up despite an upswing in the car industry .
but things may change as demand for new cars picks up . one in five german automotive suppliers still faces possible insolvency following one of the biggest crises in the global car manufacturing market , according to a new report published by d & b deutschland .
that 's slightly better than the one-in-three assessment made by a.t. kearny a year earlier .
but industry experts are n't celebrating just yet .
" i do n't see any sustainable stabilization , " michael seifert , author of the report , told deutsche welle .
" suppliers are benefitting from the upswing in some markets but it is not clear whether it 's enough for all of them to survive . "
core business germany is home to more than 5,300 companies supplying components not only to the country 's big carmakers , such as bmw , daimler and volkswagen , but also to manufacturers worldwide .
more than half of these make automotive parts as their core business .
altogether , the suppliers employ more than 300,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch is a tier one automotive supplier with global operations the situation in germany 's auto components sector is complex and complicated , according to seifert .
the expert cites as an example last year 's cash-for-clunkers program to promote new car sales .
" the program helped boost sales but is now winding down for suppliers as they work through the contracts , " he said .
and with no new incentive program in the pipeline , it 's unclear what could stimulate demand in a weak economy .
automotive suppliers in germany , especially the some 2,500 companies that manufacture components as their core business , are pretty much at the mercy of carmakers .
christoph stuermer , an automotive analyst with his global insight , likens the situation to a train .
" when the locomotive accelerates , the back of the train needs to push , " he said .
" when the loc slams on the brakes , the wheels of the caboose are smoking . "
following in carmakers ' footsteps auto component makers in germany face a number of challenges .
for one , german carmakers are expanding in the growth markets china , india and latin america , far away from many of their traditional suppliers and close to new , low-cost competitors .
but stuermer believes automotive suppliers in germany are well positioned to meet these and other challenges .
the tier one suppliers , he said , already operate globally and will follow in the footsteps of their customers and there will still be plenty of demand domestically to sustain growth in traditional markets .
but stuermer is quick to admit that competition among automotive suppliers is as fierce as it comes and will fuel consolidation , forcing some players out of the market .
" moving ahead , suppliers in germany will have to differentiate themselves even more than they have in the past , " he said .
" and they can do that by manufacturing still more efficiently through intelligent systems and by placing an even greater emphasis on innovation , where they have plenty of strengths . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 19.06.2010 private security firms in the balkans harbor corruption , observers say 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many security firms in the balkans are involved in corrupt dealings organized crime in southeastern europe often operates under cover of private security companies .
international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .
" after the wars , these links have endured and are still causing great harm to the quality of governance in the region . " read more about corruption in the balkans 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .

they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems .

" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .

a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .
" after the wars , these links have endured and are still causing great harm to the quality of governance in the region . " read more about corruption in the balkans 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.06.2010 close election expected as polls open in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts predict the vote will be close polls have opened in the presidential election in poland , which was triggered by the death of president lech kaczynski .
the campaign mood was sedate , even with topics like euro adoption and afghanistan up for debate . polls opened on sunday in poland 's presidential election , in a vote which many analysts are already anticipating will end inconclusively , leading to a second round of voting in two weeks .
but a recent opinion poll suggests center-right candidate and acting president bronislaw komorowski could scrape by with 51 percent of the vote , the minimum needed to avoid a run-off against right-wing candidate jaroslaw kaczynski .
the elections are being held early in poland this year after former president lech kaczynski was killed along with 95 others in a plane crash in russia on april 10 .
he was the twin brother of jaroslaw kaczynski , who has vowed to pick up where his brother left off .
as speaker of the parliament , komorowski became acting president after kaczynski 's death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's death thrust the nation into a state of mourning in poland , the president is not just a ceremonial figure .
he may hold less power than the prime minister but can still veto laws .
the country 's next president could play a role in the debate over adopting the euro and when to withdraw the country 's troops from nato 's mission in afghanistan .
komorowski has promised to withdraw polish troops from afghanistan , should he be elected .
he said the death of a polish soldier last weekend was " a signal to polish public opinion that something is not right with this mission . "
divided on the issues both komorowski and kaczynski are conservative catholics , but take a dramatically different approach to the euro and poland 's foreign relationships .
kaczynski , who was prime minster from 2006 to 2007 , could put the breaks on parliament as it takes steps toward the adoption of the euro .
" a win for jaroslaw kaczynski would be political hell , " prime minister donald tusk , of komorowski 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- , said recently .
kaczynski is known for his nationalistic stance , putting up a frosty front both to the european union and to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if komorowski wins , the po will control the office of the prime minister and president poland was the only one of the 27 eu countries that did not experience a recession last year .
but the global downturn has led to a budget deficit of 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the deceased kaczynski had often blocked efforts by the pro-business po party from enacting market reforms and his candidate brother opposes government privatization plans .
so far the po has failed to deliver on promises of raising the retirement age and bringing an end to pension privileges enjoyed by farmers and other groups .
party politicians have so far cited the risk of a presidential veto as a reason not to pursue those issues .
kaczynski 's right-wing law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- is nationalistic , euroskeptic and conservative on moral and social issues but swings left on the economy and favors more state spending .
a changed tone the death of lech kaczynski cast a shadow on the election , compounded by two consecutive waves of flooding that left 24 people dead in recent weeks .
" the politicians are using different words ; the campaigns are not as aggressive as they normally are in poland , " said joachim ciecierski , head of polish public radio 's german service .
" the atmosphere is calm , although you can sense a certain tension in the air because it is an important election . "
there 's also been a shift in the electorate .
before the plane crash , komorowski was seen as a shoo-in for the presidency .
but the death of their president has turned voters to the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has reached out to centrist voters in his campaign " somehow -lsb- komorowski -rsb- had taken this almost for granted , " andrzej krajewski of the civic development forum think tank , told deutsche welle .
" in opinion polls he was far ahead of his contenders , including president kaczynski , and now he 's in a very difficult position .
as acting president he will have to execute presidential power , which includes a lot of nominations and a lot of moves which will be measured against his presidency . "
kaczynski was known for his acerbic remarks but has toned down his rhetoric in this campaign in a bid to woo centrist voters .
" for now , jaroslaw is not obliging -lsb- po -rsb- and is playing the kindly old duffer who wants to use this national tragedy to overcome old animosities and unite the nation , " wrote preston keat of eurasia group , a political risk consultancy , in an analytical note this week .

leaders of the 20 biggest developed and developing economies meet on june 26-27 in toronto , canada .
in her weekly podcast , merkel said from a european perspective , keeping an eye on avoiding future economic problems takes priority .
" for the european parties involved , and especially germany , it is urgently necessary to prevent crises like this from ever happening again in the future , " she said .
economic growth must be sustainable , environmentally friendly and oriented towards the future , merkel said .

european governments have also been launching austerity measures to head off a spread of the debt crisis begun in greece .
germany 's cabinet this month backed budget cuts worth about $ 105 billion - the country 's biggest postwar austerity program -through 2014 , while french president nicolas sarkozy this week raised the retirement age and increased taxes .
at odds with obama merkel 's stance heading into the g20 summit is contrary to that of president obama .
on friday , obama urged caution when it came to scaling back government spending . " our highest priority in toronto must be to safeguard and strengthen the recovery , " obama said in a letter to g20 leaders on june 16 . " we worked exceptionally hard to restore growth ; we can not falter or lose strength now .
this means that we should reaffirm our unity of purpose to provide the policy support necessary to keep economic growth strong , " he said . however , germany - and other members of the european union - are having to come to each other 's aid in a joint effort to protect the euro , shared by 16 of the eu 's members .
merkel has said that the billions the german government had already agreed to were in the greater interest of the euro currency , not individual member states . merkel also said that the european union would push again for a global financial transaction tax at the g20 meeting . germany and france support the introduction of the tax in europe but g20 hosts canada as well as britain are opposed to it . " there will certainly be controversial discussions about this but i am happy the european council reached a common stance on this for the g20 meeting , " merkel said . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.06.2010 close election expected as polls open in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts predict the vote will be close polls have opened in the presidential election in poland , which was triggered by the death of president lech kaczynski .
the campaign mood was sedate , even with topics like euro adoption and afghanistan up for debate . polls opened on sunday in poland 's presidential election , in a vote which many analysts are already anticipating will end inconclusively , leading to a second round of voting in two weeks .
but a recent opinion poll suggests center-right candidate and acting president bronislaw komorowski could scrape by with 51 percent of the vote , the minimum needed to avoid a run-off against right-wing candidate jaroslaw kaczynski .
the elections are being held early in poland this year after former president lech kaczynski was killed along with 95 others in a plane crash in russia on april 10 .
he was the twin brother of jaroslaw kaczynski , who has vowed to pick up where his brother left off .
as speaker of the parliament , komorowski became acting president after kaczynski 's death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's death thrust the nation into a state of mourning in poland , the president is not just a ceremonial figure .
he may hold less power than the prime minister but can still veto laws .
the country 's next president could play a role in the debate over adopting the euro and when to withdraw the country 's troops from nato 's mission in afghanistan .
komorowski has promised to withdraw polish troops from afghanistan , should he be elected .
he said the death of a polish soldier last weekend was " a signal to polish public opinion that something is not right with this mission . "
divided on the issues both komorowski and kaczynski are conservative catholics , but take a dramatically different approach to the euro and poland 's foreign relationships .
kaczynski , who was prime minster from 2006 to 2007 , could put the breaks on parliament as it takes steps toward the adoption of the euro .
" a win for jaroslaw kaczynski would be political hell , " prime minister donald tusk , of komorowski 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- , said recently .
kaczynski is known for his nationalistic stance , putting up a frosty front both to the european union and to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if komorowski wins , the po will control the office of the prime minister and president poland was the only one of the 27 eu countries that did not experience a recession last year .
but the global downturn has led to a budget deficit of 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the deceased kaczynski had often blocked efforts by the pro-business po party from enacting market reforms and his candidate brother opposes government privatization plans .
so far the po has failed to deliver on promises of raising the retirement age and bringing an end to pension privileges enjoyed by farmers and other groups .
party politicians have so far cited the risk of a presidential veto as a reason not to pursue those issues .
kaczynski 's right-wing law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- is nationalistic , euroskeptic and conservative on moral and social issues but swings left on the economy and favors more state spending .
a changed tone the death of lech kaczynski cast a shadow on the election , compounded by two consecutive waves of flooding that left 24 people dead in recent weeks .
" the politicians are using different words ; the campaigns are not as aggressive as they normally are in poland , " said joachim ciecierski , head of polish public radio 's german service .
" the atmosphere is calm , although you can sense a certain tension in the air because it is an important election . "
there 's also been a shift in the electorate .
before the plane crash , komorowski was seen as a shoo-in for the presidency .
but the death of their president has turned voters to the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has reached out to centrist voters in his campaign " somehow -lsb- komorowski -rsb- had taken this almost for granted , " andrzej krajewski of the civic development forum think tank , told deutsche welle .
" in opinion polls he was far ahead of his contenders , including president kaczynski , and now he 's in a very difficult position .
as acting president he will have to execute presidential power , which includes a lot of nominations and a lot of moves which will be measured against his presidency . "
kaczynski was known for his acerbic remarks but has toned down his rhetoric in this campaign in a bid to woo centrist voters .
" for now , jaroslaw is not obliging -lsb- po -rsb- and is playing the kindly old duffer who wants to use this national tragedy to overcome old animosities and unite the nation , " wrote preston keat of eurasia group , a political risk consultancy , in an analytical note this week .

the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

new report reveals shocking state of german education system ha !
you think things are bad in germany ?
go to the us and see what lack of education really looks like .
the world 's richest country should be the one with the best of everything , including standards of living and education , to name just two items - but sad to say , it is not ! - hal , us the problem experienced with the german school system is very simple .
german society focuses on the slow but steady development and process of individuals along traditional skills and contributions to society .
this is reflected in how children progress in development and schooling .
problems arise when you suddenly have a large number of non-germans to integrate along with their children who may or may not have been born in germany .
multicultural societies are dysfunctional .
all multicultural societies create is the permanent separation of visible immigrants or newcomers from the greater society .
the best approach is integration .
it may take one or two generations to achieve but it is the most natural , honest and wisest approach . - gerhard , canada hecs -lrb- higher education contribution scheme -rrb- fees for university students are outrageous in australia and suck the income of those graduates beginning careers after university .
most full-time university students live on the poverty line or below .
tafe -lrb- technical and further education -rrb- students do not fare much better with the fee structure for their courses , especially at diploma or higher level .
full time tafe students suffer similarly to university students with income .
many university and tafe students , when they are young people , rely on family for help whether it is accommodation or financial support .
the federal and state governments in australia could do more to help these people with their life while studying . - stuart , australia i thought you were discussing canada on your website in education .
the future belongs to countries that can work together . - malcolm , canada i attended school in germany up to the 10th grade .
i was enrolled in realschule and would have finished school that year if i had stayed in germany .
after moving to canada i continued to the 12th grade and then received a university degree .
i would not have been able to achieve that had i stayed in germany .
fourth grade is much too early to decide if a student has what it takes to attend university .
they should all be encouraged to do their best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.06.2010 german car suppliers face tough times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotive suppliers are assembling new strategies a new report says plenty of german car parts suppliers could still go belly up despite an upswing in the car industry .
but things may change as demand for new cars picks up . one in five german automotive suppliers still faces possible insolvency following one of the biggest crises in the global car manufacturing market , according to a new report published by d & b deutschland .
that 's slightly better than the one-in-three assessment made by a.t. kearny a year earlier .
but industry experts are n't celebrating just yet .
" i do n't see any sustainable stabilization , " michael seifert , author of the report , told deutsche welle .
" suppliers are benefitting from the upswing in some markets but it is not clear whether it 's enough for all of them to survive . "
core business germany is home to more than 5,300 companies supplying components not only to the country 's big carmakers , such as bmw , daimler and volkswagen , but also to manufacturers worldwide .
more than half of these make automotive parts as their core business .
altogether , the suppliers employ more than 300,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch is a tier one automotive supplier with global operations the situation in germany 's auto components sector is complex and complicated , according to seifert .
the expert cites as an example last year 's cash-for-clunkers program to promote new car sales .
" the program helped boost sales but is now winding down for suppliers as they work through the contracts , " he said .
and with no new incentive program in the pipeline , it 's unclear what could stimulate demand in a weak economy .
automotive suppliers in germany , especially the some 2,500 companies that manufacture components as their core business , are pretty much at the mercy of carmakers .
christoph stuermer , an automotive analyst with his global insight , likens the situation to a train .
" when the locomotive accelerates , the back of the train needs to push , " he said .
" when the loc slams on the brakes , the wheels of the caboose are smoking . "
following in carmakers ' footsteps auto component makers in germany face a number of challenges .
for one , german carmakers are expanding in the growth markets china , india and latin america , far away from many of their traditional suppliers and close to new , low-cost competitors .
but stuermer believes automotive suppliers in germany are well positioned to meet these and other challenges .
the tier one suppliers , he said , already operate globally and will follow in the footsteps of their customers and there will still be plenty of demand domestically to sustain growth in traditional markets .
but stuermer is quick to admit that competition among automotive suppliers is as fierce as it comes and will fuel consolidation , forcing some players out of the market .
" moving ahead , suppliers in germany will have to differentiate themselves even more than they have in the past , " he said .
" and they can do that by manufacturing still more efficiently through intelligent systems and by placing an even greater emphasis on innovation , where they have plenty of strengths . "

new report reveals shocking state of german education system ha !
you think things are bad in germany ?
go to the us and see what lack of education really looks like .
the world 's richest country should be the one with the best of everything , including standards of living and education , to name just two items - but sad to say , it is not ! - hal , us the problem experienced with the german school system is very simple .
german society focuses on the slow but steady development and process of individuals along traditional skills and contributions to society .
this is reflected in how children progress in development and schooling .
problems arise when you suddenly have a large number of non-germans to integrate along with their children who may or may not have been born in germany .
multicultural societies are dysfunctional .
all multicultural societies create is the permanent separation of visible immigrants or newcomers from the greater society .
the best approach is integration .
it may take one or two generations to achieve but it is the most natural , honest and wisest approach . - gerhard , canada hecs -lrb- higher education contribution scheme -rrb- fees for university students are outrageous in australia and suck the income of those graduates beginning careers after university .
most full-time university students live on the poverty line or below .
tafe -lrb- technical and further education -rrb- students do not fare much better with the fee structure for their courses , especially at diploma or higher level .
full time tafe students suffer similarly to university students with income .
many university and tafe students , when they are young people , rely on family for help whether it is accommodation or financial support .
the federal and state governments in australia could do more to help these people with their life while studying . - stuart , australia i thought you were discussing canada on your website in education .
the future belongs to countries that can work together . - malcolm , canada i attended school in germany up to the 10th grade .
i was enrolled in realschule and would have finished school that year if i had stayed in germany .
after moving to canada i continued to the 12th grade and then received a university degree .
i would not have been able to achieve that had i stayed in germany .
fourth grade is much too early to decide if a student has what it takes to attend university .
they should all be encouraged to do their best .
i 'm not saying our system in canada is great , but at least we are all given the chance to prove ourselves . - silvia , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.06.2010 netherlands advance thanks to danish favor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning games - the only sure ticket to the knockout round the netherlands needed denmark to win or draw against cameroon to secure a spot in the knockout round of the world cup finals .
the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders of the 20 biggest developed and developing economies meet on june 26-27 in toronto , canada .
in her weekly podcast , merkel said from a european perspective , keeping an eye on avoiding future economic problems takes priority .
" for the european parties involved , and especially germany , it is urgently necessary to prevent crises like this from ever happening again in the future , " she said .
economic growth must be sustainable , environmentally friendly and oriented towards the future , merkel said .
eu nations on austerity drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes european nations do n't have money to burn over the past several months , the european union has agreed to put together a rescue package worth billions of euros to ease greece 's financial woes , and agreed to another safety-net fund of several hundred billion euros to protect other nations from spiralling out of control like greece .
as europe 's largest economy , germany has picked up a large part of the tab .
european governments have also been launching austerity measures to head off a spread of the debt crisis begun in greece .
germany 's cabinet this month backed budget cuts worth about $ 105 billion - the country 's biggest postwar austerity program -through 2014 , while french president nicolas sarkozy this week raised the retirement age and increased taxes .
at odds with obama merkel 's stance heading into the g20 summit is contrary to that of president obama .
on friday , obama urged caution when it came to scaling back government spending . " our highest priority in toronto must be to safeguard and strengthen the recovery , " obama said in a letter to g20 leaders on june 16 . " we worked exceptionally hard to restore growth ; we can not falter or lose strength now .
this means that we should reaffirm our unity of purpose to provide the policy support necessary to keep economic growth strong , " he said . however , germany - and other members of the european union - are having to come to each other 's aid in a joint effort to protect the euro , shared by 16 of the eu 's members .
merkel has said that the billions the german government had already agreed to were in the greater interest of the euro currency , not individual member states . merkel also said that the european union would push again for a global financial transaction tax at the g20 meeting . germany and france support the introduction of the tax in europe but g20 hosts canada as well as britain are opposed to it . " there will certainly be controversial discussions about this but i am happy the european council reached a common stance on this for the g20 meeting , " merkel said . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

now the government has published a set of guidelines to help teachers identify and deal with cases where their students might be married off against their will . last month a 15-year-old girl from hamburg made headlines when she texted a friend and her teacher saying that she had been taken to berlin against her will and was being forced into a marriage by her serbian family .
the authorities were alerted and the youth welfare office intervened .
the girl recanted her story , however , and was returned to her family .
in an e-mail quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , her classmates contend she only changed the story under pressure from her parents .
if it were n't for her teacher , the world may never have known this girl 's story .
guidelines for dealing with ' abuse of human rights ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the guidelines will give teachers the right tools to deal with forced marriage recently the german government 's integration commissioner released a set of guidelines for schools dealing with potential cases of forced marriage .
" forced marriage is an abuse of human rights , " said commissioner maria boehmer .
" current mechanisms for helping young men and women threatened by forced marriage often come too late or not at all .
schools can play an important role here . "
one section of the guidelines , which will soon be made available to every school in the country , is a list of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women threatened by a forced marriage .
one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coulibaly can smile and smile and still be a villain this goes for mali 's koman coulibaly as well .
the financial auditor from bamako is , by african standards , a vastly experienced referee .
he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .
but that is still not enough .
lacking the day-in-day-out challenge of calling games and feeling the consequent pressure at the highest level - and by that i mean europe or the top leagues in the americas -lrb- brazil , argentina , mexico -rrb- - the likes of coulibaly are simply not to be trusted at the world cup .
that they often fail is not their fault - it 's the biggest game they 've ever called , and they are overwhelmed by the situation .
fifa appoints these referees before they are ready for prime time out of a high-minded impulse .
it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .
moreover , fifa takes just one referee from each country , and thus countries like germany or france - both of which could probably offer 15 or more referees of a very high standard - send one , so as to make way for minnows .
development aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang stark is the only german ref at the world cup the best way to ensure a decent standard of refereeing across the board is a radical re-think - to begin viewing the grooming of refereeing talent much in the way players are brought along .
if you look at the rosters of most african or smaller latin american countries at the world cup , you will find relatively few players who are plying their trade at home .
check out those sides ' starting line-ups from the first two games , and you will see still fewer .
players know that if they wish to improve , they must go to the big leagues - referees must do the same .
it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .
but perhaps we should start asking them to .
maybe a referee from an outlier country should have to apprentice in a top league for at least a year , or call some minimum number of games there , before he is eligible for the world cup .
at the very least there needs to be a radical expansion of existing referee exchange programs that bring officials from football 's smaller federations to the big leagues to shadow referees .
and those bangladeshi and namibian referees need to be put into league games too , once they 're ready .
it could be a tough pill to swallow for fans of the english premier league or the bundesliga , to look in their match program to see " referee : coffi codjia -lrb- benin -rrb- " on a saturday afternoon .
but it would certainly help the world game , and might just keep their national side from getting shafted at the next world cup .

football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .
with that in mind , fifa goes into each world cup issuing directives to its referees to take a hard line on many of the negative tactics favored by defenders .
" absolutely no shirt pulling ! "
" dissent will be punished in every instance ! "
" tackling from behind results in a yellow card , without exception ! "
-lrb- miro klose fell foul of this one on his second yellow . -rrb-
it 's a noble effort , this attempt to unleash the game 's offensive firepower by punishing its destroyers .
but it does n't work , for two reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , undiano could n't stop at just one first , it puts the referees themselves at the center of the game - not the attacking maestros they are meant to be protecting .
the germany-serbia match was not a rough encounter , even by the relatively soft standard of the world cup , but undiano still managed to hand out a whopping nine yellow cards , including the two which added up to klose 's red .
instead of witnessing a free-flowing offensive spectacle of red and white shirts going end to end for goals , viewers were treated to a fitful , stop-start affair which hung on the whistle of the man in black .
fifa , with the help of its individual football associations , scours the globe for refereeing talent for four years leading up to the world cup .
the men who are chosen to call world cup games have certainly done much right in that time , and are known as one of the best in their respective countries - as is undiano in spain 's primera division .
why not just let them call games as they like ?
second , refereeing is as much art as science , requiring a firm but flexible hand - not just a list of hard-and-fast directives .
a good ref has many more arrows in his quiver than the two colored cards he carries in his breast pockets , and the way the best ones earn their reputation over the years is for mastering this craft .
a stern lecture here , a quick reminder of how-many-times-he 's-seen-you-fouling there , and the game is brought under control without yellow and red bombs bursting in air .
tell a referee that he must issue a yellow card for every challenge from behind , and his hands are tied .
sometimes he must dismiss a striker in the first half for two soft tackles .
and fans are the worse off for it .
regional differences fifa 's hardliner act that it puts on before each world cup also has something to do with the disparate origins of the pool of referees at the tournament .
-lrb- 30 of them from 28 different countries this time out , to be exact . -rrb-
the world body believes it has to set a universal standard , so that germany 's wolfgang stark calls his games precisely the same way as eddy maillet of the seychelles .
if the appearance of " the seychelles " in that last sentence did n't give you pause , it should have .
not to single out maillet for criticism -lrb- by most accounts he turned in a poor , but far from scandalous , performance in the chile-honduras game -rrb- but nobody from the seychelles should be anywhere nearer a world cup pitch than the first few rows of the stands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coulibaly can smile and smile and still be a villain this goes for mali 's koman coulibaly as well .
the financial auditor from bamako is , by african standards , a vastly experienced referee .
he 's been at it for 16 years , rising through the ranks of the malian league and beginning as a referee at international tournaments at the africa cup of nations 2002 .
but that is still not enough .
lacking the day-in-day-out challenge of calling games and feeling the consequent pressure at the highest level - and by that i mean europe or the top leagues in the americas -lrb- brazil , argentina , mexico -rrb- - the likes of coulibaly are simply not to be trusted at the world cup .
that they often fail is not their fault - it 's the biggest game they 've ever called , and they are overwhelmed by the situation .
fifa appoints these referees before they are ready for prime time out of a high-minded impulse .
it hopes to improve the standard of world refereeing by offering officials from small countries more top-level experience , and it wishes to give countries with slim hope of their teams ' qualifying for the competition -lrb- el salvador , malaysia , etc . -rrb- a stake in the tournament .
moreover , fifa takes just one referee from each country , and thus countries like germany or france - both of which could probably offer 15 or more referees of a very high standard - send one , so as to make way for minnows .
development aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang stark is the only german ref at the world cup the best way to ensure a decent standard of refereeing across the board is a radical re-think - to begin viewing the grooming of refereeing talent much in the way players are brought along .
if you look at the rosters of most african or smaller latin american countries at the world cup , you will find relatively few players who are plying their trade at home .
check out those sides ' starting line-ups from the first two games , and you will see still fewer .
players know that if they wish to improve , they must go to the big leagues - referees must do the same .
it 's true that referees at present are not full-time paid professionals who can be expected to leave their homes and jobs in guatemala city or tashkent to pursue their dreams of refereeing in a world cup by apprenticing in the bundesliga or the mexican football league .
but perhaps we should start asking them to .
maybe a referee from an outlier country should have to apprentice in a top league for at least a year , or call some minimum number of games there , before he is eligible for the world cup .
at the very least there needs to be a radical expansion of existing referee exchange programs that bring officials from football 's smaller federations to the big leagues to shadow referees .
and those bangladeshi and namibian referees need to be put into league games too , once they 're ready .
it could be a tough pill to swallow for fans of the english premier league or the bundesliga , to look in their match program to see " referee : coffi codjia -lrb- benin -rrb- " on a saturday afternoon .
but it would certainly help the world game , and might just keep their national side from getting shafted at the next world cup .

dw sports editor matt hermann takes a closer look at their cases , and what 's to be done . we was robbed .
they 're three of the bitterest , yet oddly satisfying words in the sports fan 's arsenal .
passing off the blame for a loss lightens one 's own load of sorrow , and besides provides a straw man to take pokes at . after a day like friday at the world cup , german and us fans alike are united in rage at the men fifa assigned to take charge of their second group stage games .
both have good reason to be upset .
germany 's miroslav klose was sent off by spanish referee alberto undiano just 37 minutes into his team 's match against serbia , having collected two yellow cards for two fouls , neither of which seemed particularly caution-worthy .
after klose 's dismissal , the game turned .
serbia scored within a minute , and germany 's fight-back , initially spirited , eventually descended into rushed , sloppy desperation .
serbia could , and probably should , have won by more .
the united states were put at an even greater disadvantage by the refereeing decisions of koman coulibaly of mali .
the americans had completed a stirring rally from two goals down at the half to tie the match in the 82nd minute and , it appeared to most viewers , had taken the lead four minutes later on maurice edu 's stabbing shot off of a landon donovan free kick .
but coulibaly called the goal back on a phantom foul , and the us took one point from the match instead of three .
bildunterschrift : michael bradley , right , was not the only one furious by the disallowed us goal calls like these are upsetting in the extreme - especially when they influence or even decide the results of games in the high-profile setting of the world cup .
but decisively bad calls are part of the game , and have happened before - ask an irishman , for starters .
what the refereeing problems in these two friday games share , however , is that they both bear the hallmark of systemic problems in fifa 's handling of referee selection at the world cup .
top-down , or race to the bottom ?
football fans the world over will tell you that they go to the stadium or switch on their tv set to see skillful , positive offensive play - and wish to see the stars that can produce that play protected from the cynical fouls of less talented players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.06.2010 netherlands advance thanks to danish favor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning games - the only sure ticket to the knockout round the netherlands needed denmark to win or draw against cameroon to secure a spot in the knockout round of the world cup finals .
the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

now the government has published a set of guidelines to help teachers identify and deal with cases where their students might be married off against their will . last month a 15-year-old girl from hamburg made headlines when she texted a friend and her teacher saying that she had been taken to berlin against her will and was being forced into a marriage by her serbian family .
the authorities were alerted and the youth welfare office intervened .
the girl recanted her story , however , and was returned to her family .
in an e-mail quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , her classmates contend she only changed the story under pressure from her parents .
if it were n't for her teacher , the world may never have known this girl 's story .
guidelines for dealing with ' abuse of human rights ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the guidelines will give teachers the right tools to deal with forced marriage recently the german government 's integration commissioner released a set of guidelines for schools dealing with potential cases of forced marriage .
" forced marriage is an abuse of human rights , " said commissioner maria boehmer .
" current mechanisms for helping young men and women threatened by forced marriage often come too late or not at all .
schools can play an important role here . "
one section of the guidelines , which will soon be made available to every school in the country , is a list of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women threatened by a forced marriage .
one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .

now the government has published a set of guidelines to help teachers identify and deal with cases where their students might be married off against their will . last month a 15-year-old girl from hamburg made headlines when she texted a friend and her teacher saying that she had been taken to berlin against her will and was being forced into a marriage by her serbian family .
the authorities were alerted and the youth welfare office intervened .
the girl recanted her story , however , and was returned to her family .
in an e-mail quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , her classmates contend she only changed the story under pressure from her parents .
if it were n't for her teacher , the world may never have known this girl 's story .
guidelines for dealing with ' abuse of human rights ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the guidelines will give teachers the right tools to deal with forced marriage recently the german government 's integration commissioner released a set of guidelines for schools dealing with potential cases of forced marriage .
" forced marriage is an abuse of human rights , " said commissioner maria boehmer .
" current mechanisms for helping young men and women threatened by forced marriage often come too late or not at all .
schools can play an important role here . "
one section of the guidelines , which will soon be made available to every school in the country , is a list of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women threatened by a forced marriage .
one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

the danes did their part , and the world cup has its first team in the round of 16 . the only thing the netherlands needed to secure their spot in the knockout round of the world cup was a strong performance by denmark to at least hold cameroon to a draw in the last match of saturday night .
the danes did their part and beat cameroon 2-1 , giving the world cup its first team in the round of 16 . the netherlands ' advance from the group stage comes at the expense of cameroon , who are now eliminated from playing in the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone can go home from the world cup happy denmark 's victory was far from assured as a defensive mistake gave cameroon the lead early on .
danish defender christian poulsen was a bit too casual with a pass on his own side of the field and was intercepted by achille emana .
emana found samuel eto 'o near the penalty spot and crossed for an easy goal in the 10th minute . denmark equalized in the 35th minute on a brilliant long ball from the back by simon kjaer that found dennis rommedahl breaking down the right side .
his cross was right on the money for nicklas bendtner , whose sliding shot had no chance of being stopped by cameroon 's keeper , hamidou souleymanou . a 1-1 draw would have been enough to send the netherlands through to the next round and would have also kept cameroon in the tournament .
but denmark was n't finished and added the final goal of the game in style .
in the 61st minute , rommedahl faced off with cameroon defender jean makoun in the area .
rommedahl 's fancy footwork left makoun in the dust , freeing the dane up for a curling shot past souleymanou . the last game of this group e takes place on thursday .
japan and denmark are playing for a slot in the next round , while cameroon simply has its pride at stake against the netherlands . germany 's group up for grabs ghana 's 1-1 draw against australia in group d earlier in the day put the african country on top of the group .
all four teams in the group , which also includes germany and serbia , still have a shot at advancing to the knockout round of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both of ghana 's world cup goals have come from penalties taken by gyan however , the socceroos ' chances would have benefitted greatly from a win against ghana , and three points seemed like a possibility for the australians as they got the game off on the right foot by taking the lead early on . midfielder mark bresciano took a free kick from about 30 meters in the 11th minute , sending a curling shot over the wall that gave ghana 's keeper richard kingson some serious trouble .
the ball bounced just in front of kingson and then hit him in the chest .
he missed the catch and fumbled the ball back into play , where australia 's brett holman was there to blast in the rebound . australia 's lead was erased a bit later in the first half after a tough call from italian referee roberto rosetti .
ghana took a corner that found asamoah gyan in the middle of the box , who lined up for a goal-bound strike that seemed destined to go in .
however , right in the path of the ball was australian striker harry kewell , who attempted to use his chest to block the shot .
rather than striking him on the chest , however , the ball hit kewell 's right arm , and rosetti immediately whistled the play dead .
he showed kewell a red card and awarded ghana a penalty .
gyan took the kick and tied the game at 1-1 .
it was his second goal of the world cup .
the first was also a penalty against serbia . uphill climb for australia despite playing with 10 men , the australians were able to keep ghana at bay for most of the rest of the game and even had a few chances to regain the lead in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach loew in the stands at the ghana match in the 72nd minute , luke wilkshire was fed the ball cleanly through the middle but his shot was directly at kingson , who deflected the ball with his knee .
it landed in front of australia 's josh kennedy , who only managed a chip shot off the ground that sailed high into the air , giving kingson enough time to get up and catch it before it became a threat . ghana was not entirely without goal chances , however , and their best came just a minute before wilkshire and kennedy 's double miss .
gyan only had australian keeper mark schwarzer to beat after a promising through-ball by kevin-prince boateng , but curved his shot wide of the goal . although mathematically still alive in the group , australia face the toughest challenge in advancing to the round of 16 .
they take on serbia wednesday in the group 's final match .
a win for australia , combined with a loss for germany against ghana , is the only way australia can still advance . germany is more or less in a must-win situation against ghana as well .
a win would guarantee the germans a spot in the round of 16 , but a draw could leave the door open for serbia , who would advance instead of germany with a win over australia .
in the event of a german loss , a draw would suffice to advance the serbs . netherlands bound for ko round of course , the easiest path to the knockout round is to win every group match , avoiding nail-biting situations that come down to goal differentials and the outcome of games between other teams .
so far , only two teams have taken this path of least resistance in south africa .
argentina won their second game on thursday , and the netherlands beat japan 1-0 in saturday 's first match , before the decisive game between denmark and cameroon . it was a timid game in the first half , with the dutch pressing but unable to accomplish more than a passing clinic on the japanese side of the field . wesley sneijder had the best scoring opportunity for the netherlands in the first half , launching a free kick over the goal . japan rallied toward the end of the first half , taking control but failing to create scoring chances , and the teams went into the locker rooms at half time tied 0-0 . bildunterschrift : japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only manage a deflection of sneijder 's powerful shot the dutch came out fired up for the second half , however , and retook control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the oranje dialed up the pressure on the japanese defense .
a free ball made its way to the edge of the area , where a waiting wesley sneijder pulled back and fired a blast that japanese keeper eiji kawashima could only deflect into the net . another change for the netherlands came with just two minutes left in regulation , when ibrahim afellay directly challenged kawashima , who managed to hold the dutch substitute 's shot . japan very nearly evened things up in the closing moments of the game , but a last-second press by shinji okazaki was just over the crossbar . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / sid -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders of the 20 biggest developed and developing economies meet on june 26-27 in toronto , canada .
in her weekly podcast , merkel said from a european perspective , keeping an eye on avoiding future economic problems takes priority .
" for the european parties involved , and especially germany , it is urgently necessary to prevent crises like this from ever happening again in the future , " she said .
economic growth must be sustainable , environmentally friendly and oriented towards the future , merkel said .
eu nations on austerity drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes european nations do n't have money to burn over the past several months , the european union has agreed to put together a rescue package worth billions of euros to ease greece 's financial woes , and agreed to another safety-net fund of several hundred billion euros to protect other nations from spiralling out of control like greece .
as europe 's largest economy , germany has picked up a large part of the tab .
european governments have also been launching austerity measures to head off a spread of the debt crisis begun in greece .
germany 's cabinet this month backed budget cuts worth about $ 105 billion - the country 's biggest postwar austerity program -through 2014 , while french president nicolas sarkozy this week raised the retirement age and increased taxes .
at odds with obama merkel 's stance heading into the g20 summit is contrary to that of president obama .
on friday , obama urged caution when it came to scaling back government spending . " our highest priority in toronto must be to safeguard and strengthen the recovery , " obama said in a letter to g20 leaders on june 16 . " we worked exceptionally hard to restore growth ; we can not falter or lose strength now .
this means that we should reaffirm our unity of purpose to provide the policy support necessary to keep economic growth strong , " he said . however , germany - and other members of the european union - are having to come to each other 's aid in a joint effort to protect the euro , shared by 16 of the eu 's members .
merkel has said that the billions the german government had already agreed to were in the greater interest of the euro currency , not individual member states . merkel also said that the european union would push again for a global financial transaction tax at the g20 meeting . germany and france support the introduction of the tax in europe but g20 hosts canada as well as britain are opposed to it . " there will certainly be controversial discussions about this but i am happy the european council reached a common stance on this for the g20 meeting , " merkel said . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 19.06.2010 german teachers to get guidelines on dealing with forced marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced marriage is getting increased attention in germany forced marriages shock most germans , but they still happen .
now the government has published a set of guidelines to help teachers identify and deal with cases where their students might be married off against their will . last month a 15-year-old girl from hamburg made headlines when she texted a friend and her teacher saying that she had been taken to berlin against her will and was being forced into a marriage by her serbian family .
the authorities were alerted and the youth welfare office intervened .
the girl recanted her story , however , and was returned to her family .
in an e-mail quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , her classmates contend she only changed the story under pressure from her parents .
if it were n't for her teacher , the world may never have known this girl 's story .
guidelines for dealing with ' abuse of human rights ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the guidelines will give teachers the right tools to deal with forced marriage recently the german government 's integration commissioner released a set of guidelines for schools dealing with potential cases of forced marriage .
" forced marriage is an abuse of human rights , " said commissioner maria boehmer .
" current mechanisms for helping young men and women threatened by forced marriage often come too late or not at all .
schools can play an important role here . "
one section of the guidelines , which will soon be made available to every school in the country , is a list of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women threatened by a forced marriage .
one of those groups is papatya , a crisis and transition center for girls with immigrant backgrounds .
the director of the center told deutsche welle she thinks focusing on schools is crucial , because most of those threatened by forced marriage are between the ages of 14 and 20 and attend school .
" school is the only place where they 're allowed to go by their families .
that means it 's also the only place where they can get help , " she said .
" that 's why it 's so important that teachers are prepared for this issue , so they can give these girls the appropriate advice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers often have the first contact with at-risk young people taking a proactive approach the guidelines encourage teachers to have discussions about relationships and gender roles in class , to talk about human rights in social studies and about one 's right to choose when it comes to sex and marriage during sex education .
for sibylle schreiber of the women 's rights organization terre des femmes , which helped put the guidelines together , the key is to take a proactive approach .
" that means for the teachers to talk about how i will find a partner , would i like to marry or not and how does it work , " schreiber said .
" so first the teacher talks about marriages or partnerships and then slowly they work their way to the topic of forced marriages .
then students who are worried about a possible marriage know their teachers are open to discussing it with them . "
teachers are encouraged to hang up a list included in the guidelines , of agencies and organizations that can help young men or women .
if a student does come to his or her teacher worried about a marriage , the teacher should treat the student 's concerns as credible and connect the student with those who specialize in dealing with the issue .
rooted in patriarchal family structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidelines say teachers and students should talk about their right to choose in the introduction to the guidelines , the authors take pains to make clear that forced marriage is not a problem of one particular religion or culture .
and it can happen to boys as well as girls .
according to the guidelines , there have been cases of asian , african and eastern european families forcing a relative to marry against his or her will .
" in germany , forced marriage is to some extent perceived as problem of people with a turkish migration background .
but forced marriage is not the problem of a particular population group , " the introduction says .
" forced marriage is thus not a question of nationality or religion , but has its roots in patriarchal family structures . "
" a marriage is n't going to be forced on someone who is normally treated with respect , " the director of papatya said .
" it happens in families where girls do n't have a say , where no one listens to what they want , where opposition is n't tolerated and where there is violence .
forced marriage is n't actually a new problem in germany , she said .
her center has been working with girls facing such marriages for 25 years .
what has changed , she said , is the level of awareness .
the girls who arrive at her center looking for help are speaking out more and more against unwanted marriages .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .

romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .

well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .

performances have been staged all over the world , including an adaptation in yemen . at a bus and taxi station in the center of aden , an old woman fights with a drunken thief until a security officer intervenes .
then a street sweeper gets mixed up in the scuffle , while two boys cutting class try to scrounge up money for a round of gambling .
on the edge of it all , a girl stands with a little suitcase in hand , not knowing where to turn .
" a show , a drama , a musical about living and surviving in the big city , about hope and adaptation , courage and self-deceit , to laugh at and cry about , to dream - and to reflect on ourselves . "
that 's how the grips theater bills its " linie 1 , " written by volker ludwig with music by birger heymann .
the realistic play follows a young runaway from the countryside , who comes to berlin chasing after a rock star .
but instead of finding her prince , she lingers in the subway where she is able to obverse the tension and diversity of life in the city .
the grips theater in berlin has staged performances of " linie 1 " continuously since 1986 .
many other theaters across the world have followed suit and hosted guest productions , as well as their own versions of the play .
now , the piece will find a new audience in yemen - with a few changes .
the young yemeni director amr jamal said he tweaked the plot to reflect contemporary issues in his country , noting that people want to come to the theater when they see part of themselves and their problems in the performance .
bildunterschrift : director amr jamal adapted the play for a yemeni audience adapted for yemen amr jamal first heard of " linie 1 " by way of guido zebisch , director of the german institute for cooperation and culture in saana .
jamal was immediately intrigued both because he likes musicals and because the piece has such a clear connection to everyday people and problems .
jamal 's production , titled " mak nazl " or " exit please , " takes place in aden , but the subway is replaced by a shared taxi and the girl from the countryside by a young mother , who has already been the victim of what 's referred to as a " tourist marriage . "
according to jamal , her story is common among rural families .
" wealthy men from other countries in the gulf travel to rural yemen , where many poor families live .
they marry girls there for a brief period of time in order to have sex with them without violating their religious beliefs .
but really it 's a kind of prostitution . "
after a few nights together in a hotel , the men disappear , leaving the dishonored women behind .
despite the plot 's serious underpinnings , amr jamal and his theater group have developed the play into a lively story with a lot of situational comedy .
bildunterschrift : a bus ride opens up new perspectives for the play 's protagonist theater comes to life " in yemen , there actually is n't a theater scene , " said zebisch , .
nevertheless , there are still people who want to perform and do .
increasingly , theater groups in yemen are winning audiences , including amr jamal 's troupe " khaaled aden . "
their production of " mak nazl " is financed in part by funds from the german culture weeks yemen event , and so far the show has drawn 11,000 viewers .
women also take the stage in the performance , which is not a given in the predominantly muslim country .
during their visit to berlin , khaaled aden also enthused german audiences with their version of the play .
the actors and actresses danced to catchy songs , and the original play 's ' 80s soundtrack was replaced with southern arabic sounds .
the port city of aden is also reflected in the play 's colorful cast of young apartment-seekers , immigrants from somalia , and parents whose adult children have left for england or the us .
and then there 's the woman in the lead - while searching for the man who abandoned and dishonored her , she discovers a world beyond her village 's borders and a new romance along the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.06.2010 close election expected as polls open in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts predict the vote will be close polls have opened in the presidential election in poland , which was triggered by the death of president lech kaczynski .
the campaign mood was sedate , even with topics like euro adoption and afghanistan up for debate . polls opened on sunday in poland 's presidential election , in a vote which many analysts are already anticipating will end inconclusively , leading to a second round of voting in two weeks .
but a recent opinion poll suggests center-right candidate and acting president bronislaw komorowski could scrape by with 51 percent of the vote , the minimum needed to avoid a run-off against right-wing candidate jaroslaw kaczynski .
the elections are being held early in poland this year after former president lech kaczynski was killed along with 95 others in a plane crash in russia on april 10 .
he was the twin brother of jaroslaw kaczynski , who has vowed to pick up where his brother left off .
as speaker of the parliament , komorowski became acting president after kaczynski 's death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's death thrust the nation into a state of mourning in poland , the president is not just a ceremonial figure .
he may hold less power than the prime minister but can still veto laws .
the country 's next president could play a role in the debate over adopting the euro and when to withdraw the country 's troops from nato 's mission in afghanistan .
komorowski has promised to withdraw polish troops from afghanistan , should he be elected .
he said the death of a polish soldier last weekend was " a signal to polish public opinion that something is not right with this mission . "
divided on the issues both komorowski and kaczynski are conservative catholics , but take a dramatically different approach to the euro and poland 's foreign relationships .
kaczynski , who was prime minster from 2006 to 2007 , could put the breaks on parliament as it takes steps toward the adoption of the euro .
" a win for jaroslaw kaczynski would be political hell , " prime minister donald tusk , of komorowski 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- , said recently .
kaczynski is known for his nationalistic stance , putting up a frosty front both to the european union and to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if komorowski wins , the po will control the office of the prime minister and president poland was the only one of the 27 eu countries that did not experience a recession last year .
but the global downturn has led to a budget deficit of 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the deceased kaczynski had often blocked efforts by the pro-business po party from enacting market reforms and his candidate brother opposes government privatization plans .
so far the po has failed to deliver on promises of raising the retirement age and bringing an end to pension privileges enjoyed by farmers and other groups .
party politicians have so far cited the risk of a presidential veto as a reason not to pursue those issues .
kaczynski 's right-wing law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- is nationalistic , euroskeptic and conservative on moral and social issues but swings left on the economy and favors more state spending .
a changed tone the death of lech kaczynski cast a shadow on the election , compounded by two consecutive waves of flooding that left 24 people dead in recent weeks .
" the politicians are using different words ; the campaigns are not as aggressive as they normally are in poland , " said joachim ciecierski , head of polish public radio 's german service .
" the atmosphere is calm , although you can sense a certain tension in the air because it is an important election . "
there 's also been a shift in the electorate .
before the plane crash , komorowski was seen as a shoo-in for the presidency .
but the death of their president has turned voters to the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has reached out to centrist voters in his campaign " somehow -lsb- komorowski -rsb- had taken this almost for granted , " andrzej krajewski of the civic development forum think tank , told deutsche welle .
" in opinion polls he was far ahead of his contenders , including president kaczynski , and now he 's in a very difficult position .
as acting president he will have to execute presidential power , which includes a lot of nominations and a lot of moves which will be measured against his presidency . "
kaczynski was known for his acerbic remarks but has toned down his rhetoric in this campaign in a bid to woo centrist voters .
" for now , jaroslaw is not obliging -lsb- po -rsb- and is playing the kindly old duffer who wants to use this national tragedy to overcome old animosities and unite the nation , " wrote preston keat of eurasia group , a political risk consultancy , in an analytical note this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.06.2010 estonia is ' most integrated country north of germany ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilves says estonains are " committed " to afghanistan skeptics have said greece 's debt crisis should have made estonia rethink adopting the euro , but estonian president toomas hendrik ilves says it was a natural step in the country 's european integration . at a european union summit on thursday , eu leaders voted to make estonia the latest country to adopt the euro .
the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .
the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

the first thing is , we had a referendum on the treaty that said we would join the euro .
this is what happens when you live in a democracy and so there really is no opt-out for estonia , as opposed to say sweden , which joined the european union before there was a requirement to join the eurozone .
but in general and during the financial crisis in particular , the thing we were most concerned about here was needless , baseless and silly speculation against our own currency .
it became quite clear to us that a small country , no matter how fiscally responsible it is , really is at the mercy of the opinions of bankers , and other people very far away who do n't know anything about us , and that the only way to make sure that we do n't come under speculative pressure is to be part of the eurozone .
so this added to our commitment to join the euro earlier rather than later .
it meant that the government had to bite the bullet .
we cut government expenditures by 20 percent , salaries have plummeted , in the private sector the slowdown in the economy did more or less the same for the rest of the economy , but in the public sector there were dramatic cuts in spending .
none of this makes the government popular , but on the other hand , we are a picture of fiscal rectitude with 7.1 percent debt and one of two countries that has a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
estonia has just been invited to join the organization for economic cooperation and development .
how do you see estonia 's role in the oecd ?
well , we always try to be realistic .
we are a small country .
the nature of small economies is different .
small economies face very different kinds of challenges and have different kinds of solutions than large economies .
in fact , i think within the oecd one of the positive things we bring to the table is actually far greater experience in the computerization of private and public services , which even in western europe is at a fairly primitive level , i would say , compared to where estonia is . ninety-nine percent of all estonian tax returns are filed electronically .
all of our public documents are available on the internet .
we think that the european union would do well to move away from paper and go digital because it 's all much more transparent that way .
cyber warfare is a serious issue , and one of the most difficult issues that you mentioned in your keynote address is the gap between what the computer experts understand and what the politicians , who have to make policy , understand .
how do you bridge that gap ?
that understanding , that familiarity with computers , is something we associate with people under 30 .
like my son who is amazingly adept at anything related to computers , and is also not a computer person , but is simply adept .
but for people my age , in their late 50s , using computers is fairly rare , and especially in europe , even more so than in the united states .
i mean yes , everyone has a computer which they use to look at their e-mail , but in terms of what is possible to do , what are the vulnerabilities , these issues are not realized by very many people who are still in leadership positions in european countries .
again , the resistance to computerization that we see in the european commission , the resistance to putting all documents online shows this utter reliance on paper is simply a symptom of a larger lack of understanding of where the world is .
which is fine , but it 's not excusable when we live in a world in which all of our critical infrastructure is now controlled via the internet .
one leading european politician i know does n't even have a computer on his desk but has his secretary print out his emails and then he reads them on paper .
so we have problems .
estonian troops are serving with nato in afghanistan .
is estonia committed there for the long run ?
public opinion in estonia has remained committed .
and so i think estonia will remain committed .
our understanding of it boils down to this : if we allow the threats that emanate from afghanistan to accomplish their goals , if they actually use a weapon of mass destruction on a nato or european member or capital city or something analogous , well then nato is going to be in much more serious trouble than it is today .
if we want to maintain collective defense , then we have to do this collectively .
and i am sad that not all countries in europe understand this , because it really is a collective burden .
we 're in there with no caveats in helmand , one of the nastiest places in afghanistan .
other countries simply pull out .
they 're still with nato .
that 's the hard part to explain .
the difficulty of afghanistan is not the issue for the public .
for the public , the issue is why are they -lsb- other countries -rsb- over there pulling out .

the eu-dominated ohr is responsible for implementing the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war . raffi gregorian , the ohr 's principle deputy , has expressed concern about security companies in republika srpska , the serb-dominated entity of bosnia and herzegovina .
he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

the tiny baltic country has been praised for its fiscal discipline , and remains one of very few nations in the eu to be in compliance with the bloc 's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
deutsche welle spoke with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves about his country 's integration into europe , its modernization efforts and its involvement in the nato mission in afghanistan .
dw : estonia has just been invited to join the eurozone .
has this been a long time coming ?
toomas hendrik ilves : it 's been a long time coming in the sense that one of the goals we 've been working towards basically since we became independent again , was to rejoin europe in all of its various institutions , and actually the euro is the last thing we had yet to join .
we 're in the european union , nato , the schengen area , but with this step , which will officially begin on the january 1 , 2011 , i would argue we are the most integrated country north of germany .
talking to people on the streets , there seems to be some mixed feelings among the population .
some people are excited about joining the currency union , others are worried .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .
" after the wars , these links have endured and are still causing great harm to the quality of governance in the region . " read more about corruption in the balkans 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said those companies belonged to the support network of fugitive war crimes suspect ratko mladic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic has yet to be captured the bosnian serb military leader is being sought by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on charges of genocide in the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and the 43-month siege of sarajevo .
the eu has made his arrest a key condition for further progress in joining the bloc . in june 2009 , gregorian banned four bosnian serb private security companies from operating in brcko , an autonomous region that spans the boundary between republika srpska and bosnia .
the ban was issued after eufor , the european military force in bosnia , and the eu 's police mission in bosnia -lrb- eupm -rrb- rejected requests to regulate the country 's private security industry and crackdown on dubious companies .
eufor and eupm reportedly argued that private security was either a local issue or did not fall within their mandate . " this is a glaring omission , " a well-placed source in sarajevo said .
" the eu is not interested at all .
they are not pushing it . " eufor spokesman bruce foster was evasive on the ohr concerns .
but he told deutsche welle eufor had " a very clear un mandate to contribute to the safe and secure environment for all of the people of bosnia and herzegovina . "
the force monitored " any activity " which could threaten this , foster said . eupm spokeswoman sladjana lizdek said the european police mission was monitoring and advising the police in bosnia and herzegovina to support the fight against organized crime and corruption . " the mission has established that the regulation of the private security sector needs to be enhanced and legislation harmonized across cantons , entities and the state , " lizdek told deutsche welle . before gregorian banned the companies , ohr unsuccessfully urged republika srpska 's prime minister milorad dodik to crack down on the company alpha security .
it was founded by former mladic bodyguard velibor sota .
ohr said alpha employed members of a bosnian serb military unit disbanded by nato in 2003 .
it constituted a " clear and present danger … to the rule of law . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik 's separatist tendencies are considered a threat to peace in the region dodik has granted alpha contracts for the security of state-owned entities , such as the banja luka tobacco factory .
local newspaper reports said that dodik 's support of alpha was part of an effort to create his own counter-intelligence and security service independent of that of bosnia and herzegovina .
well-placed sources said western officials were concerned that dodik was preparing to unilaterally declare republika srpska independent of bosnia . but the power of security companies in serbia was also great .
occrp said serbia is the potential eu candidate with the least regulation of the security sector .
an estimated 60,000 privately employed security personnel operate in serbia .
this trend began in the early 1990s through serbia 's most notorious paramilitary leader zeljko raznatovic , widely known as arkan .
at that time , he founded a security company that trafficked drugs , ran casinos and arranged assassinations . can global players help clean up ? analysts hope that acquisitions by international firms may help clean up the security sector .
so far , global players like prosegur , securitas and g4s have focused on romania , where they together hold a 50 percent market share .
g4s has also acquired a major serb security company . " romania is the test case , " one analyst said .
nevertheless , analysts concede that corruption and close ties between local firms , law enforcement and politicians have effectively excluded foreign companies from winning government contracts . " the reason is simple , " one analyst said .

international groups warn that the eu should be cautious about letting balkan countries into the bloc too quickly . organized crime has infiltrated southeastern europe , particularly bosnia and herzegovina and serbia , and corrupted legitimate business in the region , according to a regional network of investigative journalists .
the sarajevo-based organized crime and corruption reporting project -lrb- occrp -rrb- said this development put into question the ability and willingness of the region 's governments to combat crime and detain war criminals . it also cast doubt on whether the european union will make the crackdown on corruption a key demand for these countries ' eligibility for membership in the bloc . " the eu will keep making demands and eastern european countries will keep saying what the eu wants to hear - and do nothing , " occrp 's drew sullivan told deutsche welle .
" but we all know the eu will let everyone in .
they showed that with romania and bulgaria , two nations still plagued by widespread corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criminal structures have even been able to influence mps in sofia , the report says .
romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 and have subsequently been repeatedly criticized for their slow progress in fighting corruption .
a recent eu-funded report " examining the links between organized crime and corruption " ranks bulgaria alongside italy , poland and romania as the eu 's most corrupt members . " organized crime networks have infiltrated most public institutions -lsb- in bulgaria -rsb- , " the report said .
" this influence in the political and administrative structures allows companies to use corruption to win public tenders , avoid taxes and systematically break laws to gain competitive advantages . " the role of security companies private security firms played a pivotal role in the spread of organized crime in the region , said occrp , which recently concluded a three-month investigation into southeast europe 's private security sector .
security companies maintained ties with organized crime , corrupt politicians and law enforcement elements throughout southeastern europe .
the region 's weak legal infrastructure , lack of enforcement and widespread corruption had facilitated this development . in bulgaria , for example , security agencies constitute the country 's largest private employer with 130,000 employees or one in 11 adult males , according to occrp estimates .
the sector employs three times as many people as the bulgarian military and five times that of the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many former yugoslav army soldiers have joined security firms in the countries of the former yugoslavia , the security sector began growing following the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the subsequent collapse of existing political systems . " trained professional soldiers simply switched to private security companies , protecting banks , schools , money transfers and important people , " the occrp said .
" the work fed their families and gave newly formed governments much needed jobs and security , at least in theory .
in reality , the private security sector became its own political , criminal and social force . " the eu report on corruption blamed the nexus of private security and organized crime on un sanctions imposed in the former yugoslav states during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s . " the fact that smuggling various essential goods , such as oil , was necessary for surviving the un-imposed embargo , and that money from illegal trade was also necessary for financing the waging of war and other state functions , facilitated the involvement of the security services in forging links with organized criminals who could supply the badly needed goods and / or funds , " the report said .

but the country has other partners in the region , and further afield .
syria has been ruled by the assads , father and son , for 40 years in the narrow lanes and covered alleys of the old city of damascus , you can buy fridge magnets showing black and white photos of syria 's first family in the days of its patriarch , president hafez al-assad .
his son bashar inherited the job when he died 10 years ago .
on the magnets you can see bashar and his siblings on their bikes in the early seventies , watched lovingly by their smiling parents .
just like any other happy family - except that dad was an air force general who had seized power in one of the coups that were practically annual events in syria for 20 years after the trauma of the creation of israel in 1948 .
while the kids were having fun on their new bikes , assad senior was redefining the phrase " iron grip " .
central , once more hafez assad was the kind of middle eastern leader about whom people used words like calculating , ruthless , and dominating .
he sent in tanks and artillery to crush a revolt by the muslim brotherhood in the city of hama in 1982 , killing thousands .
he was a formidable negotiator .
the story goes that he made sure the us secretary of state warren christopher was served many glasses of tea during marathon diplomatic talks - but never offered a bathroom break .
bashar assad was a vocal opponent of the us invasion of iraq bashar assad is a very different man .
on the couple of times i have met him he has been friendly , even charming , and answered the questions he has been asked .
he conducts interviews with foreign reporters in a walnut-panelled library in a guest house next to the presidential palace , on a hill overlooking damascus .
apparently a famous japanese architect designed it as a family home back in the 1980s , though the assads have never lived there .
it feels like a small and luxurious middle eastern hotel , lots of marble and mother of pearl inlaid furniture .
ten years after what his father made sure was a smooth succession syria is back at the centre of all of the big issues of war and peace in the region .
and president assad the second has become , like his father , a middle eastern leader who can not be ignored .
troublesome old friends syria under bashar assad is trying to face in all directions at the same time .
perhaps improbably , the policy is working pretty well .
the iran connection puts syria dangerously close to the centre of the growing and dangerous crisis over iran 's nuclear plans countries who want to get closer include russia , france , turkey and diplomatically ambitious brazil .
iran has been an ally since his father 's time .
syria and iran are the main backers of hezbollah , israel 's implacable enemy in lebanon .
the americans want a rapprochement , as long as he drops some of his troublesome old friends in beirut and tehran .
that he says he wo n't do - even though the iran connection puts syria dangerously close to the centre of the growing and dangerous crisis over iran 's nuclear plans .
here in damascus the regime operates on different wavelengths at once as well .
facebook is blocked in syria .
but the first lady has her own page with several thousand friends .
damascus feels much more open than it did in the first president assad 's time .
but human rights campaigners and political dissidents get locked up , as this is still a police state .
secret police a few years ago i went to see a lawyer , a critic of the regime , who had just been released from prison and was heading back there fast .
he had a black eye , given to him by a couple of thugs who had jumped off a motorcycle outside his block of flats and beaten him up , without saying a word .
their fists were doing the talking and he assumed the message was from the secret police .
syria lost the golan heights border region to israel in 1967 half close your eyes and you could have been with a dissident intellectual in eastern europe in the seventies or eighties .
and then there 's israel .
for years , israelis have believed it should be easier to make peace with syria than with the palestinians .
the main reason is that giving back the occupied golan heights to syria would be far less controversial inside israel than giving up the occupied west bank and east jerusalem to the palestinians .
as well as that , the secular syrian regime is seen as pragmatic , as long as the deal is right .
but president assad said in our interview that there was no hope of making peace with the current israeli government , not unless they changed their behaviour .
and there 's another problem .
syrian-israeli peace talks in the last few years have been indirect , mediated by a neighbour - turkey .
and since israeli troops killed nine turks on the gaza flotilla , turkey does n't believe the netanyahu government is serious about peace either .
