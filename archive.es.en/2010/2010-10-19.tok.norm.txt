program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.10.2010 us takes calculated risks with arab arms deals in volatile persian gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us aims to rearm its arab allies in the persian gulf with the threat of iran looming large over the region , the us is boosting the military capabilities of friendly arab states in deals worth billions of dollars .
but the arms sales carry huge risks as well as huge profits . the largest procurement of arms by the persian gulf 's arab states in living memory could destabilize the region , boost the ailing united states ' military-industrial complex and set off new rivalries in the highly competitive world of weapons sales , according to middle east and security experts .
the deals struck between the us , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , oman and kuwait , estimated at $ 122.88 billion -lrb- 88.4 billion euros -rrb- over the next four years , will be among the largest rearmament exercises the persian gulf has ever seen - if and when it is approved by us congress .
the largest component of the proposed gulf deal is the $ 67 billion agreement struck with the saudis which will see boeing restock the oil-rich gulf state 's air force with 85 new f-15 jet fighters while refurbishing 70 existing planes ; lockheed martin will provide upgraded radar and missile defense systems and the us defense industry will pump some $ 30 billion into the saudis ' eastern naval fleet .
in addition , the uae will spend up to $ 40 billion on lockheed martin 's thaad high-altitude missile defense system and join kuwait in upgrading its existing patriot missile batteries .
kuwait will also replace and upgrade its warplanes and command and control systems to the tune of $ 7 billion while oman will spend $ 12 billion to do the same with 18 new f-16 jet fighters and upgrades for another 12 thrown in for good measure .
new security structure designed to reinvigorate arms industry by rearming its allies in the gulf , the us is laying the groundwork for a new security structure in the region which it hopes will provide benefits not just in the short term but for the foreseeable future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been pumping billions into military missions initially , the deals will give the us arms industry the huge shot in the arm it currently needs , replenishing the coffers which have been drained by the global economic crisis and the spiralling costs of supplying us-led military adventures in afghanistan and iraq .
in the long term , by boosting the gulf states ability to protect themselves and by promoting the regional bloc known as the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- which the arab signatories belong to , the us hopes that it will have to spend far less money in the future defending its allies in the gulf .
an increased regional deterrence would reduce the need for expensive troop deployments and ensure the flow of energy exports from the gulf without direct us military involvement .
however , a direct consequence of the us upgrading the armed forces of friendly arab states could be a heightened sense of rivalry and competition in the gulf - which is both a desired effect and a hugely inflammatory risk .
arab states switch from defensive to offensive capability " while the sale of arms and weapons-systems to the gcc states is not new , the significance lies in the fact that the deals include the provision of sophisticated offensive capabilities to the gulf states , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , a gulf expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants gulf states to be militarily self-sufficient " in previous cases these would have been opposed by israel and the us congress , but opposition has been muted in this instance owing to the implicit recognition that the gulf states , and saudi arabia in particular , are being armed to enable them to assert military leadership in the gulf and counter iranian influence . "
while iran may be forced to think twice about flexing its muscles with heavily-armed rivals on its borders , the islamic republic may also feel increasingly threatened to such an extent that it could step up its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons in a bid to protect itself .
this in turn could lead to newly empowered states such as saudi arabia stepping up their own atomic ambitions , sparking a nuclear arms race in the gulf - something the us hopes its conventional weapons deals can negate .
" even if iran has not taken a decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability - and this is still unproven either way - it could spark a proliferation cascade if policymakers in saudi arabia decide that it too must acquire such capability , " ulrichsen said .
gulf power struggles play into the hands of arms dealers the delicate state of power in the gulf makes it a rich environment for nations whose arms industries are hugely important to their economies .
the us deals are likely to rankle with a number of rival weapons suppliers such as france and russia - both of whom have strategic links to the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is among the leading european arms dealers " europeans and americans have long competed for foreign arms contracts in asia and the middle east , " daniel keohane , a senior researcher at the european union institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
" this competition is becoming fiercer since european defense budgets are declining relative to the rest of the world , especially compared with rapidly rising defense spending in east asia and the middle east . "
" the real story here , however , is not a foreign sales arms race between european and american allies , but the actual arms race between countries in the middle east . "
fear of saudi arabia approaching a rival supplier is also a driving force behind washington 's desire to seal the deals .
france , russia , britain and - most worryingly - china are all ready to step in and provide riyadh with the weapons it needs if the us can not .
with not only sales but strategic relations and influence at stake , the us would be losing more than a few billion dollars in profits if the saudi kingdom looked elsewhere .
" arms sales to the gulf states have always provided very attractive and lucrative opportunities to weapons exporters , " said dr. ulrichsen .
" while the majority of the sales have come from us companies , western european , russian and chinese companies have all acquired substantial contracts in recent years . "
" the gulf states have been diversifying their security arrangements lately , signified most visibly by the opening of a french military base in abu dhabi in may 2009 .
this was part of an acceleration of french arms sales to the uae , which already provide almost half of the emirate 's military equipment . "
" france has been energetically attempting to get the uae to purchase its rafale warplanes instead of us-made f16s but a deal worth between $ 5bn and $ 10bn has yet to be concluded , and demonstrates the stakes involved between competing french and american interests . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 19.10.2010 bayern , netherlands may go to court over robben , van bommel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben played through pain at this summer 's world cup bayern munich are depleted by injuries and their bosses blame the netherlands .
germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 19.10.2010 berlin backs away from hochtief intervention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is one of germany 's largest construction companies construction giant hochtief won ’ t receive significant help from the german government in warding off a hostile takeover bid by spanish rival acs .
left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

but washington and the world have reasons for concern about how this will affect iraq . there was satisfaction all around as iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki concluded a trip to iran that saw him meet with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad as well as influential shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr .
al-maliki secured political support that should allow him to break the deadlock that has existed since iraq 's indecisive election on march 7 .
in that vote , al-maliki 's dawa party emerged from that vote as the second-strongest force in iraq 's parliament , one vote behind the iraqi list of al-maliki 's rival ayad allawi .
the iran-based al-sadr 's supporters , though , secured 40 seats in that election .
so with the support of al-sadr , brokered by iran 's leadership , al-maliki now has the inside track on a second term in office .
in return , tehran 's influence in baghdad looks set to rise .
" it was an iranian achievement to bring al-sadr and al-maliki together , considering the personal tension between the two , " udo steinbach , a professor emeritus who is one of germany 's leading middle east experts , told deutsche welle .
others say such a deal was necessary , if not inevitable .
" since this spring , there 's been a political stalemate in iraq , " said henner fuertig , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
" al-maliki 's dealings with iran are an attempt to find a solution that 's acceptable to all the shiite parties . "
it remains unclear when a new government could be formed and what changes might result , but there are trends emerging in iraq 's relationship with iran .
and some of them are disturbing .
growing influence bildunterschrift : al-sadr supporters in iraq have called for the us rto leave the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 had the unwanted consequence , from washington 's perspective , of increasing iran 's clout in that country since both nations have a shiite majority .
" since the fall of saddam hussein , iranian influence in iraq has been growing , " fuertig told deutsche welle .
" iran is , after the us , the most influential foreign country in iraq , so we ca n't talk about a fully new development . "
but that does not mean that tehran can call all the shots in baghdad .
" iran 's room to maneuver is not unlimited , " steinbach said .
" iran ca n't allow the impression to arise that it is playing kingmaker in baghdad , and a confessionalist shiite government would attract the ire of iraq 's leading clergymen , who tend to be apolitical . "
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamanei used the occasion of al-maliki 's visit to repeat calls for the us to leave iraq .
and what 's perhaps more troublesome for washington is that the iran-brokered deal is n't likely to go down well with minority sunnis in iraq .
this could reignite the flames of sectarian violence .
militia desertions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni militias are increasingly disgruntled on monday , the afp news agency reported that large numbers of the sunni arab militias , which have been credited for helping ease the violence in iraq in recent years , were turning away from the government and going back to al-qaeda .
" i estimate 15 percent of the 14,500 sahwa -lrb- awakening -rrb- fighters in diyala have rallied to al-qaeda , " the militia 's commander for the province 's western sector , khalil al-karkhi , told afp .
that sentiment was echoed by other iraqi militia commanders .
and german experts concur that the danger of a renewed civil war in iraq is very real .
" the us has always been able to deal well with al-maliki , in part because he 's such a calculable politician , " said fuertig .
" the problem would be , if the sunni minority were driven underground and sunni fighters began cooperating once again with al-qaeda . "
others say that is what , in fact , is already taking place .
" the long interval between the election and the formation of a new government , together with perception of al-maliki as iran 's man and someone who is desperate to hold on to power , has led to a renewed flaring up of violence , " steinbach said .
that 's not a welcome scenario in washington , especially as the us prepares to pull out its military forces from iraq by the end of 2011 .
impotent america ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces are gradually leaving iraq the united states government has tried to downplay the significance of al-maliki 's visit .
" we understand that iran and iraq are neighbors , " us state department spokesman pj crowley told reporters on monday .
" they have to have a relationship .
but we certainly think that iran can be a better neighbor by respecting iraqi sovereignty and ending its support to those who use violence in iraq . "
but others say the us has no choice other than to take a relaxed attitude to iraq 's dealings with one of america 's foremost enemies .
" america no longer has that much influence - they 're almost powerless on iran questions , " steinbach said .
" the fact that al-maliki would turn for help to tehran instead of to a us ally like saudi arabia speaks volumes about the vacuum the us has left behind as a power broker . "
and the experts do n't see many positive scenarios for the future .
" it does n't take much of a fantasy to imagine that there will be fresh unrest and new tensions if the minority sunnis feel they 're being increasingly marginalized , " fuertig said .
in the short term , october 18 , 2010 may be known as the day on which al-maliki , with iranian help , broke through a crippling political stalemate .
but in the long term , it could also go down in history as the day on which the disagreements between iraq 's shiites and sunnis were fatally reinflamed .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .

wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .

he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .
however the rules have been broken regularly .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .
however the rules have been broken regularly .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .

wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .

while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .

" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2010 eu finance ministers rein in hedge funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only hedge funds with a license will be able to enter the market hedge funds operating in europe will need to obtain a special license in order to be traded in eu markets .
the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.10.2010 children 's books for muslims in german could foster integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company aims to publish bilingual books children 's books about christianity abound in german , but muslim children in germany have a tough time finding books about their own religion .
a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

on september 19 , 2010 , the director general of germany ’ s international broadcaster , erik bettermann , signed an agreement to this effect in the egyptian capital .
at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .
both institutions also collaborate in radio broadcasts and further education . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .

the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .
" how much further -lsb- our human ancestors were -rsb- taking it , i do n't think we really know .
but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "

in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .
" how much further -lsb- our human ancestors were -rsb- taking it , i do n't think we really know .
but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "
largo and her colleagues made a bread mixture from ground grains and water , which they cooked over the same kind of hot stone early man , or in this case , perhaps women , would have used .
" it was n't very nice , " she said .
" but tastes have changed . "

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .
however the rules have been broken regularly .

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .
" i believe it is a mistake to maintain that a whole group is unable and unwilling to integrate , " wulff told the turkish newspaper hurriyet 's tuesday edition .
seizing opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's comments follow merkel 's claim that multi-culturalism has failed " it comes down to individuals , " wulff said , adding that the state and society had to offer opportunities to integrate .
" in return , individuals must accept these opportunities .
wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .
although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .
however the rules have been broken regularly .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de archeology -pipe- 19.10.2010 paleolithic humans refined grains in addition to eating meat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers found prehistoric tools the idea that early humans survived on almost nothing but meat has been called into question by a new report looking at the role of plants in the hunter-gatherer diet . a study published on monday in the scientific journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences reports that traces of grains found on 30,000-year-old paleolithic-era grinding stones are proof that early humans did not rely as heavily on meat as a source of energy and nutrition as previously thought .
the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .
" how much further -lsb- our human ancestors were -rsb- taking it , i do n't think we really know .
but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "
largo and her colleagues made a bread mixture from ground grains and water , which they cooked over the same kind of hot stone early man , or in this case , perhaps women , would have used .
" it was n't very nice , " she said .
" but tastes have changed . "

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

on september 19 , 2010 , the director general of germany ’ s international broadcaster , erik bettermann , signed an agreement to this effect in the egyptian capital .
at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .

the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

" potential conflicts can cause numerous problems to all the great powers and demands for military intervention are costly and politically dangerous .
humanitarian aid is expensive and the tragedy of conflict is something none of the great powers wish to observe .
the issue of displaced persons also becomes an issue for the three powers .
finally , conflicts can spread and create instability within their borders , something all wish to avoid . " pirt believes that the combination of the three powers could have a positive effect on unstable regions , with each bringing its own expertise and knowledge to the table . " turkey and russia have linguistic connections with ethnic groups throughout the former soviet union , " he said .
" for example , the ongoing crisis in the kyrgyz republic needs and could benefit from russian and turkish diplomatic intervention . " " the european union is still needed to finance long-term projects that can promote understanding between parties to various conflicts .
it is also clear that all the powers need to discuss financing long term development projects organized by ngos to improve education , employment , socio-economic problems and democratic practices . " no quick fix for the problems on eu 's eastern doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any alliance will face the same problems as if faced alone however , even if the three-way dialogue becomes a reality , the eu , russia and turkey will still face incredible difficulties in resolving the conflicts in restive regions throughout their common neighborhood . " resolution of these conflicts will only come about when the parties involved really want this to happen , no matter how much pressure is imposed on them , " said pirt .
" sanctions do not work as only the population suffers and not the leadership . " " dealing with security issues like these takes decades rather than months , " he concluded .
" unless the alliance manages to agree a united framework on how to deal with the security issues , any attempts at dealing with the issues will end in failure .

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "

germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .

under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .
however the rules have been broken regularly .

although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .

the president also used the newspaper interview to address the issue of turkish entry to the european union .
he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .
germany has some four million muslims among its 82 million inhabitants , with some 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority in the country .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .
both institutions also collaborate in radio broadcasts and further education . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...
let 's keep this peaceful , " he said .

the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .

the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 19.10.2010 think tank report urges eu to reconsider chosen security strategies 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report suggests a different triumverate on eu security pan-european security cooperation tops the agenda at the deauville summit between the leaders of germany , france and russia but while the topic is a pressing one , are they the right people to be talking about it ? german chancellor angela merkel is attending the annual two-day deauville summit which started monday to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy and russian president dmitry medvedev on how security cooperation between the three nations can be improved .
the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on september 19 , 2010 , the director general of germany ’ s international broadcaster , erik bettermann , signed an agreement to this effect in the egyptian capital .
at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .
both institutions also collaborate in radio broadcasts and further education . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.10.2010 us takes calculated risks with arab arms deals in volatile persian gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us aims to rearm its arab allies in the persian gulf with the threat of iran looming large over the region , the us is boosting the military capabilities of friendly arab states in deals worth billions of dollars .
but the arms sales carry huge risks as well as huge profits . the largest procurement of arms by the persian gulf 's arab states in living memory could destabilize the region , boost the ailing united states ' military-industrial complex and set off new rivalries in the highly competitive world of weapons sales , according to middle east and security experts .
the deals struck between the us , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , oman and kuwait , estimated at $ 122.88 billion -lrb- 88.4 billion euros -rrb- over the next four years , will be among the largest rearmament exercises the persian gulf has ever seen - if and when it is approved by us congress .
the largest component of the proposed gulf deal is the $ 67 billion agreement struck with the saudis which will see boeing restock the oil-rich gulf state 's air force with 85 new f-15 jet fighters while refurbishing 70 existing planes ; lockheed martin will provide upgraded radar and missile defense systems and the us defense industry will pump some $ 30 billion into the saudis ' eastern naval fleet .
in addition , the uae will spend up to $ 40 billion on lockheed martin 's thaad high-altitude missile defense system and join kuwait in upgrading its existing patriot missile batteries .
kuwait will also replace and upgrade its warplanes and command and control systems to the tune of $ 7 billion while oman will spend $ 12 billion to do the same with 18 new f-16 jet fighters and upgrades for another 12 thrown in for good measure .
new security structure designed to reinvigorate arms industry by rearming its allies in the gulf , the us is laying the groundwork for a new security structure in the region which it hopes will provide benefits not just in the short term but for the foreseeable future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been pumping billions into military missions initially , the deals will give the us arms industry the huge shot in the arm it currently needs , replenishing the coffers which have been drained by the global economic crisis and the spiralling costs of supplying us-led military adventures in afghanistan and iraq .
in the long term , by boosting the gulf states ability to protect themselves and by promoting the regional bloc known as the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- which the arab signatories belong to , the us hopes that it will have to spend far less money in the future defending its allies in the gulf .
an increased regional deterrence would reduce the need for expensive troop deployments and ensure the flow of energy exports from the gulf without direct us military involvement .
however , a direct consequence of the us upgrading the armed forces of friendly arab states could be a heightened sense of rivalry and competition in the gulf - which is both a desired effect and a hugely inflammatory risk .
arab states switch from defensive to offensive capability " while the sale of arms and weapons-systems to the gcc states is not new , the significance lies in the fact that the deals include the provision of sophisticated offensive capabilities to the gulf states , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , a gulf expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants gulf states to be militarily self-sufficient " in previous cases these would have been opposed by israel and the us congress , but opposition has been muted in this instance owing to the implicit recognition that the gulf states , and saudi arabia in particular , are being armed to enable them to assert military leadership in the gulf and counter iranian influence . "
while iran may be forced to think twice about flexing its muscles with heavily-armed rivals on its borders , the islamic republic may also feel increasingly threatened to such an extent that it could step up its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons in a bid to protect itself .
this in turn could lead to newly empowered states such as saudi arabia stepping up their own atomic ambitions , sparking a nuclear arms race in the gulf - something the us hopes its conventional weapons deals can negate .
" even if iran has not taken a decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability - and this is still unproven either way - it could spark a proliferation cascade if policymakers in saudi arabia decide that it too must acquire such capability , " ulrichsen said .
gulf power struggles play into the hands of arms dealers the delicate state of power in the gulf makes it a rich environment for nations whose arms industries are hugely important to their economies .
the us deals are likely to rankle with a number of rival weapons suppliers such as france and russia - both of whom have strategic links to the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is among the leading european arms dealers " europeans and americans have long competed for foreign arms contracts in asia and the middle east , " daniel keohane , a senior researcher at the european union institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
" this competition is becoming fiercer since european defense budgets are declining relative to the rest of the world , especially compared with rapidly rising defense spending in east asia and the middle east . "
" the real story here , however , is not a foreign sales arms race between european and american allies , but the actual arms race between countries in the middle east . "
fear of saudi arabia approaching a rival supplier is also a driving force behind washington 's desire to seal the deals .
france , russia , britain and - most worryingly - china are all ready to step in and provide riyadh with the weapons it needs if the us can not .
with not only sales but strategic relations and influence at stake , the us would be losing more than a few billion dollars in profits if the saudi kingdom looked elsewhere .
" arms sales to the gulf states have always provided very attractive and lucrative opportunities to weapons exporters , " said dr. ulrichsen .
" while the majority of the sales have come from us companies , western european , russian and chinese companies have all acquired substantial contracts in recent years . "
" the gulf states have been diversifying their security arrangements lately , signified most visibly by the opening of a french military base in abu dhabi in may 2009 .
this was part of an acceleration of french arms sales to the uae , which already provide almost half of the emirate 's military equipment . "
" france has been energetically attempting to get the uae to purchase its rafale warplanes instead of us-made f16s but a deal worth between $ 5bn and $ 10bn has yet to be concluded , and demonstrates the stakes involved between competing french and american interests . "

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .
" i believe it is a mistake to maintain that a whole group is unable and unwilling to integrate , " wulff told the turkish newspaper hurriyet 's tuesday edition .
seizing opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's comments follow merkel 's claim that multi-culturalism has failed " it comes down to individuals , " wulff said , adding that the state and society had to offer opportunities to integrate .
" in return , individuals must accept these opportunities .
wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .
although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .
bid to calm integration debate at the start of the month , wulff tried to calm the controversy by claiming that - along with christianity and judaism - islam was now also a part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was set to meet turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan his comments sparked reaction from conservative politicians , such as bavarian state premier horst seehofer , who said germany should not accept more immigration from " foreign cultures " such as turkey and arab countries .
the president also used the newspaper interview to address the issue of turkish entry to the european union .
he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .
germany has some four million muslims among its 82 million inhabitants , with some 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority in the country .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 19.10.2010 berlin backs away from hochtief intervention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is one of germany 's largest construction companies construction giant hochtief won ’ t receive significant help from the german government in warding off a hostile takeover bid by spanish rival acs .
left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .

evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .
" how much further -lsb- our human ancestors were -rsb- taking it , i do n't think we really know .
but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "
largo and her colleagues made a bread mixture from ground grains and water , which they cooked over the same kind of hot stone early man , or in this case , perhaps women , would have used .
" it was n't very nice , " she said .
" but tastes have changed . "

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...
let 's keep this peaceful , " he said .
france comes to a standstill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train service has been severely cut across the country with all 12 french oil refineries shut down by strikes and truckers blocking roads , sarkozy has said his cabinet would draw up a plan to stop france from grinding to a halt .
" i will hold a meeting as soon as i return to paris to unblock a certain number of situations , because there are people who want to work and who must not be deprived of petrol , " he said .
the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .
oil giant total said a quarter of its 4,000 service stations had experienced shortages after fuel depot blockades and the week-long strikes at refineries .
around one in five stations nationwide has been hit by shortages , according to a tally by french news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has supported sarkozy 's plans for reform majority of french citizens support the protests unions want to force sarkozy to abandon a bill to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and full retirement from 65 to 67 .
the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...
let 's keep this peaceful , " he said .
france comes to a standstill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train service has been severely cut across the country with all 12 french oil refineries shut down by strikes and truckers blocking roads , sarkozy has said his cabinet would draw up a plan to stop france from grinding to a halt .
" i will hold a meeting as soon as i return to paris to unblock a certain number of situations , because there are people who want to work and who must not be deprived of petrol , " he said .
the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .
oil giant total said a quarter of its 4,000 service stations had experienced shortages after fuel depot blockades and the week-long strikes at refineries .
around one in five stations nationwide has been hit by shortages , according to a tally by french news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has supported sarkozy 's plans for reform majority of french citizens support the protests unions want to force sarkozy to abandon a bill to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and full retirement from 65 to 67 .
the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "

the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .

" resolution of these conflicts will only come about when the parties involved really want this to happen , no matter how much pressure is imposed on them , " said pirt .
" sanctions do not work as only the population suffers and not the leadership . " " dealing with security issues like these takes decades rather than months , " he concluded .

" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .

" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.10.2010 us takes calculated risks with arab arms deals in volatile persian gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us aims to rearm its arab allies in the persian gulf with the threat of iran looming large over the region , the us is boosting the military capabilities of friendly arab states in deals worth billions of dollars .
but the arms sales carry huge risks as well as huge profits . the largest procurement of arms by the persian gulf 's arab states in living memory could destabilize the region , boost the ailing united states ' military-industrial complex and set off new rivalries in the highly competitive world of weapons sales , according to middle east and security experts .
the deals struck between the us , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , oman and kuwait , estimated at $ 122.88 billion -lrb- 88.4 billion euros -rrb- over the next four years , will be among the largest rearmament exercises the persian gulf has ever seen - if and when it is approved by us congress .
the largest component of the proposed gulf deal is the $ 67 billion agreement struck with the saudis which will see boeing restock the oil-rich gulf state 's air force with 85 new f-15 jet fighters while refurbishing 70 existing planes ; lockheed martin will provide upgraded radar and missile defense systems and the us defense industry will pump some $ 30 billion into the saudis ' eastern naval fleet .
in addition , the uae will spend up to $ 40 billion on lockheed martin 's thaad high-altitude missile defense system and join kuwait in upgrading its existing patriot missile batteries .
kuwait will also replace and upgrade its warplanes and command and control systems to the tune of $ 7 billion while oman will spend $ 12 billion to do the same with 18 new f-16 jet fighters and upgrades for another 12 thrown in for good measure .
new security structure designed to reinvigorate arms industry by rearming its allies in the gulf , the us is laying the groundwork for a new security structure in the region which it hopes will provide benefits not just in the short term but for the foreseeable future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been pumping billions into military missions initially , the deals will give the us arms industry the huge shot in the arm it currently needs , replenishing the coffers which have been drained by the global economic crisis and the spiralling costs of supplying us-led military adventures in afghanistan and iraq .
in the long term , by boosting the gulf states ability to protect themselves and by promoting the regional bloc known as the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- which the arab signatories belong to , the us hopes that it will have to spend far less money in the future defending its allies in the gulf .
an increased regional deterrence would reduce the need for expensive troop deployments and ensure the flow of energy exports from the gulf without direct us military involvement .
however , a direct consequence of the us upgrading the armed forces of friendly arab states could be a heightened sense of rivalry and competition in the gulf - which is both a desired effect and a hugely inflammatory risk .
arab states switch from defensive to offensive capability " while the sale of arms and weapons-systems to the gcc states is not new , the significance lies in the fact that the deals include the provision of sophisticated offensive capabilities to the gulf states , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , a gulf expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants gulf states to be militarily self-sufficient " in previous cases these would have been opposed by israel and the us congress , but opposition has been muted in this instance owing to the implicit recognition that the gulf states , and saudi arabia in particular , are being armed to enable them to assert military leadership in the gulf and counter iranian influence . "
while iran may be forced to think twice about flexing its muscles with heavily-armed rivals on its borders , the islamic republic may also feel increasingly threatened to such an extent that it could step up its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons in a bid to protect itself .
this in turn could lead to newly empowered states such as saudi arabia stepping up their own atomic ambitions , sparking a nuclear arms race in the gulf - something the us hopes its conventional weapons deals can negate .
" even if iran has not taken a decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability - and this is still unproven either way - it could spark a proliferation cascade if policymakers in saudi arabia decide that it too must acquire such capability , " ulrichsen said .
gulf power struggles play into the hands of arms dealers the delicate state of power in the gulf makes it a rich environment for nations whose arms industries are hugely important to their economies .
the us deals are likely to rankle with a number of rival weapons suppliers such as france and russia - both of whom have strategic links to the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is among the leading european arms dealers " europeans and americans have long competed for foreign arms contracts in asia and the middle east , " daniel keohane , a senior researcher at the european union institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
" this competition is becoming fiercer since european defense budgets are declining relative to the rest of the world , especially compared with rapidly rising defense spending in east asia and the middle east . "
" the real story here , however , is not a foreign sales arms race between european and american allies , but the actual arms race between countries in the middle east . "
fear of saudi arabia approaching a rival supplier is also a driving force behind washington 's desire to seal the deals .
france , russia , britain and - most worryingly - china are all ready to step in and provide riyadh with the weapons it needs if the us can not .
with not only sales but strategic relations and influence at stake , the us would be losing more than a few billion dollars in profits if the saudi kingdom looked elsewhere .
" arms sales to the gulf states have always provided very attractive and lucrative opportunities to weapons exporters , " said dr. ulrichsen .
" while the majority of the sales have come from us companies , western european , russian and chinese companies have all acquired substantial contracts in recent years . "
" the gulf states have been diversifying their security arrangements lately , signified most visibly by the opening of a french military base in abu dhabi in may 2009 .
this was part of an acceleration of french arms sales to the uae , which already provide almost half of the emirate 's military equipment . "
" france has been energetically attempting to get the uae to purchase its rafale warplanes instead of us-made f16s but a deal worth between $ 5bn and $ 10bn has yet to be concluded , and demonstrates the stakes involved between competing french and american interests . "

the us deals are likely to rankle with a number of rival weapons suppliers such as france and russia - both of whom have strategic links to the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is among the leading european arms dealers " europeans and americans have long competed for foreign arms contracts in asia and the middle east , " daniel keohane , a senior researcher at the european union institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
" this competition is becoming fiercer since european defense budgets are declining relative to the rest of the world , especially compared with rapidly rising defense spending in east asia and the middle east . "
" the real story here , however , is not a foreign sales arms race between european and american allies , but the actual arms race between countries in the middle east . "
fear of saudi arabia approaching a rival supplier is also a driving force behind washington 's desire to seal the deals .
france , russia , britain and - most worryingly - china are all ready to step in and provide riyadh with the weapons it needs if the us can not .
with not only sales but strategic relations and influence at stake , the us would be losing more than a few billion dollars in profits if the saudi kingdom looked elsewhere .
" arms sales to the gulf states have always provided very attractive and lucrative opportunities to weapons exporters , " said dr. ulrichsen .
" while the majority of the sales have come from us companies , western european , russian and chinese companies have all acquired substantial contracts in recent years . "
" the gulf states have been diversifying their security arrangements lately , signified most visibly by the opening of a french military base in abu dhabi in may 2009 .
this was part of an acceleration of french arms sales to the uae , which already provide almost half of the emirate 's military equipment . "
" france has been energetically attempting to get the uae to purchase its rafale warplanes instead of us-made f16s but a deal worth between $ 5bn and $ 10bn has yet to be concluded , and demonstrates the stakes involved between competing french and american interests . "

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "

germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .

wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .
although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .

the president also used the newspaper interview to address the issue of turkish entry to the european union .
he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .
" i believe it is a mistake to maintain that a whole group is unable and unwilling to integrate , " wulff told the turkish newspaper hurriyet 's tuesday edition .
seizing opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's comments follow merkel 's claim that multi-culturalism has failed " it comes down to individuals , " wulff said , adding that the state and society had to offer opportunities to integrate .
" in return , individuals must accept these opportunities .
wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .
although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .
bid to calm integration debate at the start of the month , wulff tried to calm the controversy by claiming that - along with christianity and judaism - islam was now also a part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was set to meet turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan his comments sparked reaction from conservative politicians , such as bavarian state premier horst seehofer , who said germany should not accept more immigration from " foreign cultures " such as turkey and arab countries .
the president also used the newspaper interview to address the issue of turkish entry to the european union .
he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .
germany has some four million muslims among its 82 million inhabitants , with some 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority in the country .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .

officials had denied the first-time director shooting rights after protests from women 's groups . the culture minister of bosnia 's muslim-croat federation , gavrilo grahovac , has reviewed the script for angelina jolie 's new film and authorized her crew to film in bosnia , his ministry said .
it had withdrawn permission last week , citing incomplete paperwork as the reason for the ban .
however , the denial had followed on the heels of a meeting between minister grahovac and a women 's activist group , which had criticized the film 's plot as " unacceptable . "
setting things straight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jolie , shown here in iraq , is also a goodwill ambassador for the united nations sarajevo media had reported that the film would tell the story of a muslim rape victim who falls in love with her serb soldier rapist .
jolie denied the reports , with her production staff reissuing the original script to the ministry for review .
jolie later said the movie was intended to remind people of what happened during the 1992-95 bosnian war , which left some 100,000 people dead .
rape was systematically practiced , with bosniak women making up the majority of victims . filming has already begun in hungary and the crew is scheduled to relocate to bosnia in november , with scenes originally set in sarajevo and the central town of zenica .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 19.10.2010 berlin backs away from hochtief intervention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is one of germany 's largest construction companies construction giant hochtief won ’ t receive significant help from the german government in warding off a hostile takeover bid by spanish rival acs .
left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

but washington and the world have reasons for concern about how this will affect iraq . there was satisfaction all around as iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki concluded a trip to iran that saw him meet with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad as well as influential shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr .
al-maliki secured political support that should allow him to break the deadlock that has existed since iraq 's indecisive election on march 7 .
in that vote , al-maliki 's dawa party emerged from that vote as the second-strongest force in iraq 's parliament , one vote behind the iraqi list of al-maliki 's rival ayad allawi .
the iran-based al-sadr 's supporters , though , secured 40 seats in that election .
so with the support of al-sadr , brokered by iran 's leadership , al-maliki now has the inside track on a second term in office .
in return , tehran 's influence in baghdad looks set to rise .
" it was an iranian achievement to bring al-sadr and al-maliki together , considering the personal tension between the two , " udo steinbach , a professor emeritus who is one of germany 's leading middle east experts , told deutsche welle .
others say such a deal was necessary , if not inevitable .
" since this spring , there 's been a political stalemate in iraq , " said henner fuertig , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
" al-maliki 's dealings with iran are an attempt to find a solution that 's acceptable to all the shiite parties . "
it remains unclear when a new government could be formed and what changes might result , but there are trends emerging in iraq 's relationship with iran .
and some of them are disturbing .
growing influence bildunterschrift : al-sadr supporters in iraq have called for the us rto leave the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 had the unwanted consequence , from washington 's perspective , of increasing iran 's clout in that country since both nations have a shiite majority .
" since the fall of saddam hussein , iranian influence in iraq has been growing , " fuertig told deutsche welle .
" iran is , after the us , the most influential foreign country in iraq , so we ca n't talk about a fully new development . "
but that does not mean that tehran can call all the shots in baghdad .
" iran 's room to maneuver is not unlimited , " steinbach said .
" iran ca n't allow the impression to arise that it is playing kingmaker in baghdad , and a confessionalist shiite government would attract the ire of iraq 's leading clergymen , who tend to be apolitical . "
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamanei used the occasion of al-maliki 's visit to repeat calls for the us to leave iraq .
and what 's perhaps more troublesome for washington is that the iran-brokered deal is n't likely to go down well with minority sunnis in iraq .
this could reignite the flames of sectarian violence .
militia desertions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni militias are increasingly disgruntled on monday , the afp news agency reported that large numbers of the sunni arab militias , which have been credited for helping ease the violence in iraq in recent years , were turning away from the government and going back to al-qaeda .
" i estimate 15 percent of the 14,500 sahwa -lrb- awakening -rrb- fighters in diyala have rallied to al-qaeda , " the militia 's commander for the province 's western sector , khalil al-karkhi , told afp .
that sentiment was echoed by other iraqi militia commanders .
and german experts concur that the danger of a renewed civil war in iraq is very real .
" the us has always been able to deal well with al-maliki , in part because he 's such a calculable politician , " said fuertig .
" the problem would be , if the sunni minority were driven underground and sunni fighters began cooperating once again with al-qaeda . "
others say that is what , in fact , is already taking place .
" the long interval between the election and the formation of a new government , together with perception of al-maliki as iran 's man and someone who is desperate to hold on to power , has led to a renewed flaring up of violence , " steinbach said .
that 's not a welcome scenario in washington , especially as the us prepares to pull out its military forces from iraq by the end of 2011 .
impotent america ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces are gradually leaving iraq the united states government has tried to downplay the significance of al-maliki 's visit .
" we understand that iran and iraq are neighbors , " us state department spokesman pj crowley told reporters on monday .
" they have to have a relationship .
but we certainly think that iran can be a better neighbor by respecting iraqi sovereignty and ending its support to those who use violence in iraq . "
but others say the us has no choice other than to take a relaxed attitude to iraq 's dealings with one of america 's foremost enemies .
" america no longer has that much influence - they 're almost powerless on iran questions , " steinbach said .
" the fact that al-maliki would turn for help to tehran instead of to a us ally like saudi arabia speaks volumes about the vacuum the us has left behind as a power broker . "
and the experts do n't see many positive scenarios for the future .
" it does n't take much of a fantasy to imagine that there will be fresh unrest and new tensions if the minority sunnis feel they 're being increasingly marginalized , " fuertig said .
in the short term , october 18 , 2010 may be known as the day on which al-maliki , with iranian help , broke through a crippling political stalemate .
but in the long term , it could also go down in history as the day on which the disagreements between iraq 's shiites and sunnis were fatally reinflamed .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.10.2010 children 's books for muslims in german could foster integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company aims to publish bilingual books children 's books about christianity abound in german , but muslim children in germany have a tough time finding books about their own religion .
a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .

" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .

on september 19 , 2010 , the director general of germany ’ s international broadcaster , erik bettermann , signed an agreement to this effect in the egyptian capital .
at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .
both institutions also collaborate in radio broadcasts and further education . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...

" i will hold a meeting as soon as i return to paris to unblock a certain number of situations , because there are people who want to work and who must not be deprived of petrol , " he said .
the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .

the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...
let 's keep this peaceful , " he said .
france comes to a standstill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train service has been severely cut across the country with all 12 french oil refineries shut down by strikes and truckers blocking roads , sarkozy has said his cabinet would draw up a plan to stop france from grinding to a halt .
" i will hold a meeting as soon as i return to paris to unblock a certain number of situations , because there are people who want to work and who must not be deprived of petrol , " he said .
the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .
oil giant total said a quarter of its 4,000 service stations had experienced shortages after fuel depot blockades and the week-long strikes at refineries .
around one in five stations nationwide has been hit by shortages , according to a tally by french news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has supported sarkozy 's plans for reform majority of french citizens support the protests unions want to force sarkozy to abandon a bill to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and full retirement from 65 to 67 .
the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2010 eu finance ministers rein in hedge funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only hedge funds with a license will be able to enter the market hedge funds operating in europe will need to obtain a special license in order to be traded in eu markets .
the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues .

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2010 eu finance ministers rein in hedge funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only hedge funds with a license will be able to enter the market hedge funds operating in europe will need to obtain a special license in order to be traded in eu markets .
the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "

germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .

sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .
" i believe it is a mistake to maintain that a whole group is unable and unwilling to integrate , " wulff told the turkish newspaper hurriyet 's tuesday edition .
seizing opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's comments follow merkel 's claim that multi-culturalism has failed " it comes down to individuals , " wulff said , adding that the state and society had to offer opportunities to integrate .
" in return , individuals must accept these opportunities .
wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .

the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2010 eu finance ministers rein in hedge funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only hedge funds with a license will be able to enter the market hedge funds operating in europe will need to obtain a special license in order to be traded in eu markets .
the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.10.2010 us takes calculated risks with arab arms deals in volatile persian gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us aims to rearm its arab allies in the persian gulf with the threat of iran looming large over the region , the us is boosting the military capabilities of friendly arab states in deals worth billions of dollars .
but the arms sales carry huge risks as well as huge profits . the largest procurement of arms by the persian gulf 's arab states in living memory could destabilize the region , boost the ailing united states ' military-industrial complex and set off new rivalries in the highly competitive world of weapons sales , according to middle east and security experts .
the deals struck between the us , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , oman and kuwait , estimated at $ 122.88 billion -lrb- 88.4 billion euros -rrb- over the next four years , will be among the largest rearmament exercises the persian gulf has ever seen - if and when it is approved by us congress .
the largest component of the proposed gulf deal is the $ 67 billion agreement struck with the saudis which will see boeing restock the oil-rich gulf state 's air force with 85 new f-15 jet fighters while refurbishing 70 existing planes ; lockheed martin will provide upgraded radar and missile defense systems and the us defense industry will pump some $ 30 billion into the saudis ' eastern naval fleet .
in addition , the uae will spend up to $ 40 billion on lockheed martin 's thaad high-altitude missile defense system and join kuwait in upgrading its existing patriot missile batteries .
kuwait will also replace and upgrade its warplanes and command and control systems to the tune of $ 7 billion while oman will spend $ 12 billion to do the same with 18 new f-16 jet fighters and upgrades for another 12 thrown in for good measure .
new security structure designed to reinvigorate arms industry by rearming its allies in the gulf , the us is laying the groundwork for a new security structure in the region which it hopes will provide benefits not just in the short term but for the foreseeable future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been pumping billions into military missions initially , the deals will give the us arms industry the huge shot in the arm it currently needs , replenishing the coffers which have been drained by the global economic crisis and the spiralling costs of supplying us-led military adventures in afghanistan and iraq .
in the long term , by boosting the gulf states ability to protect themselves and by promoting the regional bloc known as the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- which the arab signatories belong to , the us hopes that it will have to spend far less money in the future defending its allies in the gulf .
an increased regional deterrence would reduce the need for expensive troop deployments and ensure the flow of energy exports from the gulf without direct us military involvement .
however , a direct consequence of the us upgrading the armed forces of friendly arab states could be a heightened sense of rivalry and competition in the gulf - which is both a desired effect and a hugely inflammatory risk .
arab states switch from defensive to offensive capability " while the sale of arms and weapons-systems to the gcc states is not new , the significance lies in the fact that the deals include the provision of sophisticated offensive capabilities to the gulf states , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , a gulf expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants gulf states to be militarily self-sufficient " in previous cases these would have been opposed by israel and the us congress , but opposition has been muted in this instance owing to the implicit recognition that the gulf states , and saudi arabia in particular , are being armed to enable them to assert military leadership in the gulf and counter iranian influence . "
while iran may be forced to think twice about flexing its muscles with heavily-armed rivals on its borders , the islamic republic may also feel increasingly threatened to such an extent that it could step up its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons in a bid to protect itself .
this in turn could lead to newly empowered states such as saudi arabia stepping up their own atomic ambitions , sparking a nuclear arms race in the gulf - something the us hopes its conventional weapons deals can negate .
" even if iran has not taken a decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability - and this is still unproven either way - it could spark a proliferation cascade if policymakers in saudi arabia decide that it too must acquire such capability , " ulrichsen said .
gulf power struggles play into the hands of arms dealers the delicate state of power in the gulf makes it a rich environment for nations whose arms industries are hugely important to their economies .
the us deals are likely to rankle with a number of rival weapons suppliers such as france and russia - both of whom have strategic links to the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is among the leading european arms dealers " europeans and americans have long competed for foreign arms contracts in asia and the middle east , " daniel keohane , a senior researcher at the european union institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
" this competition is becoming fiercer since european defense budgets are declining relative to the rest of the world , especially compared with rapidly rising defense spending in east asia and the middle east . "
" the real story here , however , is not a foreign sales arms race between european and american allies , but the actual arms race between countries in the middle east . "
fear of saudi arabia approaching a rival supplier is also a driving force behind washington 's desire to seal the deals .
france , russia , britain and - most worryingly - china are all ready to step in and provide riyadh with the weapons it needs if the us can not .
with not only sales but strategic relations and influence at stake , the us would be losing more than a few billion dollars in profits if the saudi kingdom looked elsewhere .
" arms sales to the gulf states have always provided very attractive and lucrative opportunities to weapons exporters , " said dr. ulrichsen .
" while the majority of the sales have come from us companies , western european , russian and chinese companies have all acquired substantial contracts in recent years . "
" the gulf states have been diversifying their security arrangements lately , signified most visibly by the opening of a french military base in abu dhabi in may 2009 .
this was part of an acceleration of french arms sales to the uae , which already provide almost half of the emirate 's military equipment . "
" france has been energetically attempting to get the uae to purchase its rafale warplanes instead of us-made f16s but a deal worth between $ 5bn and $ 10bn has yet to be concluded , and demonstrates the stakes involved between competing french and american interests . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 19.10.2010 berlin backs away from hochtief intervention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is one of germany 's largest construction companies construction giant hochtief won ’ t receive significant help from the german government in warding off a hostile takeover bid by spanish rival acs .
left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de archeology -pipe- 19.10.2010 paleolithic humans refined grains in addition to eating meat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers found prehistoric tools the idea that early humans survived on almost nothing but meat has been called into question by a new report looking at the role of plants in the hunter-gatherer diet . a study published on monday in the scientific journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences reports that traces of grains found on 30,000-year-old paleolithic-era grinding stones are proof that early humans did not rely as heavily on meat as a source of energy and nutrition as previously thought .
the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .
" how much further -lsb- our human ancestors were -rsb- taking it , i do n't think we really know .
but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "
largo and her colleagues made a bread mixture from ground grains and water , which they cooked over the same kind of hot stone early man , or in this case , perhaps women , would have used .
" it was n't very nice , " she said .
" but tastes have changed . "

officials had denied the first-time director shooting rights after protests from women 's groups . the culture minister of bosnia 's muslim-croat federation , gavrilo grahovac , has reviewed the script for angelina jolie 's new film and authorized her crew to film in bosnia , his ministry said .
it had withdrawn permission last week , citing incomplete paperwork as the reason for the ban .
however , the denial had followed on the heels of a meeting between minister grahovac and a women 's activist group , which had criticized the film 's plot as " unacceptable . "
setting things straight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jolie , shown here in iraq , is also a goodwill ambassador for the united nations sarajevo media had reported that the film would tell the story of a muslim rape victim who falls in love with her serb soldier rapist .
jolie denied the reports , with her production staff reissuing the original script to the ministry for review .
jolie later said the movie was intended to remind people of what happened during the 1992-95 bosnian war , which left some 100,000 people dead .
rape was systematically practiced , with bosniak women making up the majority of victims . filming has already begun in hungary and the crew is scheduled to relocate to bosnia in november , with scenes originally set in sarajevo and the central town of zenica .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 19.10.2010 more than one million protest against french pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking public and private-sector workers have been joined by students unions and students have continued their protests in france ahead of a crucial vote on pension reform .
travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...
let 's keep this peaceful , " he said .
france comes to a standstill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train service has been severely cut across the country with all 12 french oil refineries shut down by strikes and truckers blocking roads , sarkozy has said his cabinet would draw up a plan to stop france from grinding to a halt .
" i will hold a meeting as soon as i return to paris to unblock a certain number of situations , because there are people who want to work and who must not be deprived of petrol , " he said .
the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .
oil giant total said a quarter of its 4,000 service stations had experienced shortages after fuel depot blockades and the week-long strikes at refineries .
around one in five stations nationwide has been hit by shortages , according to a tally by french news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has supported sarkozy 's plans for reform majority of french citizens support the protests unions want to force sarkozy to abandon a bill to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and full retirement from 65 to 67 .
the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .

but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "

a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

but washington and the world have reasons for concern about how this will affect iraq . there was satisfaction all around as iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki concluded a trip to iran that saw him meet with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad as well as influential shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr .
al-maliki secured political support that should allow him to break the deadlock that has existed since iraq 's indecisive election on march 7 .
in that vote , al-maliki 's dawa party emerged from that vote as the second-strongest force in iraq 's parliament , one vote behind the iraqi list of al-maliki 's rival ayad allawi .
the iran-based al-sadr 's supporters , though , secured 40 seats in that election .
so with the support of al-sadr , brokered by iran 's leadership , al-maliki now has the inside track on a second term in office .
in return , tehran 's influence in baghdad looks set to rise .
" it was an iranian achievement to bring al-sadr and al-maliki together , considering the personal tension between the two , " udo steinbach , a professor emeritus who is one of germany 's leading middle east experts , told deutsche welle .
others say such a deal was necessary , if not inevitable .
" since this spring , there 's been a political stalemate in iraq , " said henner fuertig , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
" al-maliki 's dealings with iran are an attempt to find a solution that 's acceptable to all the shiite parties . "
it remains unclear when a new government could be formed and what changes might result , but there are trends emerging in iraq 's relationship with iran .
and some of them are disturbing .
growing influence bildunterschrift : al-sadr supporters in iraq have called for the us rto leave the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 had the unwanted consequence , from washington 's perspective , of increasing iran 's clout in that country since both nations have a shiite majority .
" since the fall of saddam hussein , iranian influence in iraq has been growing , " fuertig told deutsche welle .
" iran is , after the us , the most influential foreign country in iraq , so we ca n't talk about a fully new development . "
but that does not mean that tehran can call all the shots in baghdad .
" iran 's room to maneuver is not unlimited , " steinbach said .
" iran ca n't allow the impression to arise that it is playing kingmaker in baghdad , and a confessionalist shiite government would attract the ire of iraq 's leading clergymen , who tend to be apolitical . "
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamanei used the occasion of al-maliki 's visit to repeat calls for the us to leave iraq .
and what 's perhaps more troublesome for washington is that the iran-brokered deal is n't likely to go down well with minority sunnis in iraq .
this could reignite the flames of sectarian violence .
militia desertions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni militias are increasingly disgruntled on monday , the afp news agency reported that large numbers of the sunni arab militias , which have been credited for helping ease the violence in iraq in recent years , were turning away from the government and going back to al-qaeda .
" i estimate 15 percent of the 14,500 sahwa -lrb- awakening -rrb- fighters in diyala have rallied to al-qaeda , " the militia 's commander for the province 's western sector , khalil al-karkhi , told afp .
that sentiment was echoed by other iraqi militia commanders .
and german experts concur that the danger of a renewed civil war in iraq is very real .
" the us has always been able to deal well with al-maliki , in part because he 's such a calculable politician , " said fuertig .
" the problem would be , if the sunni minority were driven underground and sunni fighters began cooperating once again with al-qaeda . "
others say that is what , in fact , is already taking place .
" the long interval between the election and the formation of a new government , together with perception of al-maliki as iran 's man and someone who is desperate to hold on to power , has led to a renewed flaring up of violence , " steinbach said .
that 's not a welcome scenario in washington , especially as the us prepares to pull out its military forces from iraq by the end of 2011 .
impotent america ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces are gradually leaving iraq the united states government has tried to downplay the significance of al-maliki 's visit .
" we understand that iran and iraq are neighbors , " us state department spokesman pj crowley told reporters on monday .
" they have to have a relationship .
but we certainly think that iran can be a better neighbor by respecting iraqi sovereignty and ending its support to those who use violence in iraq . "
but others say the us has no choice other than to take a relaxed attitude to iraq 's dealings with one of america 's foremost enemies .
" america no longer has that much influence - they 're almost powerless on iran questions , " steinbach said .
" the fact that al-maliki would turn for help to tehran instead of to a us ally like saudi arabia speaks volumes about the vacuum the us has left behind as a power broker . "
and the experts do n't see many positive scenarios for the future .
" it does n't take much of a fantasy to imagine that there will be fresh unrest and new tensions if the minority sunnis feel they 're being increasingly marginalized , " fuertig said .
in the short term , october 18 , 2010 may be known as the day on which al-maliki , with iranian help , broke through a crippling political stalemate .
but in the long term , it could also go down in history as the day on which the disagreements between iraq 's shiites and sunnis were fatally reinflamed .

" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .

however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .

the raid was put down by loyal security forces . russian security forces killed several chechen separatist rebels who had tried to attack the parliament building in the chechen capital , grozny , on tuesday morning . fighting had erupted around the parliament after a suicide bomber blew himself up on the grounds of the building , while other insurgents attempted to storm parliament .

security forces loyal to chechen president ramzan kadyrov where able to take the building back shortly afterwards and bring the situation under control . " a special operation to destroy the insurgents has taken place , " kadyrov said , adding that all of the attackers had been killed . according to chechen officials , all of the deputies and other people inside the building were freed .
at least 17 people were injured in the attack . the attack was a major blow to moscow 's claim that stability had returned to the troubled province .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 19.10.2010 spain sues google for wifi data capture while taking street view photographs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view is in operation in over 20 countries while the uk and ireland have cleared google of having inadvertantly collected data over wifi data during street view photography , the california company may face 2.4 million euros in fines in spain . spain 's data protection authority has begun legal proceedings against google for potential privacy violations while taking photos for its street view service .
" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.10.2010 growing iranian influence in iraq creates headache for us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handshakes like these are n't necessarily good news for the rest of the world iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki got what he wanted from his visit to iran - help from shiite parties in securing a second term .
but washington and the world have reasons for concern about how this will affect iraq . there was satisfaction all around as iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki concluded a trip to iran that saw him meet with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad as well as influential shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr .
al-maliki secured political support that should allow him to break the deadlock that has existed since iraq 's indecisive election on march 7 .
in that vote , al-maliki 's dawa party emerged from that vote as the second-strongest force in iraq 's parliament , one vote behind the iraqi list of al-maliki 's rival ayad allawi .
the iran-based al-sadr 's supporters , though , secured 40 seats in that election .
so with the support of al-sadr , brokered by iran 's leadership , al-maliki now has the inside track on a second term in office .
in return , tehran 's influence in baghdad looks set to rise .
" it was an iranian achievement to bring al-sadr and al-maliki together , considering the personal tension between the two , " udo steinbach , a professor emeritus who is one of germany 's leading middle east experts , told deutsche welle .
others say such a deal was necessary , if not inevitable .
" since this spring , there 's been a political stalemate in iraq , " said henner fuertig , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
" al-maliki 's dealings with iran are an attempt to find a solution that 's acceptable to all the shiite parties . "
it remains unclear when a new government could be formed and what changes might result , but there are trends emerging in iraq 's relationship with iran .
and some of them are disturbing .
growing influence bildunterschrift : al-sadr supporters in iraq have called for the us rto leave the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 had the unwanted consequence , from washington 's perspective , of increasing iran 's clout in that country since both nations have a shiite majority .
" since the fall of saddam hussein , iranian influence in iraq has been growing , " fuertig told deutsche welle .
" iran is , after the us , the most influential foreign country in iraq , so we ca n't talk about a fully new development . "
but that does not mean that tehran can call all the shots in baghdad .
" iran 's room to maneuver is not unlimited , " steinbach said .
" iran ca n't allow the impression to arise that it is playing kingmaker in baghdad , and a confessionalist shiite government would attract the ire of iraq 's leading clergymen , who tend to be apolitical . "
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamanei used the occasion of al-maliki 's visit to repeat calls for the us to leave iraq .
and what 's perhaps more troublesome for washington is that the iran-brokered deal is n't likely to go down well with minority sunnis in iraq .
this could reignite the flames of sectarian violence .
militia desertions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni militias are increasingly disgruntled on monday , the afp news agency reported that large numbers of the sunni arab militias , which have been credited for helping ease the violence in iraq in recent years , were turning away from the government and going back to al-qaeda .
" i estimate 15 percent of the 14,500 sahwa -lrb- awakening -rrb- fighters in diyala have rallied to al-qaeda , " the militia 's commander for the province 's western sector , khalil al-karkhi , told afp .
that sentiment was echoed by other iraqi militia commanders .
and german experts concur that the danger of a renewed civil war in iraq is very real .
" the us has always been able to deal well with al-maliki , in part because he 's such a calculable politician , " said fuertig .
" the problem would be , if the sunni minority were driven underground and sunni fighters began cooperating once again with al-qaeda . "
others say that is what , in fact , is already taking place .
" the long interval between the election and the formation of a new government , together with perception of al-maliki as iran 's man and someone who is desperate to hold on to power , has led to a renewed flaring up of violence , " steinbach said .
that 's not a welcome scenario in washington , especially as the us prepares to pull out its military forces from iraq by the end of 2011 .
impotent america ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces are gradually leaving iraq the united states government has tried to downplay the significance of al-maliki 's visit .
" we understand that iran and iraq are neighbors , " us state department spokesman pj crowley told reporters on monday .
" they have to have a relationship .
but we certainly think that iran can be a better neighbor by respecting iraqi sovereignty and ending its support to those who use violence in iraq . "
but others say the us has no choice other than to take a relaxed attitude to iraq 's dealings with one of america 's foremost enemies .
" america no longer has that much influence - they 're almost powerless on iran questions , " steinbach said .
" the fact that al-maliki would turn for help to tehran instead of to a us ally like saudi arabia speaks volumes about the vacuum the us has left behind as a power broker . "
and the experts do n't see many positive scenarios for the future .
" it does n't take much of a fantasy to imagine that there will be fresh unrest and new tensions if the minority sunnis feel they 're being increasingly marginalized , " fuertig said .
in the short term , october 18 , 2010 may be known as the day on which al-maliki , with iranian help , broke through a crippling political stalemate .
but in the long term , it could also go down in history as the day on which the disagreements between iraq 's shiites and sunnis were fatally reinflamed .

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .
however the rules have been broken regularly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 19.10.2010 berlin backs away from hochtief intervention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is one of germany 's largest construction companies construction giant hochtief won ’ t receive significant help from the german government in warding off a hostile takeover bid by spanish rival acs .
left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

but washington and the world have reasons for concern about how this will affect iraq . there was satisfaction all around as iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki concluded a trip to iran that saw him meet with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad as well as influential shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr .
al-maliki secured political support that should allow him to break the deadlock that has existed since iraq 's indecisive election on march 7 .
in that vote , al-maliki 's dawa party emerged from that vote as the second-strongest force in iraq 's parliament , one vote behind the iraqi list of al-maliki 's rival ayad allawi .
the iran-based al-sadr 's supporters , though , secured 40 seats in that election .
so with the support of al-sadr , brokered by iran 's leadership , al-maliki now has the inside track on a second term in office .
in return , tehran 's influence in baghdad looks set to rise .
" it was an iranian achievement to bring al-sadr and al-maliki together , considering the personal tension between the two , " udo steinbach , a professor emeritus who is one of germany 's leading middle east experts , told deutsche welle .
others say such a deal was necessary , if not inevitable .
" since this spring , there 's been a political stalemate in iraq , " said henner fuertig , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
" al-maliki 's dealings with iran are an attempt to find a solution that 's acceptable to all the shiite parties . "
it remains unclear when a new government could be formed and what changes might result , but there are trends emerging in iraq 's relationship with iran .
and some of them are disturbing .
growing influence bildunterschrift : al-sadr supporters in iraq have called for the us rto leave the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 had the unwanted consequence , from washington 's perspective , of increasing iran 's clout in that country since both nations have a shiite majority .
" since the fall of saddam hussein , iranian influence in iraq has been growing , " fuertig told deutsche welle .
" iran is , after the us , the most influential foreign country in iraq , so we ca n't talk about a fully new development . "
but that does not mean that tehran can call all the shots in baghdad .
" iran 's room to maneuver is not unlimited , " steinbach said .
" iran ca n't allow the impression to arise that it is playing kingmaker in baghdad , and a confessionalist shiite government would attract the ire of iraq 's leading clergymen , who tend to be apolitical . "
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamanei used the occasion of al-maliki 's visit to repeat calls for the us to leave iraq .
and what 's perhaps more troublesome for washington is that the iran-brokered deal is n't likely to go down well with minority sunnis in iraq .
this could reignite the flames of sectarian violence .
militia desertions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni militias are increasingly disgruntled on monday , the afp news agency reported that large numbers of the sunni arab militias , which have been credited for helping ease the violence in iraq in recent years , were turning away from the government and going back to al-qaeda .
" i estimate 15 percent of the 14,500 sahwa -lrb- awakening -rrb- fighters in diyala have rallied to al-qaeda , " the militia 's commander for the province 's western sector , khalil al-karkhi , told afp .
that sentiment was echoed by other iraqi militia commanders .
and german experts concur that the danger of a renewed civil war in iraq is very real .
" the us has always been able to deal well with al-maliki , in part because he 's such a calculable politician , " said fuertig .
" the problem would be , if the sunni minority were driven underground and sunni fighters began cooperating once again with al-qaeda . "
others say that is what , in fact , is already taking place .
" the long interval between the election and the formation of a new government , together with perception of al-maliki as iran 's man and someone who is desperate to hold on to power , has led to a renewed flaring up of violence , " steinbach said .
that 's not a welcome scenario in washington , especially as the us prepares to pull out its military forces from iraq by the end of 2011 .
impotent america ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces are gradually leaving iraq the united states government has tried to downplay the significance of al-maliki 's visit .
" we understand that iran and iraq are neighbors , " us state department spokesman pj crowley told reporters on monday .
" they have to have a relationship .
but we certainly think that iran can be a better neighbor by respecting iraqi sovereignty and ending its support to those who use violence in iraq . "
but others say the us has no choice other than to take a relaxed attitude to iraq 's dealings with one of america 's foremost enemies .
" america no longer has that much influence - they 're almost powerless on iran questions , " steinbach said .
" the fact that al-maliki would turn for help to tehran instead of to a us ally like saudi arabia speaks volumes about the vacuum the us has left behind as a power broker . "
and the experts do n't see many positive scenarios for the future .
" it does n't take much of a fantasy to imagine that there will be fresh unrest and new tensions if the minority sunnis feel they 're being increasingly marginalized , " fuertig said .
in the short term , october 18 , 2010 may be known as the day on which al-maliki , with iranian help , broke through a crippling political stalemate .
but in the long term , it could also go down in history as the day on which the disagreements between iraq 's shiites and sunnis were fatally reinflamed .

on september 19 , 2010 , the director general of germany ’ s international broadcaster , erik bettermann , signed an agreement to this effect in the egyptian capital .
at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .
both institutions also collaborate in radio broadcasts and further education . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 02 dw-tv europe live typisch deutsch we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...
let 's keep this peaceful , " he said .
france comes to a standstill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train service has been severely cut across the country with all 12 french oil refineries shut down by strikes and truckers blocking roads , sarkozy has said his cabinet would draw up a plan to stop france from grinding to a halt .
" i will hold a meeting as soon as i return to paris to unblock a certain number of situations , because there are people who want to work and who must not be deprived of petrol , " he said .
the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .
oil giant total said a quarter of its 4,000 service stations had experienced shortages after fuel depot blockades and the week-long strikes at refineries .
around one in five stations nationwide has been hit by shortages , according to a tally by french news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has supported sarkozy 's plans for reform majority of french citizens support the protests unions want to force sarkozy to abandon a bill to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and full retirement from 65 to 67 .
the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2010 eu finance ministers rein in hedge funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only hedge funds with a license will be able to enter the market hedge funds operating in europe will need to obtain a special license in order to be traded in eu markets .
the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

just six minutes later , cluj 's cristian panin put a bayern corner kick into his net for another own goal , giving the bavarians the lead .
although cluj almost scored ahead of half-time through ivory coast forward lacina traore , bayern finished the first half in the lead .
bayern 's mario gomez added to the score line , stabbing a shot past cluj keeper eduard stancioiu on 77 minutes .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .
" i believe it is a mistake to maintain that a whole group is unable and unwilling to integrate , " wulff told the turkish newspaper hurriyet 's tuesday edition .

" in return , individuals must accept these opportunities .
wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .
although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .

the president also used the newspaper interview to address the issue of turkish entry to the european union .
he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .
germany has some four million muslims among its 82 million inhabitants , with some 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.10.2010 children 's books for muslims in german could foster integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company aims to publish bilingual books children 's books about christianity abound in german , but muslim children in germany have a tough time finding books about their own religion .
a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

" potential conflicts can cause numerous problems to all the great powers and demands for military intervention are costly and politically dangerous .
humanitarian aid is expensive and the tragedy of conflict is something none of the great powers wish to observe .
the issue of displaced persons also becomes an issue for the three powers .
finally , conflicts can spread and create instability within their borders , something all wish to avoid . " pirt believes that the combination of the three powers could have a positive effect on unstable regions , with each bringing its own expertise and knowledge to the table . " turkey and russia have linguistic connections with ethnic groups throughout the former soviet union , " he said .
" for example , the ongoing crisis in the kyrgyz republic needs and could benefit from russian and turkish diplomatic intervention . " " the european union is still needed to finance long-term projects that can promote understanding between parties to various conflicts .
it is also clear that all the powers need to discuss financing long term development projects organized by ngos to improve education , employment , socio-economic problems and democratic practices . " no quick fix for the problems on eu 's eastern doorstep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any alliance will face the same problems as if faced alone however , even if the three-way dialogue becomes a reality , the eu , russia and turkey will still face incredible difficulties in resolving the conflicts in restive regions throughout their common neighborhood . " resolution of these conflicts will only come about when the parties involved really want this to happen , no matter how much pressure is imposed on them , " said pirt .
" sanctions do not work as only the population suffers and not the leadership . " " dealing with security issues like these takes decades rather than months , " he concluded .
" unless the alliance manages to agree a united framework on how to deal with the security issues , any attempts at dealing with the issues will end in failure .

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .
" how much further -lsb- our human ancestors were -rsb- taking it , i do n't think we really know .
but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "
largo and her colleagues made a bread mixture from ground grains and water , which they cooked over the same kind of hot stone early man , or in this case , perhaps women , would have used .
" it was n't very nice , " she said .
" but tastes have changed . "

a new publisher is changing that . " integration begins with children , " said islam expert ahmad milad karimi .
it 's a pragmatic view on the subject of integration so hotly debated in germany of late .
karimi can also speak from experience .
born in kabul in 1979 , as a child he fled afghanistan with his parents and settled in germany .
now , with his newly founded publishing house salam verlag , which focuses on religion-oriented childen 's literature , he wants to help muslim children living in germany feel more at home and adapt to life here .
for decades , muslims in this country have cultivated their own communities and associations where they can meet , practice and educate each other about their islamic faith .
but muslim kids need more than that , karimi believes .
no real reading material exists in the islamic communities in germany which promotes children 's self-confidence and their integration into german culture , he noted .
furthermore , illustrated books in regular german pre-schools , for instance , also largely overlook muslim children of migrants who " have a more complex identity than german-germans , " karimi said .
" they can not relate to the children portrayed in the regular books . "
a ' who 's who ' in religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad milad karimi experienced immigration and integration himself karimi wants to close that gap with his publishing company , and its name " salam , " which means " peace " in arabic , is also part of its program .
the books are aimed to playfully educate children about different religions , not just islam , and offer answers to questions like : what is the koran ?
who was mohammed ?
who were moses and jesus ?
the colorful books are also intended to show the diversity of the islamic faith and demonstrate how dialogue with other cultures and belief systems can be cultivated .
for now , salam verlag is publishing in german , but versions in arabic , turkish , farsi , urdu and indonesian are in the pipeline .
it 's a task that normal german schools must also take up , said gabi netz , editor-in-chief of lehrer-online , a portal offering digital educational material and tips to teachers .
" all religions could be taught in schools , not just christianity , so that a sense of community can develop , " netz said .
" the teachers are the ones faced with the challenge of fostering dialogue between german-german children and those with an immigrant background . "
fighting extremism through comics in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , as well as others , islam can be chosen among protestantism , catholicism or philosophy to fulfill the religion requirement in schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one salam verlag book talks about cancer within islamic studies classes , some teachers have chosen to use a comic book called " andi 2 , " written in german by ahmet arslan and duran terzi , " to teach the difference between islamism and islam , " arslan said .
it 's an additional measure in battling right-wing extremism and terrorism by teaching about democracy .
" explaining to kids what certain terms mean , like ' sharia , ' for instance and hearing what they have to say about it - that 's just one example of how such classes work , " arslan explained .
" ' the comic book ' andi 2 ' opens the door to the discussion , and once kids get the feeling their opinion counts , whatever it may be , something else happens : they become more open , and that 's the first step in the democratic process , " he observed .
" and that is a perfect example of successful integration , " he said , pointing out that the teaching materials can also be used in politics , civics and philosophy lessons , as well as religion .
furthermore , " when kids realize that the constitution protects the practice of one 's religion , then they also develop more respect for the constitution itself . "
books of all sizes and color books published by small publishers like the salam verlag also want to encourage children 's self-confidence , not just their ideas about religion .
" fayzal der krebsfaenger " is a delicately illustrated book that is intended to offer courage and support to children with cancer - a difficult topic which the author addresses in a fairy tale-like , yet down-to-earth manner .
" der kleine hassan , " on the other hand , portrays a good , pious little boy who admires flowers and bees and whose mother stays at home , while his father is always ready to answer philosophical questions .
the story is less likely to appeal to the computer and tv-obsessed kids of modern day , muslim or not , but karimi added that " it 's a tough job for authors to explain intercultural references in an understandable way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children need books they can relate to regardless of the approach of the books in the salam verlag 's program , the question remains as to how to motivate children to read them , especially if their parents are not readers themselves ?
karimi , for his part , said it 's a major challenge and it 's not enough to sell the books in bookstores .
he intends to organize events in muslim communities and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods .
it 's " pioneering work , " he noted , but he 's ready to take up the challenge .
a good move , arslan said .
" people should stop all this talk about integration and just get moving .
it 's time to act and create things that promote integration , " he said , referring to books .
netz pragmatically concurred : " ultimately , the market will decide on the product 's appeal and success . "
" besides , so much junk is usually published , why not print something with content and see what happens ? " she added about salam verlag 's current program .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .
" i believe it is a mistake to maintain that a whole group is unable and unwilling to integrate , " wulff told the turkish newspaper hurriyet 's tuesday edition .
seizing opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's comments follow merkel 's claim that multi-culturalism has failed " it comes down to individuals , " wulff said , adding that the state and society had to offer opportunities to integrate .
" in return , individuals must accept these opportunities .
wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .
although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .
bid to calm integration debate at the start of the month , wulff tried to calm the controversy by claiming that - along with christianity and judaism - islam was now also a part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was set to meet turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan his comments sparked reaction from conservative politicians , such as bavarian state premier horst seehofer , who said germany should not accept more immigration from " foreign cultures " such as turkey and arab countries .
the president also used the newspaper interview to address the issue of turkish entry to the european union .
he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .
germany has some four million muslims among its 82 million inhabitants , with some 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de archeology -pipe- 19.10.2010 paleolithic humans refined grains in addition to eating meat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers found prehistoric tools the idea that early humans survived on almost nothing but meat has been called into question by a new report looking at the role of plants in the hunter-gatherer diet . a study published on monday in the scientific journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences reports that traces of grains found on 30,000-year-old paleolithic-era grinding stones are proof that early humans did not rely as heavily on meat as a source of energy and nutrition as previously thought .
the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .
" what we know from this is that they 're grounding up plants and making flour - we did n't find any bread , " trikaus added .
" how much further -lsb- our human ancestors were -rsb- taking it , i do n't think we really know .
but not only is there evidence of this -lsb- in one location -rsb- , but we 're finding it across europe . "
largo and her colleagues made a bread mixture from ground grains and water , which they cooked over the same kind of hot stone early man , or in this case , perhaps women , would have used .
" it was n't very nice , " she said .
" but tastes have changed . "

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 19.10.2010 bayern , netherlands may go to court over robben , van bommel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben played through pain at this summer 's world cup bayern munich are depleted by injuries and their bosses blame the netherlands .
germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...
let 's keep this peaceful , " he said .
france comes to a standstill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train service has been severely cut across the country with all 12 french oil refineries shut down by strikes and truckers blocking roads , sarkozy has said his cabinet would draw up a plan to stop france from grinding to a halt .
" i will hold a meeting as soon as i return to paris to unblock a certain number of situations , because there are people who want to work and who must not be deprived of petrol , " he said .
the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .
oil giant total said a quarter of its 4,000 service stations had experienced shortages after fuel depot blockades and the week-long strikes at refineries .
around one in five stations nationwide has been hit by shortages , according to a tally by french news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has supported sarkozy 's plans for reform majority of french citizens support the protests unions want to force sarkozy to abandon a bill to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and full retirement from 65 to 67 .
the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

at least seven people died when separatist islamist militants tried to storm parliament .
the raid was put down by loyal security forces . russian security forces killed several chechen separatist rebels who had tried to attack the parliament building in the chechen capital , grozny , on tuesday morning . fighting had erupted around the parliament after a suicide bomber blew himself up on the grounds of the building , while other insurgents attempted to storm parliament .
according to russian media reports , at least four people where killed in addition to at least three of the attackers . the militants briefly managed to seize the parliament building and take hostages .
security forces loyal to chechen president ramzan kadyrov where able to take the building back shortly afterwards and bring the situation under control . " a special operation to destroy the insurgents has taken place , " kadyrov said , adding that all of the attackers had been killed . according to chechen officials , all of the deputies and other people inside the building were freed .
at least 17 people were injured in the attack . the attack was a major blow to moscow 's claim that stability had returned to the troubled province .
the volatile region in the russian caucasus has been fighting an islamist separatist insurgency in chechnya and neighboring areas for years . eu condemns the attacks the eu 's chief diplomat , catherine ashton , said she was " appalled by the attack . "
in a statement , she pledged to strengthen cooperation with russia to fight international terrorism . " no circumstances can justify the use of terrorist violence and suicide attacks , " the ashton said . " we confirm our readiness to strengthen cooperation with the russian federation in the fight against international terrorism .

but washington and the world have reasons for concern about how this will affect iraq . there was satisfaction all around as iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki concluded a trip to iran that saw him meet with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad as well as influential shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr .
al-maliki secured political support that should allow him to break the deadlock that has existed since iraq 's indecisive election on march 7 .
in that vote , al-maliki 's dawa party emerged from that vote as the second-strongest force in iraq 's parliament , one vote behind the iraqi list of al-maliki 's rival ayad allawi .
the iran-based al-sadr 's supporters , though , secured 40 seats in that election .
so with the support of al-sadr , brokered by iran 's leadership , al-maliki now has the inside track on a second term in office .
in return , tehran 's influence in baghdad looks set to rise .
" it was an iranian achievement to bring al-sadr and al-maliki together , considering the personal tension between the two , " udo steinbach , a professor emeritus who is one of germany 's leading middle east experts , told deutsche welle .
others say such a deal was necessary , if not inevitable .
" since this spring , there 's been a political stalemate in iraq , " said henner fuertig , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
" al-maliki 's dealings with iran are an attempt to find a solution that 's acceptable to all the shiite parties . "
it remains unclear when a new government could be formed and what changes might result , but there are trends emerging in iraq 's relationship with iran .
and some of them are disturbing .
growing influence bildunterschrift : al-sadr supporters in iraq have called for the us rto leave the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 had the unwanted consequence , from washington 's perspective , of increasing iran 's clout in that country since both nations have a shiite majority .
" since the fall of saddam hussein , iranian influence in iraq has been growing , " fuertig told deutsche welle .
" iran is , after the us , the most influential foreign country in iraq , so we ca n't talk about a fully new development . "
but that does not mean that tehran can call all the shots in baghdad .
" iran 's room to maneuver is not unlimited , " steinbach said .
" iran ca n't allow the impression to arise that it is playing kingmaker in baghdad , and a confessionalist shiite government would attract the ire of iraq 's leading clergymen , who tend to be apolitical . "
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamanei used the occasion of al-maliki 's visit to repeat calls for the us to leave iraq .
and what 's perhaps more troublesome for washington is that the iran-brokered deal is n't likely to go down well with minority sunnis in iraq .
this could reignite the flames of sectarian violence .
militia desertions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni militias are increasingly disgruntled on monday , the afp news agency reported that large numbers of the sunni arab militias , which have been credited for helping ease the violence in iraq in recent years , were turning away from the government and going back to al-qaeda .
" i estimate 15 percent of the 14,500 sahwa -lrb- awakening -rrb- fighters in diyala have rallied to al-qaeda , " the militia 's commander for the province 's western sector , khalil al-karkhi , told afp .
that sentiment was echoed by other iraqi militia commanders .
and german experts concur that the danger of a renewed civil war in iraq is very real .
" the us has always been able to deal well with al-maliki , in part because he 's such a calculable politician , " said fuertig .
" the problem would be , if the sunni minority were driven underground and sunni fighters began cooperating once again with al-qaeda . "
others say that is what , in fact , is already taking place .
" the long interval between the election and the formation of a new government , together with perception of al-maliki as iran 's man and someone who is desperate to hold on to power , has led to a renewed flaring up of violence , " steinbach said .
that 's not a welcome scenario in washington , especially as the us prepares to pull out its military forces from iraq by the end of 2011 .
impotent america ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces are gradually leaving iraq the united states government has tried to downplay the significance of al-maliki 's visit .
" we understand that iran and iraq are neighbors , " us state department spokesman pj crowley told reporters on monday .
" they have to have a relationship .
but we certainly think that iran can be a better neighbor by respecting iraqi sovereignty and ending its support to those who use violence in iraq . "
but others say the us has no choice other than to take a relaxed attitude to iraq 's dealings with one of america 's foremost enemies .
" america no longer has that much influence - they 're almost powerless on iran questions , " steinbach said .
" the fact that al-maliki would turn for help to tehran instead of to a us ally like saudi arabia speaks volumes about the vacuum the us has left behind as a power broker . "
and the experts do n't see many positive scenarios for the future .
" it does n't take much of a fantasy to imagine that there will be fresh unrest and new tensions if the minority sunnis feel they 're being increasingly marginalized , " fuertig said .
in the short term , october 18 , 2010 may be known as the day on which al-maliki , with iranian help , broke through a crippling political stalemate .
but in the long term , it could also go down in history as the day on which the disagreements between iraq 's shiites and sunnis were fatally reinflamed .

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .
“ there were always discussions , but the end effect was that the political establishment did n't get involved .
so from that perspective this is n't really a surprise . ”

travelers are facing major delays as fuel reserves run low . strikes by public sector workers and students continued to cause disruptions across france on tuesday , with sporadic outbursts of violence punctuating the final day before the expected vote in the senate on president nicolas sarkozy 's pension reform bill .
the interior ministry reported that 1.1 million people had demonstrated in cities across the country on tuesday , with 67,000 in paris .
cgt , france 's biggest union , estimated the turnout in paris at 330,000 , and 3.5 million people nationwide .
in the paris suburbs , scorched and overturned cars littered the streets as police used tear gas to break up protesters .
a fire gutted a high school overnight in le mans , in western france , while protesters in the southern city of lyon smashed shop and bank windows and looted shops .
the interior ministry said that 1,158 rioters had been arrested at demonstrations since the start of the week , 163 of them on tuesday morning .
speaking from the seaside town of deauville , where he was meeting with the leaders of russia and germany , sarkozy appealed to demonstrators to show restraint .
" in a democracy , everyone can express themselves but you have to do so without violence or excesses , " sarkozy said .
francois chereque , the head of the cfdt union , also called for non-violent protests ahead of a march in central paris .
" i am making a clear and simple appeal today ...

the government said it has dipped into a 30-day reserve stock held by the oil industry , though said it had not yet tapped into the 60-day strategic fuel reserve it maintains for wartime emergencies .
the international energy agency said france had " sufficient stocks " to deal with the situation . about half of french train services were cut on tuesday , and 30-50 percent of flights were grounded .
however , the paris metro and eurostar services were said to be running on close to a normal schedule .

the government says the reforms are necessary to curb pension deficits and protect france 's credit rating .
following the trilateral summit in deauville , german chancellor angela merkel offered her support for sarkozy 's reforms .
" the truth is , people are living longer , " merkel told broadcaster france 2 .
" and if we want to guarantee a reasonable pension , then the fact that people are living longer must lead to a longer working life . "
the senate is to vote on the bill on wednesday , after which it needs a last vote by a parliamentary committee , where sarkozy 's center-right government enjoys a comfortable majority .
a majority of french people support the protests , with a poll published on monday in the daily le parisien showing 71 percent against the proposed reforms .
unions are demanding negotiations on the pension plan .
they have vowed to carry on with the protests , even if the legislation is passed .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2010 eu finance ministers rein in hedge funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only hedge funds with a license will be able to enter the market hedge funds operating in europe will need to obtain a special license in order to be traded in eu markets .
the strict regulations were made possible after britain and france settled a two-year-old dispute . european finance ministers reached a breakthrough agreement on regulating the hedge funds industry on tuesday .
" the big change is that at european level there was no regulation and no supervision , and now there will be one , " the eu 's market regulation commissioner , michel barnier , said in luxembourg .
the eu is seeking greater transparency from hedge funds .
some argue that hedge funds contributed to the 2008 financial crash due to destabilizing moves on the markets .
mandatory license for access to eu market the new regulations would require each hedge fund to obtain a " passport " in order to have access to the european market .
this license would be issued by the european securities and markets agency -lrb- esma -rrb- , a new eu watchdog based in paris , which is to start work next year .
for around two years , the dispute between britain and france made an agreement impossible .
britain - home to most european hedge funds and foreign-owned funds operating in the eu - fought to ensure that funds based in the commonwealth 's outposts , for instance in the caribbean , but managed in the uk , would be able to sell to all of europe on britain 's regulations alone .
france , on the other hand , wanted stricter rules , with the hedge funds industry regulated by the eu sooner rather than later .
long transitional period as a compromise now , as a compromise , there will be a long transitional period .
if the european parliament votes to approve the proposal next month , the new regulations will likely come into force in january 2011 .
eu member states would then have two years to corporate the new rules into their national legislation . there is an additional three-year-transitional period during which old national authorization procedures for hedge funds would still be valid and co-exist with the new eu regulations .
this means , between 2013 and 2015 , a london-based fund without a esma-issued license would be allowed to sell across europe , although " third-country " funds such as american or cayman island based products would not .
but officials indicated that a new clause allowing the esma to order national regulators to ban those hedge funds that pose a threat to financial stability was instrumental in getting france 's approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter regulations for hedge funds protect consumers , reynders said .
regulated hedge funds to protect consumers belgian finance minister didier reynders who chaired the talks in luxembourg , said the stricter regulations would allow the eu to pressure international partners to match its rules while offering " protection for investments " for consumers .
british financial services secretary mark hoban said that it was a " significant advance from the situation in may , when member states were on the verge of voting through an agreement that would have closed the eu market to funds from third countries . "
german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen expressed delight at the breakthrough .
managers of alternative investment funds had been without supervision on the european scale , whereas germany had already implemented regulations .
he said he was confident that the new regulations would be passed by the european parliament ahead of the g20 summit in november in seoul .

officials had denied the first-time director shooting rights after protests from women 's groups . the culture minister of bosnia 's muslim-croat federation , gavrilo grahovac , has reviewed the script for angelina jolie 's new film and authorized her crew to film in bosnia , his ministry said .
it had withdrawn permission last week , citing incomplete paperwork as the reason for the ban .
however , the denial had followed on the heels of a meeting between minister grahovac and a women 's activist group , which had criticized the film 's plot as " unacceptable . "
setting things straight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jolie , shown here in iraq , is also a goodwill ambassador for the united nations sarajevo media had reported that the film would tell the story of a muslim rape victim who falls in love with her serb soldier rapist .
jolie denied the reports , with her production staff reissuing the original script to the ministry for review .

officials had denied the first-time director shooting rights after protests from women 's groups . the culture minister of bosnia 's muslim-croat federation , gavrilo grahovac , has reviewed the script for angelina jolie 's new film and authorized her crew to film in bosnia , his ministry said .
it had withdrawn permission last week , citing incomplete paperwork as the reason for the ban .
however , the denial had followed on the heels of a meeting between minister grahovac and a women 's activist group , which had criticized the film 's plot as " unacceptable . "

progress was made after germany and france thrashed out a deal of their own . finance ministers struck their deal to strengthen budget rules in an extensive meeting on monday to deliver on promises that the greek debt crisis would never happen again .
eu president herman van rompuy , who led the debate , hailed the results of eight hours of negotiation as " a great step forward in economic governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asmussen said the franco-german deal was necessary for wider progress the agreement followed a deal between france and germany , with paris insisting that over-spenders would be penalized only after a majority of eurozone counties agreed that regulations had been breached .
germany yielded ground on the imposition of automatic penalties after france agreed that changes to the eu 's lisbon treaty - to give the regulations stronger legal status - should remain a possibility .
a treaty change is a long-standing german demand . " a franco-german agreement is necessary to get the whole thing moving along , " german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen said on monday evening .
meanwhile , chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy expressed unity on the matter at a separate meeting in the french resort of deauville .
sarkozy said that more effective measures were needed to deal with countries that breached the rules .
" when a country has an excessive deficit and has not adopted appropriate measures after six months , there must be sanctions , " he said , with merkel adding that a stronger mechanism would be necessary .
" for that , we need changes in the treaty , " said merkel .
no agreement on treaty change however , prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of finance ministers for countries that use the euro as their common currency , said that no agreement on treaty change had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a separate meeting , sarkozy and merkel both spoke of the need for a tougher system he also added that it was " too early to judge " the effectiveness of the overhaul , commenting that details remained to be agreed upon .
under the proposed regime , countries found to have broken the rules would face " quasi-automatic " sanctions – the nature of which has yet to be agreed upon .
however , these sanctions could now be waived with the agreement of a qualified majority of eu states .
the regime would apply to eurozone members at first , and would eventually be extended to all eu states except britain , which retains an opt-out clause .
the political accord is expected to be endorsed by eu leaders at a summit meeting in brussels at the end of october .
the eu 's stability and growth pact states that member states must keep deficits below three per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- with public debt less than 60 per cent of gdp .
however the rules have been broken regularly .

the study also pushes back the earliest known date when humans were processing plant foods by approximately 10,000 years .
the team of researchers working on the project out of the italian institute of prehistory and early history in florence , were alerted to the possibility of prehistoric food processing several years ago when they were studying stone tools found at a site in the megello valley .
having established that the excavated implements had been used to splinter cattails , which once grew in abundance along creeks , they began to wonder what else the plant might have been used for .
evidence found across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belencino in italy 's megello valley was where the first grinding tools were found when the scientists subsequently came across the grinding tools , not only from the italian site , but from southern moravia in the czech republic and the pokrovsky valley in russia as well , they made what laura longo , one of the researchers on the team , told deutsche welle was " an educated guess . "
" we had been hoping the tools were for plant processing , " she said .
" so we did a microanalysis and realized that they had functional areas relating to grinding activity . "
other scientists who were not part of the study celebrated the results of this study .
" this is the time period when we have the first ceramics , the first textiles , we have systematic hunting of animals for furs , " said erik trinkaus , a professor of anthropology at washington university at st. louis in the united states .
" this is one more piece in the puzzle of the real fluorescence of upper paleolithic culture . "
grain identification the next step was to analyze the surface , which they quickly realized was still coated in grains , and to begin the painstaking business of establishing which plants they came from .
in order to do this , they had to build up a reference library of grain shapes , each of which is individual to plant variety .
they mainly came from cattail , a certain fern and a small grass , " longo said , adding that the logical conclusion to draw from that point was that early humans knew how to make a warm meal .
" physiologically speaking carbohydrates need to be cooked in order to be metabolized by our digestive systems . "
that clearly refutes the long-held theory that meat was the only important source of nutrition for the hunter-gatherer .
“ we have finally demonstrated that a part of the diet was based on carbohydrates and plants in general , " longo added .
" it had been assumed for a long time , but it had not been proved before now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making cattail flour the prehistoric way prehistoric woman and that is not all the largely female research team has revealed .
while the general evidence about the distribution of labor in nomadic people is that women stayed at the settlement caring for the children and keeping out of the manly business of hunting and gathering , longo says her team 's findings suggest that women played an active part in the collection and processing of food .
" women had knowledge of what kind of food the nearby surroundings offered , " longo said , " so they were involved . "
likely as not in the cooking process as well .
the italian scientists say the ground grains would have been used for porridges and soups , which would have meant they could be mixed with meat for added nutritional value , but also for flatbreads .

on september 19 , 2010 , the director general of germany ’ s international broadcaster , erik bettermann , signed an agreement to this effect in the egyptian capital .
at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .
both institutions also collaborate in radio broadcasts and further education . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.10.2010 us takes calculated risks with arab arms deals in volatile persian gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us aims to rearm its arab allies in the persian gulf with the threat of iran looming large over the region , the us is boosting the military capabilities of friendly arab states in deals worth billions of dollars .
but the arms sales carry huge risks as well as huge profits . the largest procurement of arms by the persian gulf 's arab states in living memory could destabilize the region , boost the ailing united states ' military-industrial complex and set off new rivalries in the highly competitive world of weapons sales , according to middle east and security experts .
the deals struck between the us , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , oman and kuwait , estimated at $ 122.88 billion -lrb- 88.4 billion euros -rrb- over the next four years , will be among the largest rearmament exercises the persian gulf has ever seen - if and when it is approved by us congress .
the largest component of the proposed gulf deal is the $ 67 billion agreement struck with the saudis which will see boeing restock the oil-rich gulf state 's air force with 85 new f-15 jet fighters while refurbishing 70 existing planes ; lockheed martin will provide upgraded radar and missile defense systems and the us defense industry will pump some $ 30 billion into the saudis ' eastern naval fleet .
in addition , the uae will spend up to $ 40 billion on lockheed martin 's thaad high-altitude missile defense system and join kuwait in upgrading its existing patriot missile batteries .
kuwait will also replace and upgrade its warplanes and command and control systems to the tune of $ 7 billion while oman will spend $ 12 billion to do the same with 18 new f-16 jet fighters and upgrades for another 12 thrown in for good measure .
new security structure designed to reinvigorate arms industry by rearming its allies in the gulf , the us is laying the groundwork for a new security structure in the region which it hopes will provide benefits not just in the short term but for the foreseeable future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been pumping billions into military missions initially , the deals will give the us arms industry the huge shot in the arm it currently needs , replenishing the coffers which have been drained by the global economic crisis and the spiralling costs of supplying us-led military adventures in afghanistan and iraq .
in the long term , by boosting the gulf states ability to protect themselves and by promoting the regional bloc known as the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- which the arab signatories belong to , the us hopes that it will have to spend far less money in the future defending its allies in the gulf .
an increased regional deterrence would reduce the need for expensive troop deployments and ensure the flow of energy exports from the gulf without direct us military involvement .
however , a direct consequence of the us upgrading the armed forces of friendly arab states could be a heightened sense of rivalry and competition in the gulf - which is both a desired effect and a hugely inflammatory risk .
arab states switch from defensive to offensive capability " while the sale of arms and weapons-systems to the gcc states is not new , the significance lies in the fact that the deals include the provision of sophisticated offensive capabilities to the gulf states , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , a gulf expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants gulf states to be militarily self-sufficient " in previous cases these would have been opposed by israel and the us congress , but opposition has been muted in this instance owing to the implicit recognition that the gulf states , and saudi arabia in particular , are being armed to enable them to assert military leadership in the gulf and counter iranian influence . "
while iran may be forced to think twice about flexing its muscles with heavily-armed rivals on its borders , the islamic republic may also feel increasingly threatened to such an extent that it could step up its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons in a bid to protect itself .
this in turn could lead to newly empowered states such as saudi arabia stepping up their own atomic ambitions , sparking a nuclear arms race in the gulf - something the us hopes its conventional weapons deals can negate .
" even if iran has not taken a decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability - and this is still unproven either way - it could spark a proliferation cascade if policymakers in saudi arabia decide that it too must acquire such capability , " ulrichsen said .
gulf power struggles play into the hands of arms dealers the delicate state of power in the gulf makes it a rich environment for nations whose arms industries are hugely important to their economies .
the us deals are likely to rankle with a number of rival weapons suppliers such as france and russia - both of whom have strategic links to the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is among the leading european arms dealers " europeans and americans have long competed for foreign arms contracts in asia and the middle east , " daniel keohane , a senior researcher at the european union institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
" this competition is becoming fiercer since european defense budgets are declining relative to the rest of the world , especially compared with rapidly rising defense spending in east asia and the middle east . "
" the real story here , however , is not a foreign sales arms race between european and american allies , but the actual arms race between countries in the middle east . "
fear of saudi arabia approaching a rival supplier is also a driving force behind washington 's desire to seal the deals .
france , russia , britain and - most worryingly - china are all ready to step in and provide riyadh with the weapons it needs if the us can not .
with not only sales but strategic relations and influence at stake , the us would be losing more than a few billion dollars in profits if the saudi kingdom looked elsewhere .
" arms sales to the gulf states have always provided very attractive and lucrative opportunities to weapons exporters , " said dr. ulrichsen .
" while the majority of the sales have come from us companies , western european , russian and chinese companies have all acquired substantial contracts in recent years . "
" the gulf states have been diversifying their security arrangements lately , signified most visibly by the opening of a french military base in abu dhabi in may 2009 .
this was part of an acceleration of french arms sales to the uae , which already provide almost half of the emirate 's military equipment . "
" france has been energetically attempting to get the uae to purchase its rafale warplanes instead of us-made f16s but a deal worth between $ 5bn and $ 10bn has yet to be concluded , and demonstrates the stakes involved between competing french and american interests . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 19.10.2010 new moscow mayor is a friend of putin , not of free press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever runs moscow is at the mercy of the kremlin sergei sobyanin is the kremlin 's man of choice to become the new mayor of moscow .
he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda is the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released late last week by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany ’ s biggest club says it ’ s prepared to sue the dutch football federation over two gimpy stars . coach louis van gaal 's bayern may have got back on the winning track domestically over the weekend , but the mood in munich is anything but happy .
as the german giants prepare for their next champions league fixture with a makeshift squad dubbed " louis ' remnants , " club management is firing verbal salvos at their dutch neighbors .
specifically , the bosses in saebener street are unhappy about dutch stars arjen robben and mark van bommel aggravating injuries while playing for their national side .
and they 're threatening to take the matter to court , if they do n't receive a major cash compensation .
" we want to know by the end of the month whether an agreement is possible , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told a dutch tv station over the weekend .
" if not , it becomes a legal question .
and should it come to trial , it will have bosman-like dimensions . "
the 1995 bosman ruling , which allowed players to become free agents , completely changed the world of football .
rummenigge and others would like to see a similar revolution in the relations between professional clubs and national football associations .
the question is : are federations such as the dutch knvb responsible if players get hurt while on duty for their national sides ?
and if so , are associations liable to pay damages to those players ' employers ?
preventable injuries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's bosses want robben on the pitch earning trophies for them arjen robben , bayern 's stand-out winger , tore a hamstring in a friendly for the netherlands last summer just before the start of the 2010 world cup .
this sort of injury normally requires weeks to heal , but robben made a miraculous recovery to play in south africa - only to turn up re-injured for the start of the bundesliga season , in which he has yet to compete .
at the time , bayern 's chief physician repeatedly said the medical staff of the knvb should not have allowed robben to play .
and tempers flared again last week when holding midfielder mark van bommel was sidelined after exacerbating a knee condition while on international duty for the netherlands .
bayern are now demanding an undisclosed sum in the millions from the knvb to compensate for financial damage resulting from the two players ' absence .
" in sporting terms we already have been disadvantaged , " rummenigge fumed in a weekend interview with the german news agency dpa .
" we have to do without our best player from last season for five months . "
other prominent coaches , including arsenal 's arsene wenger , have been peeved at the knvb in the past , and national federations have doled out nominal compensation fees for injured players in the past .
but it 's unlikely that bayern can force through the sums and the change in operating procedure the club management would like .
dutch courage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say players like van bommel are themselves to blame the knvb , for its part , does n't seem all that worried about the legal threats from southern germany .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they should file their suit today instead of tomorrow , " federation director bert van oostveen told a dutch newspaper last friday .
oostveen was speaking just after fifa , soccer 's international governing body , had given the knvb its medical center of excellence award .
a summit meeting between the knvb and bayern has been planned for this week in an attempt to resolve the conflict .
meanwhile , others have suggested that a player himself should be held accountable and his salary withheld if he willingly risks physical harm .
" if the risk ahead of a game is 50-50 that an injury will be aggravated , i ca n't allow myself to be played , " german football legend turned commentator guenter netzer wrote in his regular column for bild newspaper .
" it can not be that the employer who pays the player is the one to bear the financial brunt of the injury . "
netzer has a point in that the world 's top players aspire to and personally profit from playing for the national team , even though it 's essentially just a side job .
but it would be difficult to draw a legal line between where personal ambition ends and pressure from national associations on players begins .
accountability is n't easy to assign .
that 's one of the many issues bayern munich will have to ponder as they decide whether to make good on their legal threats .
in the meantime , bayern 's bosses will have to hope their stars make speedy recoveries - and that the remnants get the job done against cluj .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.10.2010 us takes calculated risks with arab arms deals in volatile persian gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us aims to rearm its arab allies in the persian gulf with the threat of iran looming large over the region , the us is boosting the military capabilities of friendly arab states in deals worth billions of dollars .
but the arms sales carry huge risks as well as huge profits . the largest procurement of arms by the persian gulf 's arab states in living memory could destabilize the region , boost the ailing united states ' military-industrial complex and set off new rivalries in the highly competitive world of weapons sales , according to middle east and security experts .
the deals struck between the us , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , oman and kuwait , estimated at $ 122.88 billion -lrb- 88.4 billion euros -rrb- over the next four years , will be among the largest rearmament exercises the persian gulf has ever seen - if and when it is approved by us congress .
the largest component of the proposed gulf deal is the $ 67 billion agreement struck with the saudis which will see boeing restock the oil-rich gulf state 's air force with 85 new f-15 jet fighters while refurbishing 70 existing planes ; lockheed martin will provide upgraded radar and missile defense systems and the us defense industry will pump some $ 30 billion into the saudis ' eastern naval fleet .
in addition , the uae will spend up to $ 40 billion on lockheed martin 's thaad high-altitude missile defense system and join kuwait in upgrading its existing patriot missile batteries .
kuwait will also replace and upgrade its warplanes and command and control systems to the tune of $ 7 billion while oman will spend $ 12 billion to do the same with 18 new f-16 jet fighters and upgrades for another 12 thrown in for good measure .
new security structure designed to reinvigorate arms industry by rearming its allies in the gulf , the us is laying the groundwork for a new security structure in the region which it hopes will provide benefits not just in the short term but for the foreseeable future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been pumping billions into military missions initially , the deals will give the us arms industry the huge shot in the arm it currently needs , replenishing the coffers which have been drained by the global economic crisis and the spiralling costs of supplying us-led military adventures in afghanistan and iraq .
in the long term , by boosting the gulf states ability to protect themselves and by promoting the regional bloc known as the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- which the arab signatories belong to , the us hopes that it will have to spend far less money in the future defending its allies in the gulf .
an increased regional deterrence would reduce the need for expensive troop deployments and ensure the flow of energy exports from the gulf without direct us military involvement .
however , a direct consequence of the us upgrading the armed forces of friendly arab states could be a heightened sense of rivalry and competition in the gulf - which is both a desired effect and a hugely inflammatory risk .
arab states switch from defensive to offensive capability " while the sale of arms and weapons-systems to the gcc states is not new , the significance lies in the fact that the deals include the provision of sophisticated offensive capabilities to the gulf states , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , a gulf expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants gulf states to be militarily self-sufficient " in previous cases these would have been opposed by israel and the us congress , but opposition has been muted in this instance owing to the implicit recognition that the gulf states , and saudi arabia in particular , are being armed to enable them to assert military leadership in the gulf and counter iranian influence . "
while iran may be forced to think twice about flexing its muscles with heavily-armed rivals on its borders , the islamic republic may also feel increasingly threatened to such an extent that it could step up its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons in a bid to protect itself .
this in turn could lead to newly empowered states such as saudi arabia stepping up their own atomic ambitions , sparking a nuclear arms race in the gulf - something the us hopes its conventional weapons deals can negate .
" even if iran has not taken a decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability - and this is still unproven either way - it could spark a proliferation cascade if policymakers in saudi arabia decide that it too must acquire such capability , " ulrichsen said .
gulf power struggles play into the hands of arms dealers the delicate state of power in the gulf makes it a rich environment for nations whose arms industries are hugely important to their economies .
the us deals are likely to rankle with a number of rival weapons suppliers such as france and russia - both of whom have strategic links to the gulf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is among the leading european arms dealers " europeans and americans have long competed for foreign arms contracts in asia and the middle east , " daniel keohane , a senior researcher at the european union institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
" this competition is becoming fiercer since european defense budgets are declining relative to the rest of the world , especially compared with rapidly rising defense spending in east asia and the middle east . "
" the real story here , however , is not a foreign sales arms race between european and american allies , but the actual arms race between countries in the middle east . "
fear of saudi arabia approaching a rival supplier is also a driving force behind washington 's desire to seal the deals .
france , russia , britain and - most worryingly - china are all ready to step in and provide riyadh with the weapons it needs if the us can not .
with not only sales but strategic relations and influence at stake , the us would be losing more than a few billion dollars in profits if the saudi kingdom looked elsewhere .
" arms sales to the gulf states have always provided very attractive and lucrative opportunities to weapons exporters , " said dr. ulrichsen .
" while the majority of the sales have come from us companies , western european , russian and chinese companies have all acquired substantial contracts in recent years . "
" the gulf states have been diversifying their security arrangements lately , signified most visibly by the opening of a french military base in abu dhabi in may 2009 .
this was part of an acceleration of french arms sales to the uae , which already provide almost half of the emirate 's military equipment . "

the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany . german president christian wulff has criticized " sweeping statements " about a failure of muslim immigrants to integrate , ahead of a visit to the turkish parliament on tuesday .
the president arrived in turkey on monday to begin a five-day trip that has been overshadowed by a national debate in germany about muslim integration .
" i believe it is a mistake to maintain that a whole group is unable and unwilling to integrate , " wulff told the turkish newspaper hurriyet 's tuesday edition .
seizing opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's comments follow merkel 's claim that multi-culturalism has failed " it comes down to individuals , " wulff said , adding that the state and society had to offer opportunities to integrate .
" in return , individuals must accept these opportunities .
wulff was set to meet turkish president abdullah gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday , before giving a speech in the turkish parliament .
his comments to the newspaper came after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that multiculturalism in germany had " failed completely " and that immigrants should do more to integrate . the debate about islam and integration reached a new level in germany when a then member of the country 's central bank , thilo sarrazin , launched a book claiming that muslim immigrants were undermining german culture .
although sarrazin subsequently resigned from the bank , his book has been a bestseller .
bid to calm integration debate at the start of the month , wulff tried to calm the controversy by claiming that - along with christianity and judaism - islam was now also a part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was set to meet turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan his comments sparked reaction from conservative politicians , such as bavarian state premier horst seehofer , who said germany should not accept more immigration from " foreign cultures " such as turkey and arab countries .
the president also used the newspaper interview to address the issue of turkish entry to the european union .
he said it was in germany 's interest that turkey should continue to adopt european economic , legal and constitutional standards .
wulff said that turkey 's negotiations to join the eu should be handled in a fair and open-minded way , adding that the country had already made considerable progress .
germany has some four million muslims among its 82 million inhabitants , with some 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority in the country .

he is scheduled to be voted in this week and likely to back the regime with little regard for dissenting voices . " there is opposition , look !
only 24 out of 25 deputies have voted for me , " sergei sobyanin said just after deputies of the local parliament in siberia had endorsed his appointment as governor of the oil province tyumen in 2000 .
this week he faces a similar vote , this time about his candidacy for the post of moscow mayor .
deputies of the moscow city council , mostly belonging to the ruling united russia party , are expected to give their full support to sobyanin .
indeed , the vote is generally seen as nothing more than a formality .
the deputies had their first informal meetings with sobyanin on monday , and according to some media reports , they were " elated . "
tackling corruption and traffic jams president dmitry medvedev presented sobyanin on friday as the man he would like to see as the future mayor of the russian capital .
first and foremost , he said , sobyanin will have to tackle widespread corruption , as well as the endless traffic jams marring the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei sobyanin has been a steady ally of putin in the past according to medvedev , " little had been done " in recent years to combat corruption , a clear reference to the previous mayor .
yuri luzhkov was ousted last month - after 18 years - because the president " lost confidence " in him .
the dismissal followed a smear campaign against luzhkov on several tv channels , accusing him and his wife of widespread fraud and corruption .
sobyanin 's appointment is expected to have great political significance , with parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2011 and 2012 .
the moscow vote , as always , will be of critical importance .
the peak of a steady career sergei sobyanin is a little known figure in russia .
he rarely gives interviews , although he has been one of russia 's most influential politicians for years .
since medvedev came to power in 2008 , he has served as deputy prime minister and chief of staff for prime minister vladimir putin .
he headed medvedev 's election staff in 2008 .
before moving to moscow , sobyanin was governor of tymen , an area twice the size of france , with a population of just 3.5 million .
the province is home to russia 's biggest oil and gas deposits , which are concentrated in two autonomous regions in the north .
sobyanin was born in one of the two , khanty-mansiysk , in 1958 .
he started his working life as a plumber , then studied to be a lawyer and an engineer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mayor luzhkov fell out with medvedev and putin during the 1980s he was active in the communist youth movement komsomol .
in the early 1990s he became mayor of the oil town of kogalym , later chairman of the legislature of the khanty-mansiysk region .
after that , with full support from the kremlin , he was elected governor of tyumen .
no tolerance for opposition under sobyanin 's rule , the province saw a construction boom , a legacy , which many saw as positive .
but he also turned out to be a rather rigid governor , who did not tolerate any resistance and took harsh measures against what was left of a free press .
" a journalist can not be independent , " he once said .
sobyanin also expressed sympathy for soviet dictator joseph stalin , praising the " development " of the country under his rule .
sobyanin has always been eager to express his loyalty to vladimir putin .
he supported putin 's candidacy for the presidency in 2000 and was the first governor to become a member of the kremlin party united russia .
in 2005 putin brought him to moscow to become his chief of staff - as the successor to dmitry medvedev , who had at the time become a deputy prime minister .
" they say that russia 's wealth grows from siberia , " putin said at the time .
" well , siberians know best how to do this . "

left to its own devices , hochtief is digging in for a hard fight . after initial overtures pointed to a possible intervention in the takeover bid of essen-based hochtief by a rival international construction company , the german government has backed down from its position in favor of letting the market run its course .
spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- in september announced its intention – which has been described as hostile – to increase its nearly 30 percent stake in essen-based hochtief and gain control of the company .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel called on berlin to protect hochtief when he visited the company 's headquarters last week , as german media reports suggested the government was contemplating changing securities laws to make the takeover more difficult .
however , economics minister rainer bruederle denied monday that government intervention would take place .
" naturally we would like for hochtief to stay in essen , and that as many taxes as possible are paid in germany , ” he said .
“ but i am not intervening in the market process , as many reports state . ”
government spokesman steffen seibert said that although officials were examining whether securities regulations should be made more stringent , preliminary findings did not support such a move .
“ any alteration of our takeover laws is unlikely , ” seibert said , adding that the federal government saw little scope for legal action against the acs bid .
one-month extension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle maintains that berlin should not get involved hochtief has prepared a number of defenses against the takeover bid , including a possible capital increase .
by creating new shares , hochtief could water down acs 's current 30 percent stake in the company and make a controlling stake more expensive to obtain .
and hochtief now has an additional month to shore up its defenses .
acs has been granted a month-long extension to its offer deadline by german financial regulator bafin , meaning it now expects to complete its offer in january 2011 instead of by mid-december , as was initially planned .
as part of deal with bafin , acs announced friday it is planning a shareholder meeting within the next 35 days with the intention of conducting a capital increase of its own .
according to stefan roehle , a frankfurt-based analyst with independent research , bafin blocked acs ' initial plan to offer 8 shares of acs for every 5 shares of hochtief because acs did n't have enough available shares on hand .
“ that is a requirement of bafin , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ naturally that delays the entire takeover process . ”
australian subsidiary another line of defense for hochtief is its australian subsidiary , leighton , which delivers about 80 percent of the concern 's total earnings .
australian regulators are being asked to rule whether acs will be required to bid on outstanding minority shares in leighton , should it take over hochtief .
" that could become really expensive for acs , ” roehle said , adding that asking regulators to require the bids to be made in cash and at a premium is a “ poisoned pill ” strategy .
there has been some speculation that hochtief could go so far as to transfer its ownership to leighton to protect itself from acs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acs president florentino perez is also president of the real madrid football club not surprised now that the german government has backed away from intervention plans , hochtief is left to its own devices , roehle said , adding that “ it 's going to be difficult for hochtief . ”
“ all of this is designed to stir up uncertainty at acs , which helps to win time , ” he said .
“ but if it will actually hinder a takeover by acs is questionable . ”
roehle said he was n't surprised berlin wo n't intervene , in part because of a precedent set by cases including the near-bankruptcy of the department store chain karstadt .
it was saved earlier this year by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen , rather than by a government bailout .
“ we 've seen this before … where the government did n't involve itself , ” roehle said .

" the spanish agency for data protection -lrb- aepd -rrb- has opened disciplinary proceedings against google , " the government entity said in a statement on its website on monday .
the decision follows an investigation begun in may .
the aepd alleges that google has committed five offenses , all of which involve gathering data from unsecured wifi networks as vehicles passed through locations around spain to take photos for street view .
the complaint is unrelated to concerns elsewhere in europe about whether street view , a service that takes systematic street-level photographs of businesses and homes , constitutes a fundamental threat to people 's privacy .
the spanish complaint is an outgrowth of revelations in germany in may that google had inadvertently collected some errant data over open wifi networks , possibly including user names and passwords , financial records and other personal documents and files .
since then , google has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the united kingdom and has destroyed such data under the supervision of the data protection authorities in ireland . however , investigations are ongoing in other countries around the world , including the united states .
google has said it will launch street view in germany before the end of the year following many protests from the government and data protection authorities .
bildunterschrift : google is facing fines in spain of nearly 2.5 million euros google 's apology in a statement provided to deutsche welle , google apologized for the data collection .
" as we have said before , we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data in spain , " the statement said .
" this data has never been used in any google product and was never intended to be used by google in any way .
it 's important to remember that we typically collected only fragments of payload data , because our cars are on the move and our in-car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second . "
the aepd is charging google and its spanish subsidiary , google spain , for having collected and stored 13 gigabytes of data without the owner 's consent .
this could lead to fines totaling over 2.4 million euros .
having filed charges , the aepd is suspending its investigation pending the ruling of a madrid court on a related criminal investigation .

he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected . german president christian wulff has called on turkish immigrants to germany to integrate in to germany society , saying turks and germans " are closely connected . "
" our fellow citizens of turkish origin … are welcome in our country , and belong to our country , " he said in a speech to the turkish parliament in ankara .
" as your president , i urge every immigrant to actively integrate in our german society . "
his comments came amid a controversial debate at home on whether berlin had failed in efforts to integrate muslim immigrants .
the five-day trip was the first visit of a german president to turkey in a decade , while wulff 's speech marked the first time a german head of state had addressed the turkish parliament .
" we are old friends ...
the things that connect us are much more than the things that keep us apart , " wulff said after meeting with his turkish counterpart abdullah gul earlier in the day .
reiterating previous comments , gul said turkish immigrants needed to learn the german language .
however , he stressed that " instead of using the integration problem politically , everybody must help find a solution . "
multiculturalism vs. integration germany has around four million muslims among its population of 82 million , with 2.5 million turks forming the largest ethnic minority .
wulff 's comments come after chancellor angela merkel said on saturday that germany 's efforts to create a multicultural society had failed .
she urged immigrants to integrate , learn german and adopt german culture and values .
next week , merkel 's coalition cabinet plans to adopt new measures on immigration policies , emphasizing german language classes and combating forced marriages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's speech was a first for a german head of state in his speech , wulff stressed immigrants need not give up their cultural identity or background .
but those living in germany should respect and protect the values of the german constitution , including freedom of speech , equality and the right to a religiously and ideologically neutral state .
" those who wish to live in germany must follow these rules and accept our way of life , " he said .
wulff also touched on the subject of religion , calling on turkey and other islamic countries to be more open to christianity .
" we expect christians in muslim countries to have the same right to live their faith publicly , to educate their youth in theology and build churches -lsb- as muslims do in germany -rsb- , " he said .
" without a doubt , christianity belongs to turkey , " he said , recalling his unity day speech from earlier in october , in which he stated that islam had become part of germany . eu , cyprus also on the agenda wulff also commented on turkey 's struggling bid to join the european union .
he praised the country 's growing role in the region , but stressed that the eu accession talks did not guarantee full membership .
both merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are against full membership for turkey , instead suggesting that the country should settle for a " privileged partnership , " an option ankara has firmly rejected .
wulff also pushed for a resolution to turkey 's row with greece over cyprus , a dispute seen as a hurdle to ankara 's eu aspirations .

on september 19 , 2010 , the director general of germany ’ s international broadcaster , erik bettermann , signed an agreement to this effect in the egyptian capital .
at the end of 2007 , dw and the faculty of “ mass and media communication ” agreed on a memorandum of understanding .
on this basis , dw has since carried out numerous academy seminars and discussion sessions with renowned media partners from the region .
due to the high demand , the programs are now open to students of all faculties . with 155,000 students , cairo university is the largest university on the african continent and the “ mass and media communication ” faculty is the largest and most important of its kind in the arab-speaking world .
eighty-five percent of students enrolled in the faculty are female .
dw hopes to contribute to the training of qualified media specialists by means of this expanded cooperation .
within the scope of the cooperation with cairo university , deutsche welle has already been able to acquire key local partners .
the partnership with the private cultural institution sawy , for example , enables dw to host intercultural events at cairo ’ s most famous cultural center every six to eight weeks .
these events are held in collaboration with german institutions such as the goethe institute , the friedrich naumann foundation and the konrad adenauer foundation .
meetings with regional media partners alongside cairo university , the private german university in cairo -lrb- guc -rrb- has also been one of deutsche welle ’ s most important partners in egypt for several years now . during his stay in cairo , dw director general bettermann will continue the theme of cooperation in discussions with the head of the university , professor ashraf mansour . bettmann will discuss the “ role of social media on development ” with guc students .
in 2007 , bettermann inaugurated the joint project “ campus radio ” at the guc .
the trendsetting digital campus radio and tv relies on the cooperation between guc , fraunhofer iis erlangen and dw .
it enables students to transmit and receive broadcasts via digital radio mondiale -lrb- drm -rrb- , digital video broadcast-h as well as the internet .
together with other high-ranking media representatives , bettermann is also taking part in a media policy discussion hosted by the friedrich naumann foundation .
the discussion “ rebel rousers or mediator ?
the role of the media in inter-cultural dialogue ” follows on from past discussion sessions with german political foundations in egypt , which have addressed the impact of the media on the inter-cultural exchange of information and thus initiated long-standing debates directly on location .
in addition , bettermann will meet with anas el fiki , minister of information , hani helal , minister of higher education and research and osama al sheikh , director of the egyptian radio and tv union -lrb- ertu -rrb- .
deutsche welle and ertu have enjoyed a close partnership for many years now .
in june 2008 , they launched a jointly produced show entitled “ youth across borders ” .
the monthly talk show , which is produced alternately in berlin and cairo , grapples with subjects affecting young people across cultural borders .
both institutions also collaborate in radio broadcasts and further education . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 05 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .
