the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" i want to remind mrs. tymoshenko that the basis of democracy is the will of the people , " he said .
" democratic leaders always accept the results of the elections . "
political tensions remained high wednesday as supporters of yanukovych rallied outside the electoral commission headquarters for the third straight day , hoping to ensure the electoral results stand .
according to preliminary results announced by the ukrainian central elections commission , former prime minister yanukovych won 48.95 percent of sunday 's presidential vote , compared to 45.47 percent for tymoshenko .
inauguration far away thus far tymoshenko has resisted conceding defeat , and has made no public appearances since sunday night , when she urged regional representatives to carefully check the vote count and " fight for every vote . "
some of tymoshenko ’ s supporters have said it would be best for her to step down and enter into opposition , while other aides and supporters have said she will challenge the results in court .
" voting day displayed a cynical violation of ukrainian law by the teams of yanukovych , " a tymoshenko party deputy , sergiy sobolev , told parliament .
" we will defend in the courts your right , our citizens , to honest and transparent elections . "
legal action could put off the official publication of sunday 's results , which would in turn delay the inauguration of a new president .
that typically occurs within 30 days after the results are officially released .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych looks set to become ukraine 's new president but yanukovych 's win was already being praised by russia , where the dominant united russia party considers yanukovych 's regions party a close ally .
russian president dmitry medvedev congratulated yanukovych in a telephone call on tuesday .
international observers have described the elections as " free and fair . "
election monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the vote had been an " impressive display " of democracy at work .
eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton also praised the " calm atmosphere " of the vote and said europe was ready to work with yanukovych .
" the european union remains committed to deepening the relationship with ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda .
it looks forward to working with the new president to this end , " ashton said in a statement .
election squabble could harm economic recovery prolonged uncertainty about the outcome could hurt ukraine 's ailing economy and scare away investors .
the country badly needs to restart talks with the international monetary fund on a $ 16.4-billion -lrb- 12-billion-euro -rrb- bailout package which got bogged down over breaches in fiscal restraint .
with gross domestic product shrinking by 15 percent in 2009 , ukraine was hit worse by the global economic crisis than any other major european economy .
bitter campaign sunday 's presidential ballot followed a bitter electoral campaign during which opinion polls were banned .
each candidate had accused the other of trying to rig the vote and analysts had warned that after ballot stations closed late on sunday , their tussle could shift to court wrangles and even street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic crisis has led to civil unrest in ukraine ukrainians have become largely disillusioned with politics in their country - almost six years after the euphoria of the 2004 orange revolution , when the telegenic tymoshenko helped sweep the pro-western viktor yushchenko into the office of president on promises of reform .
in january 's first round , yushchenko ended up in fifth place , paying the price for slumping living standards , diffidence among investors and squabbles with tymoshenko .
struggle for stability compared with past ukrainian elections , when yanukoviych was portrayed as the pro-russian candidate , this time glaring policy differences are few .
both candidates say they want to integrate into europe , while improving ties with moscow .
tymoshenko has demonstrated enthusiasm for seeking european union membership .
but , in recent months , she also appeared in photo opportunities alongside russian prime minister vladimir putin .
critics fault yanukovych , a former mechanic , for not explaining allegations of vote-rigging in 2004 .
analysts say his appeal is strong among voters disillusioned by the aftermath of the orange revolution. acb / gb / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : matthew kang send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .
it remains to be seen whether calls by social welfare groups for a 500-euro monthly minimum for children will become a reality. mk / gb / dpa / apn / epd / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .
it remains to be seen whether calls by social welfare groups for a 500-euro monthly minimum for children will become a reality. mk / gb / dpa / apn / epd / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one marjah elder , who wished to remain anonymous , told the guardian newspaper that he had evacuated his family a week ago because he feared " the worst attack ever . "
" always when they storm a village the foreign troops never care about civilian casualties at all .
and at the end of the day they report the deaths of women and children as the deaths of taliban , " he said . the number of civilian deaths in afghanistan is one of the main reasons why faith is running low among afghans when it comes to believing their government and the western forces in their country .
fears of fatalities among the marjah population is driving many out of their homes . nato and afghan officials have warned civilians in marjah to keep their heads down as their troops prepare for the major offensive . a nato spokesperson in afghanistan , speaking on condition of anonymity , told deutsche welle that the citizens of marjah had been informed of the offensive and that those who remained in the region had been advised to stay in their homes .
those who had fled or were thinking of leaving marjah would be provided for by the local authorities who were prepared to deal with the influx of refugees , he said . the international committee of the red cross said there was no way to count the number of people who have left marjah because many have moved in with relatives or rented houses in nearby towns instead of registering for emergency relief . " it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .
the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations .

not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .
the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ghulam farooq noorzai , head of the provincial department of refugees and repatriation , told reporters that " people are still leaving the area " and that thousands more are expected to arrive in the coming days . fear of civilian deaths force many to flee but the local governor sought to reassure people in an attempt to prevent a mass exodus .
" everything is ok , " governor habibullah of the nad ali district , where marjah is located , told local news sources .
" we have organized local gatherings and described the objectives of these operations , and assured people they do not need to leave the area , that they will not be harmed in the upcoming operation , " he said . those who have already chosen to leave marjah are less convinced .
one marjah elder , who wished to remain anonymous , told the guardian newspaper that he had evacuated his family a week ago because he feared " the worst attack ever . "
" always when they storm a village the foreign troops never care about civilian casualties at all .
and at the end of the day they report the deaths of women and children as the deaths of taliban , " he said . the number of civilian deaths in afghanistan is one of the main reasons why faith is running low among afghans when it comes to believing their government and the western forces in their country .
fears of fatalities among the marjah population is driving many out of their homes . nato and afghan officials have warned civilians in marjah to keep their heads down as their troops prepare for the major offensive . a nato spokesperson in afghanistan , speaking on condition of anonymity , told deutsche welle that the citizens of marjah had been informed of the offensive and that those who remained in the region had been advised to stay in their homes .
those who had fled or were thinking of leaving marjah would be provided for by the local authorities who were prepared to deal with the influx of refugees , he said . the international committee of the red cross said there was no way to count the number of people who have left marjah because many have moved in with relatives or rented houses in nearby towns instead of registering for emergency relief . " it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .
the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ghulam farooq noorzai , head of the provincial department of refugees and repatriation , told reporters that " people are still leaving the area " and that thousands more are expected to arrive in the coming days . fear of civilian deaths force many to flee but the local governor sought to reassure people in an attempt to prevent a mass exodus .
" everything is ok , " governor habibullah of the nad ali district , where marjah is located , told local news sources .
" we have organized local gatherings and described the objectives of these operations , and assured people they do not need to leave the area , that they will not be harmed in the upcoming operation , " he said . those who have already chosen to leave marjah are less convinced .
one marjah elder , who wished to remain anonymous , told the guardian newspaper that he had evacuated his family a week ago because he feared " the worst attack ever . "
" always when they storm a village the foreign troops never care about civilian casualties at all .
and at the end of the day they report the deaths of women and children as the deaths of taliban , " he said . the number of civilian deaths in afghanistan is one of the main reasons why faith is running low among afghans when it comes to believing their government and the western forces in their country .
fears of fatalities among the marjah population is driving many out of their homes . nato and afghan officials have warned civilians in marjah to keep their heads down as their troops prepare for the major offensive . a nato spokesperson in afghanistan , speaking on condition of anonymity , told deutsche welle that the citizens of marjah had been informed of the offensive and that those who remained in the region had been advised to stay in their homes .
those who had fled or were thinking of leaving marjah would be provided for by the local authorities who were prepared to deal with the influx of refugees , he said . the international committee of the red cross said there was no way to count the number of people who have left marjah because many have moved in with relatives or rented houses in nearby towns instead of registering for emergency relief . " it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .
the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .

that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .

four years ago , the court initially ruled it was unconstitutional to shoot such planes down . the german constitutional court in karlsruhe is meeting wednesday to discuss the domestic use of the german military in campaigns to combat terrorism .
the court is once again debating the aviation security act , which currently does not allow the shooting down of hijacked planes .
four years ago the court ruled this would be unconstitutional .
however , the rest of the act which empowers the military to force aircraft into emergency landings with warning shots , has been allowed to remain on the books .
hijacked airplanes now the german states of hesse and bavaria want to make an amendment to the basic law .
presently , the police are responsible for dealing with hijacked aircraft .
however , hesse 's interior minister volker bouffier , argues that the police do not have the means to adequately ward off a terror attack from the air . bouffier referred to an incident in 2003 , when the pilot of a stolen plane threatened to fly into the european central bank in frankfurt . at the time , nobody knew who was responsible for dealing with the threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , a hijacked airplane threatened to fly into a bank in frankfurt difficult questions the karlsruhe judges have taken the requests of the two states as cause for an in-depth examination of the law .
the court felt compelled to reconsider in a constitutional examination " the extremely difficult question of the domestic deployment of the german federal armed forces , " said the chairman of the second senate , andreas voßkuhle .
the state of hesse has a special interest in clarifying the rights and responsibilities of airspace defense , said bouffier , given its proximity to frankfurt , home to europe 's busiest airport and a susceptible terrorist target .
a ruling by the constitutional court is expected in three months. smh / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .

the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .

about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .

" we need to clarify the incidents and draw appropriate consequences , " the minister told public broadcaster zdf in an interview .
germany 's military commissioner reinhold robbe , who was informed about the incidents , submitted a report to the parliament 's defense policy committee this week .
the scandal surface after a young soldier who trained at the camp came forward to describe soldiers being forced to drink alcohol to the point of vomiting and to eat raw pig 's liver .
he also said they were forced to complete climbing exercises in the nude .
robbe said the complaints were " basically " confirmed by the soldier 's divisional commander .
a spokesman for the mountain infantry unit acknowledged the events in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" the rituals were performed among the ranks , " he said , adding that new recruits were required to complete the hazing in order " to be considered a real mountain infantryman . "
an internal investigation into the hazing accusations found that the incidents took place outside the barracks and outside of official work hours .
according to the complaint , superiors were aware of the rituals but did not intervene. hf / ap / apn / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "

but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

four years ago , the court initially ruled it was unconstitutional to shoot such planes down . the german constitutional court in karlsruhe is meeting wednesday to discuss the domestic use of the german military in campaigns to combat terrorism .
the court is once again debating the aviation security act , which currently does not allow the shooting down of hijacked planes .
four years ago the court ruled this would be unconstitutional .
however , the rest of the act which empowers the military to force aircraft into emergency landings with warning shots , has been allowed to remain on the books .
hijacked airplanes now the german states of hesse and bavaria want to make an amendment to the basic law .
presently , the police are responsible for dealing with hijacked aircraft .
however , hesse 's interior minister volker bouffier , argues that the police do not have the means to adequately ward off a terror attack from the air . bouffier referred to an incident in 2003 , when the pilot of a stolen plane threatened to fly into the european central bank in frankfurt . at the time , nobody knew who was responsible for dealing with the threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , a hijacked airplane threatened to fly into a bank in frankfurt difficult questions the karlsruhe judges have taken the requests of the two states as cause for an in-depth examination of the law .
the court felt compelled to reconsider in a constitutional examination " the extremely difficult question of the domestic deployment of the german federal armed forces , " said the chairman of the second senate , andreas voßkuhle .
the state of hesse has a special interest in clarifying the rights and responsibilities of airspace defense , said bouffier , given its proximity to frankfurt , home to europe 's busiest airport and a susceptible terrorist target .
a ruling by the constitutional court is expected in three months. smh / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.02.2010 greek unions strike over spending cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stranded traveler at the athens airport after strikes ground flights public sector workers in greece have begun nationwide strikes protesting government measures to tackle the country 's debt crisis which has shaken the euro zone and prompted germany to work on a rescue package . aviation workers joined striking civil servants in greece , grounding flights and halting government services early on wednesday .
an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "

athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .

" it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .
the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .
it remains to be seen whether calls by social welfare groups for a 500-euro monthly minimum for children will become a reality. mk / gb / dpa / apn / epd / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.02.2010 scandal emerges over czech power giant 's use of commando unit to fight thieves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez has defended its controversial methods the czech power giant cez has recently found itself at the center of a scandal over shocking images of a well-trained commando unit it has used to fight electricity thieves . czech power giant cez is under increased pressure from the government following a scandal surrounding an armed team the company employs to deal with electricity thieves .
the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .
it remains to be seen whether calls by social welfare groups for a 500-euro monthly minimum for children will become a reality. mk / gb / dpa / apn / epd / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need to clarify the incidents and draw appropriate consequences , " the minister told public broadcaster zdf in an interview .
germany 's military commissioner reinhold robbe , who was informed about the incidents , submitted a report to the parliament 's defense policy committee this week .
the scandal surface after a young soldier who trained at the camp came forward to describe soldiers being forced to drink alcohol to the point of vomiting and to eat raw pig 's liver .
he also said they were forced to complete climbing exercises in the nude .
robbe said the complaints were " basically " confirmed by the soldier 's divisional commander .
a spokesman for the mountain infantry unit acknowledged the events in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" the rituals were performed among the ranks , " he said , adding that new recruits were required to complete the hazing in order " to be considered a real mountain infantryman . "

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .
greece 's situation is likely to be the focus at an informal summit of eu leaders on thursday , with european central bank president jean-claude trichet present. mk / hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .

“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .

" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .

" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .
but the leader of the social democratic party , frank-walter steinmeier , warned that the new self-assessment could contribute to the escalation of the situation in afghanistan .

on tuesday , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet approved sending 850 additional troops to afghanistan in response to a strategy change by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for afghanistan .
that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .
greece 's situation is likely to be the focus at an informal summit of eu leaders on thursday , with european central bank president jean-claude trichet present. mk / hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .
it remains to be seen whether calls by social welfare groups for a 500-euro monthly minimum for children will become a reality. mk / gb / dpa / apn / epd / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" i want to remind mrs. tymoshenko that the basis of democracy is the will of the people , " he said .
" democratic leaders always accept the results of the elections . "
political tensions remained high wednesday as supporters of yanukovych rallied outside the electoral commission headquarters for the third straight day , hoping to ensure the electoral results stand .
according to preliminary results announced by the ukrainian central elections commission , former prime minister yanukovych won 48.95 percent of sunday 's presidential vote , compared to 45.47 percent for tymoshenko .
inauguration far away thus far tymoshenko has resisted conceding defeat , and has made no public appearances since sunday night , when she urged regional representatives to carefully check the vote count and " fight for every vote . "
some of tymoshenko ’ s supporters have said it would be best for her to step down and enter into opposition , while other aides and supporters have said she will challenge the results in court .
" voting day displayed a cynical violation of ukrainian law by the teams of yanukovych , " a tymoshenko party deputy , sergiy sobolev , told parliament .
" we will defend in the courts your right , our citizens , to honest and transparent elections . "
legal action could put off the official publication of sunday 's results , which would in turn delay the inauguration of a new president .
that typically occurs within 30 days after the results are officially released .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych looks set to become ukraine 's new president but yanukovych 's win was already being praised by russia , where the dominant united russia party considers yanukovych 's regions party a close ally .
russian president dmitry medvedev congratulated yanukovych in a telephone call on tuesday .
international observers have described the elections as " free and fair . "
election monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the vote had been an " impressive display " of democracy at work .
eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton also praised the " calm atmosphere " of the vote and said europe was ready to work with yanukovych .
" the european union remains committed to deepening the relationship with ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda .
it looks forward to working with the new president to this end , " ashton said in a statement .
election squabble could harm economic recovery prolonged uncertainty about the outcome could hurt ukraine 's ailing economy and scare away investors .
the country badly needs to restart talks with the international monetary fund on a $ 16.4-billion -lrb- 12-billion-euro -rrb- bailout package which got bogged down over breaches in fiscal restraint .
with gross domestic product shrinking by 15 percent in 2009 , ukraine was hit worse by the global economic crisis than any other major european economy .
bitter campaign sunday 's presidential ballot followed a bitter electoral campaign during which opinion polls were banned .
each candidate had accused the other of trying to rig the vote and analysts had warned that after ballot stations closed late on sunday , their tussle could shift to court wrangles and even street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic crisis has led to civil unrest in ukraine ukrainians have become largely disillusioned with politics in their country - almost six years after the euphoria of the 2004 orange revolution , when the telegenic tymoshenko helped sweep the pro-western viktor yushchenko into the office of president on promises of reform .
in january 's first round , yushchenko ended up in fifth place , paying the price for slumping living standards , diffidence among investors and squabbles with tymoshenko .
struggle for stability compared with past ukrainian elections , when yanukoviych was portrayed as the pro-russian candidate , this time glaring policy differences are few .
both candidates say they want to integrate into europe , while improving ties with moscow .
tymoshenko has demonstrated enthusiasm for seeking european union membership .
but , in recent months , she also appeared in photo opportunities alongside russian prime minister vladimir putin .
critics fault yanukovych , a former mechanic , for not explaining allegations of vote-rigging in 2004 .
analysts say his appeal is strong among voters disillusioned by the aftermath of the orange revolution. acb / gb / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : matthew kang send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .
but the leader of the social democratic party , frank-walter steinmeier , warned that the new self-assessment could contribute to the escalation of the situation in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking away is not an option , said the foreign minister .
on tuesday , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet approved sending 850 additional troops to afghanistan in response to a strategy change by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for afghanistan .
that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .
but the leader of the social democratic party , frank-walter steinmeier , warned that the new self-assessment could contribute to the escalation of the situation in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking away is not an option , said the foreign minister .
on tuesday , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet approved sending 850 additional troops to afghanistan in response to a strategy change by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for afghanistan .
that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't expect any miracles , but serious work by all of us which may make a miracle , " said finland 's president tarja halonen , who co-hosted the summit with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and the baltic sea action group -lrb- bsag -rrb- .
the one-day summit produced over 100 pledges to fight increasing maritime traffic , over-fishing and the overconcentration of harmful nutrients caused by sewage and agricultural run-off .
leadership from 11 countries in the baltic region was present , including russia , sweden , denmark , finland , germany , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , belarus and norway .
bildunterschrift : oil spills have plagued the baltic sea for decades for over the past half century , the baltic sea has been subjected to oil spills , untreated sewage , and various forms of harmful dumping , including that of weapons .
lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite said on wednesday that " 40,000 tons of chemical weapons " still polluted the baltic and called on the united nations , the european union , and nato to help clean the sea of all weapons .
numerous ships sunk during the second world war are known to litter the bottom of the sea , finland 's halonen added .
experts say the amount of toxic dumping is not the only reason for the sea 's extreme vulnerability to pollution .
they say its narrow outlet to the atlantic ocean prevents its waters from being circulated .
some 90 million people live in countries either bordering the baltic sea or with major river tributaries , and norway 's prime minister jens stoltenberg said 15 percent of the world 's cargo traffic already passed through the baltic .
economic action - and opportunities increasing shipping heightens the risks of oil and chemical spills , and stoltenberg called for sustainable growth to secure the environmental and economic future of the region .
" actions are needed to make the baltic sea healthy , and we have to address these problems by taking care of our national economies and the economies of our neighbours , " russian prime minister vladimir putin said , adding the sea had " always united " the countries in the baltic region .
gas pipeline ' safe ' one key component of the economic development in the baltic region is the planned nord stream piepline that will transport russian gas to the european union .
vladimir putin defended the russian-led project against accusations it would further damage the baltic 's fragile environment .
" i believe that nord stream will be environmentally safe , reliable and a very good source of gas to europe , " putin said at the conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say algae levels are on the rise in the baltic bsag chairman , saara kankaarinta , said the summit provided numerous opportunities for companies willing to join the fight against pollution in the baltic .
" as an organization , we are first and foremost dedicated to saving the sea , but there are other reasons why some participants have come here .
companies involved in research and development will have special interests here , because they will be the first to begin creating these systems , and that means they will of course have an advantage over the competition later on , " kankaarinta told deutsche welle in an interview .
but in a speech following the talks , finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen , warned participants not to lose sight of the " environmental catastrophe " the baltic sea was becoming .
he urged those in attendance not to let the pledges made on wednesday become like other promises made in the past .
" the most important day is tomorrow , when we start implementing our commitments , " vanhanen said. glb / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .

that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

numerous ships sunk during the second world war are known to litter the bottom of the sea , finland 's halonen added .
experts say the amount of toxic dumping is not the only reason for the sea 's extreme vulnerability to pollution .
they say its narrow outlet to the atlantic ocean prevents its waters from being circulated .
some 90 million people live in countries either bordering the baltic sea or with major river tributaries , and norway 's prime minister jens stoltenberg said 15 percent of the world 's cargo traffic already passed through the baltic .
economic action - and opportunities increasing shipping heightens the risks of oil and chemical spills , and stoltenberg called for sustainable growth to secure the environmental and economic future of the region .
" actions are needed to make the baltic sea healthy , and we have to address these problems by taking care of our national economies and the economies of our neighbours , " russian prime minister vladimir putin said , adding the sea had " always united " the countries in the baltic region .
gas pipeline ' safe ' one key component of the economic development in the baltic region is the planned nord stream piepline that will transport russian gas to the european union .
vladimir putin defended the russian-led project against accusations it would further damage the baltic 's fragile environment .
" i believe that nord stream will be environmentally safe , reliable and a very good source of gas to europe , " putin said at the conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say algae levels are on the rise in the baltic bsag chairman , saara kankaarinta , said the summit provided numerous opportunities for companies willing to join the fight against pollution in the baltic .
" as an organization , we are first and foremost dedicated to saving the sea , but there are other reasons why some participants have come here .

but in a speech following the talks , finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen , warned participants not to lose sight of the " environmental catastrophe " the baltic sea was becoming .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

" we do n't expect any miracles , but serious work by all of us which may make a miracle , " said finland 's president tarja halonen , who co-hosted the summit with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and the baltic sea action group -lrb- bsag -rrb- .
the one-day summit produced over 100 pledges to fight increasing maritime traffic , over-fishing and the overconcentration of harmful nutrients caused by sewage and agricultural run-off .
leadership from 11 countries in the baltic region was present , including russia , sweden , denmark , finland , germany , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , belarus and norway .

some 90 million people live in countries either bordering the baltic sea or with major river tributaries , and norway 's prime minister jens stoltenberg said 15 percent of the world 's cargo traffic already passed through the baltic .
economic action - and opportunities increasing shipping heightens the risks of oil and chemical spills , and stoltenberg called for sustainable growth to secure the environmental and economic future of the region .

gas pipeline ' safe ' one key component of the economic development in the baltic region is the planned nord stream piepline that will transport russian gas to the european union .
vladimir putin defended the russian-led project against accusations it would further damage the baltic 's fragile environment .
" i believe that nord stream will be environmentally safe , reliable and a very good source of gas to europe , " putin said at the conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say algae levels are on the rise in the baltic bsag chairman , saara kankaarinta , said the summit provided numerous opportunities for companies willing to join the fight against pollution in the baltic .

companies involved in research and development will have special interests here , because they will be the first to begin creating these systems , and that means they will of course have an advantage over the competition later on , " kankaarinta told deutsche welle in an interview .
but in a speech following the talks , finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen , warned participants not to lose sight of the " environmental catastrophe " the baltic sea was becoming .
he urged those in attendance not to let the pledges made on wednesday become like other promises made in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.02.2010 germany contemplates handout for greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek economic stability is now relying on europe the ongoing economic woes of european union member greece have shaken the euro zone and have prompted germany to consider a rescue package to help athens out of its bind . day-long strikes have hit greece as germany says it is considering how it can help athens deal with its huge budget deficit .
the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .

ghulam farooq noorzai , head of the provincial department of refugees and repatriation , told reporters that " people are still leaving the area " and that thousands more are expected to arrive in the coming days . fear of civilian deaths force many to flee but the local governor sought to reassure people in an attempt to prevent a mass exodus .
" everything is ok , " governor habibullah of the nad ali district , where marjah is located , told local news sources .
" we have organized local gatherings and described the objectives of these operations , and assured people they do not need to leave the area , that they will not be harmed in the upcoming operation , " he said . those who have already chosen to leave marjah are less convinced .
one marjah elder , who wished to remain anonymous , told the guardian newspaper that he had evacuated his family a week ago because he feared " the worst attack ever . "
" always when they storm a village the foreign troops never care about civilian casualties at all .
and at the end of the day they report the deaths of women and children as the deaths of taliban , " he said . the number of civilian deaths in afghanistan is one of the main reasons why faith is running low among afghans when it comes to believing their government and the western forces in their country .
fears of fatalities among the marjah population is driving many out of their homes . nato and afghan officials have warned civilians in marjah to keep their heads down as their troops prepare for the major offensive . a nato spokesperson in afghanistan , speaking on condition of anonymity , told deutsche welle that the citizens of marjah had been informed of the offensive and that those who remained in the region had been advised to stay in their homes .
those who had fled or were thinking of leaving marjah would be provided for by the local authorities who were prepared to deal with the influx of refugees , he said . the international committee of the red cross said there was no way to count the number of people who have left marjah because many have moved in with relatives or rented houses in nearby towns instead of registering for emergency relief . " it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.02.2010 germany contemplates handout for greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek economic stability is now relying on europe the ongoing economic woes of european union member greece have shaken the euro zone and have prompted germany to consider a rescue package to help athens out of its bind . day-long strikes have hit greece as germany says it is considering how it can help athens deal with its huge budget deficit .
the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 10.02.2010 berlinale looks back on 60 years of war , scandal and glamour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 60th berlinale runs from february 11-21 it gathered hollywood stars in berlin 's post-war ruins , offended the us during the vietnam war , and brought glamour to the city 's greyest month .
the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k.

" we do n't expect any miracles , but serious work by all of us which may make a miracle , " said finland 's president tarja halonen , who co-hosted the summit with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and the baltic sea action group -lrb- bsag -rrb- .
the one-day summit produced over 100 pledges to fight increasing maritime traffic , over-fishing and the overconcentration of harmful nutrients caused by sewage and agricultural run-off .
leadership from 11 countries in the baltic region was present , including russia , sweden , denmark , finland , germany , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , belarus and norway .
bildunterschrift : oil spills have plagued the baltic sea for decades for over the past half century , the baltic sea has been subjected to oil spills , untreated sewage , and various forms of harmful dumping , including that of weapons .
lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite said on wednesday that " 40,000 tons of chemical weapons " still polluted the baltic and called on the united nations , the european union , and nato to help clean the sea of all weapons .
numerous ships sunk during the second world war are known to litter the bottom of the sea , finland 's halonen added .
experts say the amount of toxic dumping is not the only reason for the sea 's extreme vulnerability to pollution .
they say its narrow outlet to the atlantic ocean prevents its waters from being circulated .
some 90 million people live in countries either bordering the baltic sea or with major river tributaries , and norway 's prime minister jens stoltenberg said 15 percent of the world 's cargo traffic already passed through the baltic .
economic action - and opportunities increasing shipping heightens the risks of oil and chemical spills , and stoltenberg called for sustainable growth to secure the environmental and economic future of the region .
" actions are needed to make the baltic sea healthy , and we have to address these problems by taking care of our national economies and the economies of our neighbours , " russian prime minister vladimir putin said , adding the sea had " always united " the countries in the baltic region .
gas pipeline ' safe ' one key component of the economic development in the baltic region is the planned nord stream piepline that will transport russian gas to the european union .
vladimir putin defended the russian-led project against accusations it would further damage the baltic 's fragile environment .
" i believe that nord stream will be environmentally safe , reliable and a very good source of gas to europe , " putin said at the conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say algae levels are on the rise in the baltic bsag chairman , saara kankaarinta , said the summit provided numerous opportunities for companies willing to join the fight against pollution in the baltic .
" as an organization , we are first and foremost dedicated to saving the sea , but there are other reasons why some participants have come here .
companies involved in research and development will have special interests here , because they will be the first to begin creating these systems , and that means they will of course have an advantage over the competition later on , " kankaarinta told deutsche welle in an interview .
but in a speech following the talks , finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen , warned participants not to lose sight of the " environmental catastrophe " the baltic sea was becoming .
he urged those in attendance not to let the pledges made on wednesday become like other promises made in the past .
" the most important day is tomorrow , when we start implementing our commitments , " vanhanen said. glb / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .

" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .

germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .

a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .

the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .

" we do n't expect any miracles , but serious work by all of us which may make a miracle , " said finland 's president tarja halonen , who co-hosted the summit with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and the baltic sea action group -lrb- bsag -rrb- .
the one-day summit produced over 100 pledges to fight increasing maritime traffic , over-fishing and the overconcentration of harmful nutrients caused by sewage and agricultural run-off .
leadership from 11 countries in the baltic region was present , including russia , sweden , denmark , finland , germany , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , belarus and norway .
bildunterschrift : oil spills have plagued the baltic sea for decades for over the past half century , the baltic sea has been subjected to oil spills , untreated sewage , and various forms of harmful dumping , including that of weapons .

numerous ships sunk during the second world war are known to litter the bottom of the sea , finland 's halonen added .

they say its narrow outlet to the atlantic ocean prevents its waters from being circulated .
some 90 million people live in countries either bordering the baltic sea or with major river tributaries , and norway 's prime minister jens stoltenberg said 15 percent of the world 's cargo traffic already passed through the baltic .

companies involved in research and development will have special interests here , because they will be the first to begin creating these systems , and that means they will of course have an advantage over the competition later on , " kankaarinta told deutsche welle in an interview .
but in a speech following the talks , finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen , warned participants not to lose sight of the " environmental catastrophe " the baltic sea was becoming .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .

germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .
greece 's situation is likely to be the focus at an informal summit of eu leaders on thursday , with european central bank president jean-claude trichet present. mk / hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .
greece 's situation is likely to be the focus at an informal summit of eu leaders on thursday , with european central bank president jean-claude trichet present. mk / hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said they were forced to complete climbing exercises in the nude .
robbe said the complaints were " basically " confirmed by the soldier 's divisional commander .
a spokesman for the mountain infantry unit acknowledged the events in an interview with german news agency dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.02.2010 germany contemplates handout for greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek economic stability is now relying on europe the ongoing economic woes of european union member greece have shaken the euro zone and have prompted germany to consider a rescue package to help athens out of its bind . day-long strikes have hit greece as germany says it is considering how it can help athens deal with its huge budget deficit .
the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .
but the leader of the social democratic party , frank-walter steinmeier , warned that the new self-assessment could contribute to the escalation of the situation in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking away is not an option , said the foreign minister .
on tuesday , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet approved sending 850 additional troops to afghanistan in response to a strategy change by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for afghanistan .
that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .
greece 's situation is likely to be the focus at an informal summit of eu leaders on thursday , with european central bank president jean-claude trichet present. mk / hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

four years ago , the court initially ruled it was unconstitutional to shoot such planes down . the german constitutional court in karlsruhe is meeting wednesday to discuss the domestic use of the german military in campaigns to combat terrorism .
the court is once again debating the aviation security act , which currently does not allow the shooting down of hijacked planes .
four years ago the court ruled this would be unconstitutional .
however , the rest of the act which empowers the military to force aircraft into emergency landings with warning shots , has been allowed to remain on the books .
hijacked airplanes now the german states of hesse and bavaria want to make an amendment to the basic law .
presently , the police are responsible for dealing with hijacked aircraft .
however , hesse 's interior minister volker bouffier , argues that the police do not have the means to adequately ward off a terror attack from the air . bouffier referred to an incident in 2003 , when the pilot of a stolen plane threatened to fly into the european central bank in frankfurt . at the time , nobody knew who was responsible for dealing with the threat .

the state of hesse has a special interest in clarifying the rights and responsibilities of airspace defense , said bouffier , given its proximity to frankfurt , home to europe 's busiest airport and a susceptible terrorist target .

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .

" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 10.02.2010 berlinale looks back on 60 years of war , scandal and glamour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 60th berlinale runs from february 11-21 it gathered hollywood stars in berlin 's post-war ruins , offended the us during the vietnam war , and brought glamour to the city 's greyest month .
the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .

four years ago , the court initially ruled it was unconstitutional to shoot such planes down . the german constitutional court in karlsruhe is meeting wednesday to discuss the domestic use of the german military in campaigns to combat terrorism .
the court is once again debating the aviation security act , which currently does not allow the shooting down of hijacked planes .
four years ago the court ruled this would be unconstitutional .
however , the rest of the act which empowers the military to force aircraft into emergency landings with warning shots , has been allowed to remain on the books .
hijacked airplanes now the german states of hesse and bavaria want to make an amendment to the basic law .
presently , the police are responsible for dealing with hijacked aircraft .
however , hesse 's interior minister volker bouffier , argues that the police do not have the means to adequately ward off a terror attack from the air . bouffier referred to an incident in 2003 , when the pilot of a stolen plane threatened to fly into the european central bank in frankfurt . at the time , nobody knew who was responsible for dealing with the threat .

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .
it remains to be seen whether calls by social welfare groups for a 500-euro monthly minimum for children will become a reality. mk / gb / dpa / apn / epd / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .
it remains to be seen whether calls by social welfare groups for a 500-euro monthly minimum for children will become a reality. mk / gb / dpa / apn / epd / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

four years ago , the court initially ruled it was unconstitutional to shoot such planes down . the german constitutional court in karlsruhe is meeting wednesday to discuss the domestic use of the german military in campaigns to combat terrorism .
the court is once again debating the aviation security act , which currently does not allow the shooting down of hijacked planes .
four years ago the court ruled this would be unconstitutional .
however , the rest of the act which empowers the military to force aircraft into emergency landings with warning shots , has been allowed to remain on the books .
hijacked airplanes now the german states of hesse and bavaria want to make an amendment to the basic law .
presently , the police are responsible for dealing with hijacked aircraft .
however , hesse 's interior minister volker bouffier , argues that the police do not have the means to adequately ward off a terror attack from the air . bouffier referred to an incident in 2003 , when the pilot of a stolen plane threatened to fly into the european central bank in frankfurt . at the time , nobody knew who was responsible for dealing with the threat .

the state of hesse has a special interest in clarifying the rights and responsibilities of airspace defense , said bouffier , given its proximity to frankfurt , home to europe 's busiest airport and a susceptible terrorist target .

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .
but the leader of the social democratic party , frank-walter steinmeier , warned that the new self-assessment could contribute to the escalation of the situation in afghanistan .

on tuesday , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet approved sending 850 additional troops to afghanistan in response to a strategy change by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for afghanistan .
that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .
but the leader of the social democratic party , frank-walter steinmeier , warned that the new self-assessment could contribute to the escalation of the situation in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking away is not an option , said the foreign minister .
on tuesday , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet approved sending 850 additional troops to afghanistan in response to a strategy change by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for afghanistan .
that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those who had fled or were thinking of leaving marjah would be provided for by the local authorities who were prepared to deal with the influx of refugees , he said . the international committee of the red cross said there was no way to count the number of people who have left marjah because many have moved in with relatives or rented houses in nearby towns instead of registering for emergency relief . " it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .
the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 10.02.2010 berlinale looks back on 60 years of war , scandal and glamour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 60th berlinale runs from february 11-21 it gathered hollywood stars in berlin 's post-war ruins , offended the us during the vietnam war , and brought glamour to the city 's greyest month .
the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .

the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .

but he did not name a withdrawal date as part of the new strategy . in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday , guido westerwelle called the mission in afghanistan " an armed conflict within the parameters of international law " and pushed for more troops to be sent to afghanistan .
" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .
different rules for germans unlike the troops of other countries involved in the afghan conflict , german military forces have until now been subjected to the civil penal code .
westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .
even if the final legal assessment remained subject to the judiciary , westerwelle sent " an important political signal , " he said .
but the leader of the social democratic party , frank-walter steinmeier , warned that the new self-assessment could contribute to the escalation of the situation in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking away is not an option , said the foreign minister .
on tuesday , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet approved sending 850 additional troops to afghanistan in response to a strategy change by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for afghanistan .
that brings the total number of german troops in afghanistan to more than 5,300 .
germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .
now merkel needs the bundestag or the lower house of parliament to approve the additional troops .
a new strategy westerwelle added that the main task of the german military in the coming months would be to train afghan police and soldiers .
in addition to extra troops , the government has also asked for 260 trainers to be sent to afghanistan to train local security forces .
the german government hopes to begin handing over responsibility to the afghans for their own security beginning in 2011 , westerwelle said .
however , he refused to name a specific date for troop withdrawal , saying it would only embolden terrorists. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .
if the aid package is approved , it would be the first time one of the 16 countries sharing the common currency , the euro , is bailed out .
greece 's situation is likely to be the focus at an informal summit of eu leaders on thursday , with european central bank president jean-claude trichet present. mk / hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have to call things by the proper name , we owe it to those who are exposing themselves to danger on the front lines , " the foreign minister said .

westerwelle 's reclassification of the ongoing conflict has legal consequences for the actions of german soldiers , as well as for its potential criminal rating .
" simply continuing as we have is not an option , " westerwelle told representatives .
" neither is walking away and looking away . "
escalating conflict defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg welcomed the new classification .

germany and its allies agreed to send more troops to afghanistan and put more focus on training the afghans themselves at a meeting in london in january .

" we do n't expect any miracles , but serious work by all of us which may make a miracle , " said finland 's president tarja halonen , who co-hosted the summit with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and the baltic sea action group -lrb- bsag -rrb- .
the one-day summit produced over 100 pledges to fight increasing maritime traffic , over-fishing and the overconcentration of harmful nutrients caused by sewage and agricultural run-off .
leadership from 11 countries in the baltic region was present , including russia , sweden , denmark , finland , germany , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , belarus and norway .
bildunterschrift : oil spills have plagued the baltic sea for decades for over the past half century , the baltic sea has been subjected to oil spills , untreated sewage , and various forms of harmful dumping , including that of weapons .
lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite said on wednesday that " 40,000 tons of chemical weapons " still polluted the baltic and called on the united nations , the european union , and nato to help clean the sea of all weapons .
numerous ships sunk during the second world war are known to litter the bottom of the sea , finland 's halonen added .
experts say the amount of toxic dumping is not the only reason for the sea 's extreme vulnerability to pollution .
they say its narrow outlet to the atlantic ocean prevents its waters from being circulated .
some 90 million people live in countries either bordering the baltic sea or with major river tributaries , and norway 's prime minister jens stoltenberg said 15 percent of the world 's cargo traffic already passed through the baltic .
economic action - and opportunities increasing shipping heightens the risks of oil and chemical spills , and stoltenberg called for sustainable growth to secure the environmental and economic future of the region .
" actions are needed to make the baltic sea healthy , and we have to address these problems by taking care of our national economies and the economies of our neighbours , " russian prime minister vladimir putin said , adding the sea had " always united " the countries in the baltic region .
gas pipeline ' safe ' one key component of the economic development in the baltic region is the planned nord stream piepline that will transport russian gas to the european union .
vladimir putin defended the russian-led project against accusations it would further damage the baltic 's fragile environment .
" i believe that nord stream will be environmentally safe , reliable and a very good source of gas to europe , " putin said at the conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say algae levels are on the rise in the baltic bsag chairman , saara kankaarinta , said the summit provided numerous opportunities for companies willing to join the fight against pollution in the baltic .
" as an organization , we are first and foremost dedicated to saving the sea , but there are other reasons why some participants have come here .
companies involved in research and development will have special interests here , because they will be the first to begin creating these systems , and that means they will of course have an advantage over the competition later on , " kankaarinta told deutsche welle in an interview .
but in a speech following the talks , finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen , warned participants not to lose sight of the " environmental catastrophe " the baltic sea was becoming .
he urged those in attendance not to let the pledges made on wednesday become like other promises made in the past .
" the most important day is tomorrow , when we start implementing our commitments , " vanhanen said. glb / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need to clarify the incidents and draw appropriate consequences , " the minister told public broadcaster zdf in an interview .
germany 's military commissioner reinhold robbe , who was informed about the incidents , submitted a report to the parliament 's defense policy committee this week .
the scandal surface after a young soldier who trained at the camp came forward to describe soldiers being forced to drink alcohol to the point of vomiting and to eat raw pig 's liver .
he also said they were forced to complete climbing exercises in the nude .
robbe said the complaints were " basically " confirmed by the soldier 's divisional commander .
a spokesman for the mountain infantry unit acknowledged the events in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" the rituals were performed among the ranks , " he said , adding that new recruits were required to complete the hazing in order " to be considered a real mountain infantryman . "
an internal investigation into the hazing accusations found that the incidents took place outside the barracks and outside of official work hours .
according to the complaint , superiors were aware of the rituals but did not intervene. hf / ap / apn / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

" we need to clarify the incidents and draw appropriate consequences , " the minister told public broadcaster zdf in an interview .
germany 's military commissioner reinhold robbe , who was informed about the incidents , submitted a report to the parliament 's defense policy committee this week .
the scandal surface after a young soldier who trained at the camp came forward to describe soldiers being forced to drink alcohol to the point of vomiting and to eat raw pig 's liver .
he also said they were forced to complete climbing exercises in the nude .
robbe said the complaints were " basically " confirmed by the soldier 's divisional commander .
a spokesman for the mountain infantry unit acknowledged the events in an interview with german news agency dpa .
" the rituals were performed among the ranks , " he said , adding that new recruits were required to complete the hazing in order " to be considered a real mountain infantryman . "
an internal investigation into the hazing accusations found that the incidents took place outside the barracks and outside of official work hours .

an estimated quarter of a million civil servants in greece are on strike to protest severe austerity measures .
on tuesday , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou outlined plans to freeze public sector wages and raise taxes in order to reduce greece 's spiraling debt .
the planned cuts include wage freezes and bonus cuts and could affect state schools , hospitals , tax offices and local government offices .
papandreou urges restraint the plans are part of the government 's pledge to cut the budget deficit , which rose to 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- last year .
athens hopes to bring the deficit to below the eu 's 3 percent ceiling by 2012 .
but the cuts have angered unions .
" they -lrb- the government -rrb- had promised the rich would pay but instead they take the money from the poor , " ilias iliopoulous , general secretary of the public sector union adedy , said .
" this is the policy we are fighting , not the effort to get out of the crisis . "
greek prime minister george papandreou has urged the unions to show restraint , saying the country could not afford strikes and blockades just as the government announced tax reforms and increased the retirement age .
" our primary duty is to save the economy and to reduce debt while seeking just solutions that protect as much as possible those on lower incomes and the middle class , " papandreou said on tuesday . fear of crisis spreading german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was said to be working both on a bilateral basis and at the european level in order to hammer out an aid package to help greece control its massive debt .
according to a report in the financial times deutschland , an unnamed german government official said berlin has decided to " take a significant step " in helping athens deal with the crisis so that other eurozone members can avoid negative consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is expected to inform his party about the aid package on wednesday " we are thinking about what we should do if the crisis spills from greece into other euro countries , " said the official .
" so it 's more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia echoed the fear of the crisis spreading beyond greece .
he also said it was important for eu leaders to match greece 's efforts to handle its debt .
" i would like the leaders of europe to say to the greek authorities that in exchange for the efforts you are making , you are going to get support from us , " he told the european parliament .

four years ago , the court initially ruled it was unconstitutional to shoot such planes down . the german constitutional court in karlsruhe is meeting wednesday to discuss the domestic use of the german military in campaigns to combat terrorism .
the court is once again debating the aviation security act , which currently does not allow the shooting down of hijacked planes .
four years ago the court ruled this would be unconstitutional .
however , the rest of the act which empowers the military to force aircraft into emergency landings with warning shots , has been allowed to remain on the books .
hijacked airplanes now the german states of hesse and bavaria want to make an amendment to the basic law .
presently , the police are responsible for dealing with hijacked aircraft .
however , hesse 's interior minister volker bouffier , argues that the police do not have the means to adequately ward off a terror attack from the air . bouffier referred to an incident in 2003 , when the pilot of a stolen plane threatened to fly into the european central bank in frankfurt . at the time , nobody knew who was responsible for dealing with the threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , a hijacked airplane threatened to fly into a bank in frankfurt difficult questions the karlsruhe judges have taken the requests of the two states as cause for an in-depth examination of the law .
the court felt compelled to reconsider in a constitutional examination " the extremely difficult question of the domestic deployment of the german federal armed forces , " said the chairman of the second senate , andreas voßkuhle .
the state of hesse has a special interest in clarifying the rights and responsibilities of airspace defense , said bouffier , given its proximity to frankfurt , home to europe 's busiest airport and a susceptible terrorist target .
a ruling by the constitutional court is expected in three months. smh / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's economic woes are threatening to destabilize the euro currency .
greece is currently struggling with a budget deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product - more than triple the maximum deficit allowed by european union regulators .
the fear is that if greece 's problems are n't nipped in the bud and the country 's economy defaults because of its debts , this could seriously affect some of the other debt-laden economies that share the euro currency , such as portugal , spain and italy .
the greek crisis has already led to an increase in borrowing costs for governments across europe , and caused a rise in the risk premium on german bonds .
it has also sent the euro currency sliding against the dollar .
the bailout risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has been considering a german-led deal to help greece cinzia alcidi from the centre for european policy studies told deutsche welle that this is an important reason why berlin is thinking about lending athens a hand .
" this is something that we all expected , because if there is a country that can help greece it is germany , " she says .
" the help would avoid a situation in which the euro zone could completely break down . "
but she says there is still a risk in countries like germany - europe 's strongest economy - bailing out their euro zone partners .
" on the one hand we have greece in a difficult situation .
to save the euro zone greece should be helped , " she says .
" on the other side , you want to avoid a situation where other countries are not willing to implement the necessary adjustments and are just waiting to be rescued by other countries without making the necessary efforts to improve their -lrb- fiscal -rrb- conditions . "
germany 's finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , is believed to be working bilaterally and at the european level on putting together an aid package for greece .
just what any aid deal would consist of is still a matter of speculation , but a german government official told the financial times deutschland it would be " more about finding firewalls , containing the problem , than principally about helping the greeks . "
more ' sense ' in brussels aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders will discuss the greece situation in brussels on thursday friedrich heinemann from the european centre for economic research told deutsche welle there is no doubt athens needs help to prevent its huge deficit from becoming a european problem .
but he says any aid should come with conditions attached .
" these conditions would be that greece really has to provide cuts , budgetary cuts , which should be not only of a certain quantity but also of a certain quality , " he says .
" greece must grow .
all the savings must spare the investment budget , because they are preconditions for further growth in greece . "
heinemann says however that help should come from brussels , and not from berlin .
" the european union is a community to a certain point , and there is no sense in single countries helping greece , and no argument in this , " he adds .
" and besides that , the european union , with the eu budget , has very nice instruments to impose sanctions on a country . "
there 'll be a special economic summit in brussels on thursday , where it 's thought european leaders will draw up a clear eu response to the situation . germany has set itself the task of helping to work out what that response should be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.02.2010 scandal emerges over czech power giant 's use of commando unit to fight thieves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez has defended its controversial methods the czech power giant cez has recently found itself at the center of a scandal over shocking images of a well-trained commando unit it has used to fight electricity thieves . czech power giant cez is under increased pressure from the government following a scandal surrounding an armed team the company employs to deal with electricity thieves .
the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .
the lawsuits and tuesday 's court 's verdict were criticized by german interior minister thomas de maizière .
the minister was quoted in german daily bild after the ruling .
" the verdict shows a problematic tendency toward an extreme case by case evaluation instead of a sensible lump sum payment , " said de maizière .

millions of german families on welfare could now receive more assistance . the constitutional court in karlsruhe has ruled that a five-year-old social welfare program known as hartz iv is unconstitutional .
the ruling means that the current benefits paid out to those who qualify , including child dependents , must be adjusted .
at present , adults receive 359 euros -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- , and children , depending on their age , between 215 euros and 287 euros .
bildunterschrift : the court ruled that welfare benefits are not ' transparent ' the court gave lawmakers until the end of 2010 to come up with new guidelines for germany 's 6.7 million hartz iv recipients .
about 1.7 million children under the age of 14 are among those affected .
the court said that the rules were not transparent enough and did not ensure at least a " dignified minimum " income .
the court 's decision was well received by a number of politicians , including german family minister kristina koehler .
" with its verdict , the court has established clarity and at the same time has considered the actual experience of many families with children , who are dependent on hartz iv , " said koehler in a press release .
" it is important and right , since it guarantees that the needs of children in families dependent on state benefits are appropriately considered . "
until now , the needs of young children and teens up to the age of 18 were not calculated separately .
depending on their ages , dependents of adult recipients received between 60 percent and 80 percent of what the parent or legal guardian received .
new rules could cost billions the constitutional court did not propose a methodology for recalculating the standard rates , but hans-juergen papier , the president of germany 's constitutional court , said benefits must be based on " reliable figures " and " comprehensible calculations . "
rough estimates are unconstitutional , papier said .
any adjustment upwards in social welfare expenditures is likely to cost taxpayers billions of euros and strain germany 's already hefty 100-billion-euro deficit .
however , german labor minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the court 's verdict .
" the ruling is non-negotiable and it is clear that society has to pay for this , " she told ntv news channel .
three families filed a lawsuit against the hartz iv guidelines in 2005 , arguing that the benefits for children were arbitrary and did not even cover minimum subsistence levels .
the case was first argued in two lower courts , which questioned the legality of the existing standard benefits , and asked the country 's highest court for clarification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 10.02.2010 ukraine election winner yanukovych calls on tymoshenko to resign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bitterly fought election process may now move to the courtroom opposition candidate viktor yanukovych has narrowly defeated prime minister yulia tymoshenko in ukraine 's presidential race , prompting him to demand tymoshenko concede defeat and resign as prime minister . recent ukrainian election winner viktor yanukovych has called on his opponent yulia tymoshenko to admit defeat and resign her position as prime minister , saying " the nation has spoken for a change in power . "
" i want to remind mrs. tymoshenko that the basis of democracy is the will of the people , " he said .
" democratic leaders always accept the results of the elections . "
political tensions remained high wednesday as supporters of yanukovych rallied outside the electoral commission headquarters for the third straight day , hoping to ensure the electoral results stand .
according to preliminary results announced by the ukrainian central elections commission , former prime minister yanukovych won 48.95 percent of sunday 's presidential vote , compared to 45.47 percent for tymoshenko .
inauguration far away thus far tymoshenko has resisted conceding defeat , and has made no public appearances since sunday night , when she urged regional representatives to carefully check the vote count and " fight for every vote . "
some of tymoshenko ’ s supporters have said it would be best for her to step down and enter into opposition , while other aides and supporters have said she will challenge the results in court .
" voting day displayed a cynical violation of ukrainian law by the teams of yanukovych , " a tymoshenko party deputy , sergiy sobolev , told parliament .
" we will defend in the courts your right , our citizens , to honest and transparent elections . "
legal action could put off the official publication of sunday 's results , which would in turn delay the inauguration of a new president .
that typically occurs within 30 days after the results are officially released .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych looks set to become ukraine 's new president but yanukovych 's win was already being praised by russia , where the dominant united russia party considers yanukovych 's regions party a close ally .
russian president dmitry medvedev congratulated yanukovych in a telephone call on tuesday .
international observers have described the elections as " free and fair . "
election monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the vote had been an " impressive display " of democracy at work .
eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton also praised the " calm atmosphere " of the vote and said europe was ready to work with yanukovych .
" the european union remains committed to deepening the relationship with ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda .
it looks forward to working with the new president to this end , " ashton said in a statement .
election squabble could harm economic recovery prolonged uncertainty about the outcome could hurt ukraine 's ailing economy and scare away investors .
the country badly needs to restart talks with the international monetary fund on a $ 16.4-billion -lrb- 12-billion-euro -rrb- bailout package which got bogged down over breaches in fiscal restraint .
with gross domestic product shrinking by 15 percent in 2009 , ukraine was hit worse by the global economic crisis than any other major european economy .
bitter campaign sunday 's presidential ballot followed a bitter electoral campaign during which opinion polls were banned .
each candidate had accused the other of trying to rig the vote and analysts had warned that after ballot stations closed late on sunday , their tussle could shift to court wrangles and even street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic crisis has led to civil unrest in ukraine ukrainians have become largely disillusioned with politics in their country - almost six years after the euphoria of the 2004 orange revolution , when the telegenic tymoshenko helped sweep the pro-western viktor yushchenko into the office of president on promises of reform .
in january 's first round , yushchenko ended up in fifth place , paying the price for slumping living standards , diffidence among investors and squabbles with tymoshenko .
struggle for stability compared with past ukrainian elections , when yanukoviych was portrayed as the pro-russian candidate , this time glaring policy differences are few .
both candidates say they want to integrate into europe , while improving ties with moscow .
tymoshenko has demonstrated enthusiasm for seeking european union membership .
but , in recent months , she also appeared in photo opportunities alongside russian prime minister vladimir putin .
critics fault yanukovych , a former mechanic , for not explaining allegations of vote-rigging in 2004 .
analysts say his appeal is strong among voters disillusioned by the aftermath of the orange revolution. acb / gb / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : matthew kang send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company set up a paramilitary-style commando unit to see to what are called “ non-technical losses ” , which means the theft of electricity via illegal connections to the grid .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , has called for checks on the legality of cez 's operations , while some other politicians have demanded the immediate dissolution of the anti-theft unit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech prime minister jan fischer wants the case to be investigated however , the company 's ceo martin roman said he has no intention of disbanding the division ; a move which he suggested would harm law-abiding customers .
“ electricity is stolen in large amounts by armed gangs who will stop at nothing and are prepared to use violence .
and those who steal electricity are n't stealing from cez , they are stealing from honest customers , ” roman told a news conference organized in response to the revelations .
some of those who steal electricity in the czech republic are also believed to be involved in another crime : operating illegal marijuana farms .
the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the cez boss told reporters that last year alone the company had uncovered more than 80 large-scale cannabis growing operations .
the amounts of electricity stolen are significant too .
the power utility said that since the special division was set up in 2005 it had uncovered a total of 15,000 cases of power theft , with losses amounting to over usd 25 million .
shocking images shooting practice , exercises in hooding and undressing a prisoner and endurance tests in extreme conditions feature in a training video of the armed unit that has been all over the czech media recently .
in a second , rather horrifying video , members of the unit are seen entering the home of an alleged electricity thief ; moments later the man is found lying in a pool of blood , having shot himself in the head upon their arrival .
both films are part of police evidence from an investigation into the armed unit 's activities .
the company has also pointed out that the shocking video images were recorded five years ago , and said it had changed its practices since then .
no power outage in sight cez is one of the largest players on the european energy market and has a lot of influence in the czech republic .
too much influence , according to some critics .
in fact , it has so much clout that some locals jokingly refer to the country as cezka republika , instead of the correct ceska republika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cez wields a great amount of influence in the czech republic prague-based journalist and commentator erik best said he did n't believe the commando unit affair would cause much harm to cez in the long term .
“ i think they 've done a pretty good job of justifying their actions since then , ” said best .
“ they got the support of the deputy interior minister , who said their current practices in terms of theft prevention have been dealt with . ”
however , cez is not out of the woods yet .
police in the czech republic are preparing charges of trespassing and blackmail against 32 members of the firm 's anti-theft unit following an investigation that was launched before the videos emerged .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .

the berlinale celebrates six decades of contention - and good film . in june 1951 , large parts of berlin were still piles of rubble , and the federal republic of germany was barely two years old .
in this bleak setting , in the unfashionable western district of steglitz , the first berlin film festival celebrated its opening with alfred hitchcock 's movie " rebecca . "
the spectacular oscar-winning melodrama , one of the biggest films produced by hollywood during the war , was already eleven years old , but the film 's star joan fontaine graced the event .
the berliners loved it . in the decade following , fontaine was followed by a herd of studio-era giants - sophia loren , henry fonda , errol flynn , cary grant , rita hayworth and others - who came to make the berlin festival into an a-list event .
like post-war berlin , the berlinale owes a lot to the united states , and this was a kind of marshall plan of glamour .
the western allies were rehabilitating the former capital of nazi germany in the best way they knew how - with show business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were long lines even at the first berlinale in 1951 but oscar martay , the officer of the occupying us military government credited as the initiator of the festival , was at least as interested in reviving germany 's proud cinematic tradition as in introducing american popular culture .
the first festival was also a popular success among berliners , with ceremonies and events sold out in venues across the city , and a fireworks display as a closing spectacle . but despite the early presence of hollywood , the berlinale did not become an " a-festival , " or a festival with an international competition accredited by the international federation of film producers associations -lrb- fiapf -rrb- , until 1955 .
this was when the golden bear award was first handed out by an invited international jury of film professionals .
until then , the competition had been decided by a public ballot , in keeping with its democratic , populist origin .
its rise to a-festival status promoted it to the league of serious film events , alongside cannes and venice . defiance in the sixties even in its relatively mainstream early years , the berlinale was marked by a spirit of political defiance .
for a long time it was the only a-festival to take place in a major capital city , and it soon found itself in the middle of a nascent global conflict .
at the third berlinale in 1953 , gary cooper used the festival as a platform to denounce joe mccarthy 's anti-communist repression at home .
cooper is also said to have wandered around berlin to witness july 's mass demonstrations against the communist regime .
-lrb- until 1978 the festival took place in the summer . -rrb- as the festival developed into the 1960s , it grew independent of its american roots , and became a showcase for the surging avant-garde in western europe .
jean-luc godard , michelangelo antonioni and roman polanski all won gold or silver bears in the decade .
but this shift towards social commentary and artistic complexity brought with it a crisis of confidence .
the conservative press was uninterested in artistic ambition , and missed the hollywood prestige .
there were also budget problems and audiences dwindled , not least of course because of the building of the berlin wall in 1961 . bildunterschrift : the early festivals were sexed up by the seductive magic of hollywood as the cold war escalated , it directly affected film selection .
the festival was still state-run , and political pressures meant that few films from the eastern bloc made it into the program .
this was partly relieved in 1967 , when the festival became a private company , though still with state backing .
diplomatic concerns could be circumvented , and films from socialist countries were once again invited , with the exception of east germany .
while politics continued to undermine the directors ' authority , at least a sheen of artistic autonomy prevailed . independence and scandal this newly-won independence may have come just in time .
in 1968 , the cannes festival was disrupted by student protests raging across europe , with influential french filmmakers showing solidarity with students .
there were fears that the berlinale would also be affected , but having been forewarned by the french example , the berlin directors hastily organized podium discussions in order to bring the student movement into the forum of the festival . but it was at the 1970 festival that the social upheavals of the decade came to a head at the festival , and almost ended the berlinale .
the german director michael verhoeven presented his vietnam war film " o.k. " in the competition , which depicted the true story of the rape and murder of a vietnamese girl by us soldiers .
the president of that year 's jury , american director george stevens , demanded that the film be thrown out of the competition for what he considered virulent anti-americanism . an american hangover the festival directors came under massive criticism when they acceded to his wish , justifying their decision by citing an old fiapf -lrb- international federation of film producers associations -rrb- guideline that said , " all film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations . "
the jury erupted in bitter conflict amid accusations of censorship , and eventually disbanded , suspending the competition .
films in the rest of the festival were withdrawn in protest , and suspicions were voiced that governments had intervened to keep " o.k. " off the screens . bildunterschrift : the rage over michael verhoeven 's -lrb- l . -rrb- film at the 1970 berlinale forced the competition to be abandoned , and almost ended the festival but the directors learned from this damaging timidity , and consistently protected the artist as other scandals followed throughout the 1970s , for example when in 1976 , prints of nagisa oshima 's " in the realm of the senses " were confiscated by the police as pornography , or rainer werner fassbinder faced accusations of anti-semitism in 1977 .
this penchant for scandal began to fix itself in the character of the festival . the troubled relationship with the us became a recurring theme , particularly in the 1970s , when a new generation of hollywood directors used the festival to showcase their darker images of the us .
not that this precluded the influence the cold war continued to have : in 1979 the communist states withdrew all their films out of protest at the depiction of the vietnam war in michael cimino 's " the deer hunter . " despite - or perhaps because of - these recurring scandals , the berlinale has grown in stature to become what quentin tarantino calls the world 's most " serious " film event .
while cannes and venice command more prestige in the international film industry , the berlinale 's unique attachment to its city - it remains incredibly popular among local film-goers - its sprawling range of sections , and its history , have made it a unique event . author : ben knight editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and at the end of the day they report the deaths of women and children as the deaths of taliban , " he said . the number of civilian deaths in afghanistan is one of the main reasons why faith is running low among afghans when it comes to believing their government and the western forces in their country .
fears of fatalities among the marjah population is driving many out of their homes . nato and afghan officials have warned civilians in marjah to keep their heads down as their troops prepare for the major offensive . a nato spokesperson in afghanistan , speaking on condition of anonymity , told deutsche welle that the citizens of marjah had been informed of the offensive and that those who remained in the region had been advised to stay in their homes .
those who had fled or were thinking of leaving marjah would be provided for by the local authorities who were prepared to deal with the influx of refugees , he said . the international committee of the red cross said there was no way to count the number of people who have left marjah because many have moved in with relatives or rented houses in nearby towns instead of registering for emergency relief . " it is very difficult for the icrc to provide a comprehensive figure as to the number of people who have left marjah and are now displaced in other villages , at this stage , " carla haddad mardini , spokesperson for international committee for the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- in geneva , told deutsche welle . " the icrc 's primary concern now is to make sure wounded and sick people have swift access to urgently needed medical care .
the icrc 's first aid post in marjah has recorded an increase in patients with weapon wounds in the last few weeks .
the organization will continue to closely follow developments on the ground , " she said . few places of true safety available to refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato operation in marjah is the biggest since 2001 even if the refugees make it to lashkar gah , their safety can not be assured .
the provincial capital has been hit by a number of attacks on the civilian population in recent weeks , the latest coming last friday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight .
the blast killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children . the people of marjah , a farming community and major opium-production center with a population of 80,000 , are currently under taliban control .
since infiltrating the region and taking control of billions of dollars worth of opium and heroin which comes from the fertile agricultural region , the taliban have overrun and replaced western-backed government institutions in the area and enforced sharia law on marjah 's inhabitants . the marjah operation - the biggest push since us president barack obama announced a new surge of troops to afghanistan , and the biggest since the 2001 us-led invasion - is aimed at pushing the taliban out of the region and reestablishing government control . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't expect any miracles , but serious work by all of us which may make a miracle , " said finland 's president tarja halonen , who co-hosted the summit with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and the baltic sea action group -lrb- bsag -rrb- .
the one-day summit produced over 100 pledges to fight increasing maritime traffic , over-fishing and the overconcentration of harmful nutrients caused by sewage and agricultural run-off .
leadership from 11 countries in the baltic region was present , including russia , sweden , denmark , finland , germany , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , belarus and norway .
bildunterschrift : oil spills have plagued the baltic sea for decades for over the past half century , the baltic sea has been subjected to oil spills , untreated sewage , and various forms of harmful dumping , including that of weapons .
lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite said on wednesday that " 40,000 tons of chemical weapons " still polluted the baltic and called on the united nations , the european union , and nato to help clean the sea of all weapons .
numerous ships sunk during the second world war are known to litter the bottom of the sea , finland 's halonen added .
experts say the amount of toxic dumping is not the only reason for the sea 's extreme vulnerability to pollution .
they say its narrow outlet to the atlantic ocean prevents its waters from being circulated .
some 90 million people live in countries either bordering the baltic sea or with major river tributaries , and norway 's prime minister jens stoltenberg said 15 percent of the world 's cargo traffic already passed through the baltic .
economic action - and opportunities increasing shipping heightens the risks of oil and chemical spills , and stoltenberg called for sustainable growth to secure the environmental and economic future of the region .
" actions are needed to make the baltic sea healthy , and we have to address these problems by taking care of our national economies and the economies of our neighbours , " russian prime minister vladimir putin said , adding the sea had " always united " the countries in the baltic region .
gas pipeline ' safe ' one key component of the economic development in the baltic region is the planned nord stream piepline that will transport russian gas to the european union .
vladimir putin defended the russian-led project against accusations it would further damage the baltic 's fragile environment .
" i believe that nord stream will be environmentally safe , reliable and a very good source of gas to europe , " putin said at the conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say algae levels are on the rise in the baltic bsag chairman , saara kankaarinta , said the summit provided numerous opportunities for companies willing to join the fight against pollution in the baltic .
" as an organization , we are first and foremost dedicated to saving the sea , but there are other reasons why some participants have come here .
companies involved in research and development will have special interests here , because they will be the first to begin creating these systems , and that means they will of course have an advantage over the competition later on , " kankaarinta told deutsche welle in an interview .
but in a speech following the talks , finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen , warned participants not to lose sight of the " environmental catastrophe " the baltic sea was becoming .
he urged those in attendance not to let the pledges made on wednesday become like other promises made in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 10.02.2010 ukraine election winner yanukovych calls on tymoshenko to resign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bitterly fought election process may now move to the courtroom opposition candidate viktor yanukovych has narrowly defeated prime minister yulia tymoshenko in ukraine 's presidential race , prompting him to demand tymoshenko concede defeat and resign as prime minister . recent ukrainian election winner viktor yanukovych has called on his opponent yulia tymoshenko to admit defeat and resign her position as prime minister , saying " the nation has spoken for a change in power . "
" i want to remind mrs. tymoshenko that the basis of democracy is the will of the people , " he said .
" democratic leaders always accept the results of the elections . "
political tensions remained high wednesday as supporters of yanukovych rallied outside the electoral commission headquarters for the third straight day , hoping to ensure the electoral results stand .
according to preliminary results announced by the ukrainian central elections commission , former prime minister yanukovych won 48.95 percent of sunday 's presidential vote , compared to 45.47 percent for tymoshenko .
inauguration far away thus far tymoshenko has resisted conceding defeat , and has made no public appearances since sunday night , when she urged regional representatives to carefully check the vote count and " fight for every vote . "
some of tymoshenko ’ s supporters have said it would be best for her to step down and enter into opposition , while other aides and supporters have said she will challenge the results in court .
" voting day displayed a cynical violation of ukrainian law by the teams of yanukovych , " a tymoshenko party deputy , sergiy sobolev , told parliament .
" we will defend in the courts your right , our citizens , to honest and transparent elections . "
legal action could put off the official publication of sunday 's results , which would in turn delay the inauguration of a new president .
that typically occurs within 30 days after the results are officially released .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych looks set to become ukraine 's new president but yanukovych 's win was already being praised by russia , where the dominant united russia party considers yanukovych 's regions party a close ally .
russian president dmitry medvedev congratulated yanukovych in a telephone call on tuesday .
international observers have described the elections as " free and fair . "
election monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the vote had been an " impressive display " of democracy at work .
eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton also praised the " calm atmosphere " of the vote and said europe was ready to work with yanukovych .
" the european union remains committed to deepening the relationship with ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda .
it looks forward to working with the new president to this end , " ashton said in a statement .
election squabble could harm economic recovery prolonged uncertainty about the outcome could hurt ukraine 's ailing economy and scare away investors .
the country badly needs to restart talks with the international monetary fund on a $ 16.4-billion -lrb- 12-billion-euro -rrb- bailout package which got bogged down over breaches in fiscal restraint .
with gross domestic product shrinking by 15 percent in 2009 , ukraine was hit worse by the global economic crisis than any other major european economy .
bitter campaign sunday 's presidential ballot followed a bitter electoral campaign during which opinion polls were banned .
each candidate had accused the other of trying to rig the vote and analysts had warned that after ballot stations closed late on sunday , their tussle could shift to court wrangles and even street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic crisis has led to civil unrest in ukraine ukrainians have become largely disillusioned with politics in their country - almost six years after the euphoria of the 2004 orange revolution , when the telegenic tymoshenko helped sweep the pro-western viktor yushchenko into the office of president on promises of reform .
in january 's first round , yushchenko ended up in fifth place , paying the price for slumping living standards , diffidence among investors and squabbles with tymoshenko .
struggle for stability compared with past ukrainian elections , when yanukoviych was portrayed as the pro-russian candidate , this time glaring policy differences are few .
both candidates say they want to integrate into europe , while improving ties with moscow .
tymoshenko has demonstrated enthusiasm for seeking european union membership .
but , in recent months , she also appeared in photo opportunities alongside russian prime minister vladimir putin .
critics fault yanukovych , a former mechanic , for not explaining allegations of vote-rigging in 2004 .
analysts say his appeal is strong among voters disillusioned by the aftermath of the orange revolution. acb / gb / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : matthew kang send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" i want to remind mrs. tymoshenko that the basis of democracy is the will of the people , " he said .
" democratic leaders always accept the results of the elections . "
political tensions remained high wednesday as supporters of yanukovych rallied outside the electoral commission headquarters for the third straight day , hoping to ensure the electoral results stand .
according to preliminary results announced by the ukrainian central elections commission , former prime minister yanukovych won 48.95 percent of sunday 's presidential vote , compared to 45.47 percent for tymoshenko .
inauguration far away thus far tymoshenko has resisted conceding defeat , and has made no public appearances since sunday night , when she urged regional representatives to carefully check the vote count and " fight for every vote . "
some of tymoshenko ’ s supporters have said it would be best for her to step down and enter into opposition , while other aides and supporters have said she will challenge the results in court .
" voting day displayed a cynical violation of ukrainian law by the teams of yanukovych , " a tymoshenko party deputy , sergiy sobolev , told parliament .
" we will defend in the courts your right , our citizens , to honest and transparent elections . "
