more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .
jürgen mertins , the press officer for the kunduz reconstruction team , says that there has been good cooperation with the afghan security forces “ in the past few months and we have carried out a whole series of operations .
we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .
jürgen mertins , the press officer for the kunduz reconstruction team , says that there has been good cooperation with the afghan security forces “ in the past few months and we have carried out a whole series of operations .
we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .
the head of the protestant church recently said there was “ nothing good ” about the operation .

more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !

government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

french authorities had so far counted six of their nationals among the dead .
canada announced that 1,415 of its citizens were missing . united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said he would visit the devastated country “ very soon . ”
as of friday , 37 of the un ’ s personnel in haiti were confirmed dead .

please bring us water or people will die soon , ” resident renelde lamarque , who was hosting some 500 quake victims in his front yard , told reuters . the us aimed to have a thousand troops in haiti on friday , with a further 10,000 set to arrive by monday .
that will include 300 medical personnel , 3,500 soldiers , 2,200 marines , a hospital ship , and other ships carrying supplies . the cuban government has also pledged to allow us military flights to use its normally restricted airspace to evacuate quake victims . among the most anticipated military arrivals was that of american aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson , which can be used as a supply base to fly in goods to the many areas cut off by buckled roads and toppled buildings . as international aid pours in , blocked roads and damage to communication systems have made distributing it a major challenge .
furthermore , traffic jams at port-au-prince airport forced many planes to circle for up to two hours before landing .
haitians are reportedly angry about having to wait for days with no help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have much to give , but its taking longer than expected to reach haitian survivors " we 've been out here waiting for three days and three nights but nothing has been done for us , not even a word of encouragement from the president , " pierre jackson told reuters news agency as he tended to his mother and sister who lay whimpering with crushed legs .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , italy 's top court overturned a law created by berlusconi to protect him from being prosecuted while in office . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was absent on friday for the first hearing of his corruption trial , in which he is accused of bribing a british lawyer to lie on the stand .
berlusconi 's lawyer , niccolo ghedini , said berlusconi had n't planned to show up at friday 's " technical " hearing , adding that the italian premier would attend when " issues of substance " were at hand .
prosecutors accuse berlusconi of ordering the 1997 payment of $ 600,000 -lrb- 416,000 euros -rrb- to lawyer david mills in exchange for his false testimony at two hearings in other corruption cases .
mills was sentenced in february to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting the bribe .
he maintains his innocence and is currently appealing the conviction .
berlusconi 's part of the trial resumed after italy 's constitutional court overturned a law last year protecting him from being prosecuted while in office .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .

marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 15.01.2010 biafra war anniversary highlights nigeria ’ s uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biafra was the scene of one of africa 's bloodiest wars .
" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

dw-world.de west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 15.01.2010 biafra war anniversary highlights nigeria ’ s uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biafra was the scene of one of africa 's bloodiest wars .
" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

dw-world.de west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .

this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .

in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .

the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .

the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .

the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .

then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

last year , italy 's top court overturned a law created by berlusconi to protect him from being prosecuted while in office . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was absent on friday for the first hearing of his corruption trial , in which he is accused of bribing a british lawyer to lie on the stand .
berlusconi 's lawyer , niccolo ghedini , said berlusconi had n't planned to show up at friday 's " technical " hearing , adding that the italian premier would attend when " issues of substance " were at hand .
prosecutors accuse berlusconi of ordering the 1997 payment of $ 600,000 -lrb- 416,000 euros -rrb- to lawyer david mills in exchange for his false testimony at two hearings in other corruption cases .
mills was sentenced in february to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting the bribe .
he maintains his innocence and is currently appealing the conviction .
berlusconi 's part of the trial resumed after italy 's constitutional court overturned a law last year protecting him from being prosecuted while in office .
at friday 's hearing , the three-judge panel rejected a defense motion arguing for a complete restart of berlusconi 's portion of the trial .
they suspended the trial until feb .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .
by joining the other 46 member states , russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to europe , " jagland said in a statement .
hearing of cases to be expedited deputy foreign minister andrei denisov said that passing the changes would significantly improve the kremlin 's own human rights record , which has been sharply criticized by rights groups in russia and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to improve relations between russia and the council of europe denisov added that the number of cases lodged at the echr was on the rise , with almost 30,000 of the current 112,000 rights complaints coming from russia .
of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .
by joining the other 46 member states , russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to europe , " jagland said in a statement .
hearing of cases to be expedited deputy foreign minister andrei denisov said that passing the changes would significantly improve the kremlin 's own human rights record , which has been sharply criticized by rights groups in russia and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to improve relations between russia and the council of europe denisov added that the number of cases lodged at the echr was on the rise , with almost 30,000 of the current 112,000 rights complaints coming from russia .
of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prosecutors accuse berlusconi of ordering the 1997 payment of $ 600,000 -lrb- 416,000 euros -rrb- to lawyer david mills in exchange for his false testimony at two hearings in other corruption cases .
mills was sentenced in february to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting the bribe .
he maintains his innocence and is currently appealing the conviction .
berlusconi 's part of the trial resumed after italy 's constitutional court overturned a law last year protecting him from being prosecuted while in office .
at friday 's hearing , the three-judge panel rejected a defense motion arguing for a complete restart of berlusconi 's portion of the trial .

the advisory follows cyber attacks against google believed made possible by the ie weaknesses . the german office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- says windows operating systems are at risk as a result of security gaps in microsoft 's internet explorer web browser .
the bsi says flaws in the program may have been the reason why hackers were recently able to conduct cyber attacks on search engine google and other us companies .
" the weaknesses make it possible for cyber attackers to start and lock computers that have a windows operating system , " the bsi said in a statement on its web site .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .
by joining the other 46 member states , russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to europe , " jagland said in a statement .
hearing of cases to be expedited deputy foreign minister andrei denisov said that passing the changes would significantly improve the kremlin 's own human rights record , which has been sharply criticized by rights groups in russia and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to improve relations between russia and the council of europe denisov added that the number of cases lodged at the echr was on the rise , with almost 30,000 of the current 112,000 rights complaints coming from russia .
of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .

of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 15.01.2010 head of stasi file archive says investigations are nowhere near end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police compiled a vast number of filed on its citizens twenty years ago thousands of protestors stormed the offices of east germany 's secret police , the stasi , looking for secret files on their lives .
deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 15.01.2010 general motors unveils new top management at opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the management change is the latest in a long-running saga at opel us carmaker gm have announced the new management team for its troubled opel unit .
nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

about 45,000-50,000 people have died and 300,000 have been made homeless , the un estimates . the us said it was sending 10,000 troops to the country while france said on friday it would urge creditors to speed efforts to cancel the impoverished caribbean nation 's debt . though the paris club of creditor nations agreed in july to clear haiti 's remaining $ 215 million debt to club members , the process can still take years to finalize . french finance minister christine lagarde said she asked members of the informal club to speed up the process .
the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

spain , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency , has also contributed three million euros . ashton had earlier said that " a large number of european union citizens " , including a european commission staffer from spain , were unaccounted for . news agency afp reported that a 61-year-old austrian woman working for a german aid group had been killed by a falling wall .
french authorities had so far counted six of their nationals among the dead .

that will include 300 medical personnel , 3,500 soldiers , 2,200 marines , a hospital ship , and other ships carrying supplies . the cuban government has also pledged to allow us military flights to use its normally restricted airspace to evacuate quake victims . among the most anticipated military arrivals was that of american aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson , which can be used as a supply base to fly in goods to the many areas cut off by buckled roads and toppled buildings . as international aid pours in , blocked roads and damage to communication systems have made distributing it a major challenge .
furthermore , traffic jams at port-au-prince airport forced many planes to circle for up to two hours before landing .
haitians are reportedly angry about having to wait for days with no help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have much to give , but its taking longer than expected to reach haitian survivors " we 've been out here waiting for three days and three nights but nothing has been done for us , not even a word of encouragement from the president , " pierre jackson told reuters news agency as he tended to his mother and sister who lay whimpering with crushed legs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 15.01.2010 general motors unveils new top management at opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the management change is the latest in a long-running saga at opel us carmaker gm have announced the new management team for its troubled opel unit .
nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

last year , italy 's top court overturned a law created by berlusconi to protect him from being prosecuted while in office . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was absent on friday for the first hearing of his corruption trial , in which he is accused of bribing a british lawyer to lie on the stand .

prosecutors accuse berlusconi of ordering the 1997 payment of $ 600,000 -lrb- 416,000 euros -rrb- to lawyer david mills in exchange for his false testimony at two hearings in other corruption cases .
mills was sentenced in february to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting the bribe .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .

council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .
by joining the other 46 member states , russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to europe , " jagland said in a statement .
hearing of cases to be expedited deputy foreign minister andrei denisov said that passing the changes would significantly improve the kremlin 's own human rights record , which has been sharply criticized by rights groups in russia and abroad .

of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 45,000-50,000 people have died and 300,000 have been made homeless , the un estimates . the us said it was sending 10,000 troops to the country while france said on friday it would urge creditors to speed efforts to cancel the impoverished caribbean nation 's debt . though the paris club of creditor nations agreed in july to clear haiti 's remaining $ 215 million debt to club members , the process can still take years to finalize . french finance minister christine lagarde said she asked members of the informal club to speed up the process .
the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

it will mark her first foreign trip since becoming the eu 's top diplomat , a post created by the lisbon treaty in december . eu , un contribute amid fears for their own the european commission has contributed three million euros -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- in initial aid to haiti but plans to increase that amount in the coming days .
spain , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency , has also contributed three million euros . ashton had earlier said that " a large number of european union citizens " , including a european commission staffer from spain , were unaccounted for . news agency afp reported that a 61-year-old austrian woman working for a german aid group had been killed by a falling wall .
french authorities had so far counted six of their nationals among the dead .

about 330 un personnel are still missing or unaccounted for , out of some 12,000 the organization has in haiti . “ i myself will go to haiti very soon , both to show solidarity with the people of haiti and our u.n. staff and to assess the situation for myself , ” ban told reporters . ban also said that up to half of the buildings in the capital of port-au-prince and surrounding areas had been destroyed or severely damaged . us secretary of state , hillary clinton , has also announced that she will arrive in haiti on saturday . aid stymied by damaged infrastructure despite a flood of aid from countries around the world , many haitians remain desperate for food , clean water , shelter and medical care . “ no one is helping us .

that will include 300 medical personnel , 3,500 soldiers , 2,200 marines , a hospital ship , and other ships carrying supplies . the cuban government has also pledged to allow us military flights to use its normally restricted airspace to evacuate quake victims . among the most anticipated military arrivals was that of american aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson , which can be used as a supply base to fly in goods to the many areas cut off by buckled roads and toppled buildings . as international aid pours in , blocked roads and damage to communication systems have made distributing it a major challenge .
furthermore , traffic jams at port-au-prince airport forced many planes to circle for up to two hours before landing .
haitians are reportedly angry about having to wait for days with no help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have much to give , but its taking longer than expected to reach haitian survivors " we 've been out here waiting for three days and three nights but nothing has been done for us , not even a word of encouragement from the president , " pierre jackson told reuters news agency as he tended to his mother and sister who lay whimpering with crushed legs .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 15.01.2010 head of stasi file archive says investigations are nowhere near end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police compiled a vast number of filed on its citizens twenty years ago thousands of protestors stormed the offices of east germany 's secret police , the stasi , looking for secret files on their lives .
deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .
by joining the other 46 member states , russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to europe , " jagland said in a statement .
hearing of cases to be expedited deputy foreign minister andrei denisov said that passing the changes would significantly improve the kremlin 's own human rights record , which has been sharply criticized by rights groups in russia and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to improve relations between russia and the council of europe denisov added that the number of cases lodged at the echr was on the rise , with almost 30,000 of the current 112,000 rights complaints coming from russia .
of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .

they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .
" people come here and eat their schnitzel and drink their beer - and they know that they can simply relax . " author : eva wutke editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .
jürgen mertins , the press officer for the kunduz reconstruction team , says that there has been good cooperation with the afghan security forces “ in the past few months and we have carried out a whole series of operations .
we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .

more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !

more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .
jürgen mertins , the press officer for the kunduz reconstruction team , says that there has been good cooperation with the afghan security forces “ in the past few months and we have carried out a whole series of operations .
we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .
the head of the protestant church recently said there was “ nothing good ” about the operation .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .

their many concerts worldwide are a revelation not only for audiences , but also for fellow musicians .
often , the polyphonia musicians will dig out intriguing works that are lesser known to the general public , such as louis spohr 's " grand nonetto " in f major , opus 31 , written in 1813 . the group played the work at a concert in algiers , the capital city of algeria , in november 2009 along with an adaptation of a mozart piano quintet .
performing in the broadcast hall of algerian national radio , polyphonia - this subgroup of musicians from the deutsches symphonie-orchester , dso - presented classical european music to northern african ears in cooperation with deutsche welle , the german foreign ministry and germany 's goethe institute .
the occasion for the tour was an historic one : celebrating the 20th anniversary of fall of the berlin wall . music as bridge between cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting cultural dialogue : andalusian trio ibne bajja playing with polyphonia part of polyphonia 's charisma lies in its ability to promote intercultural dialogue .
building bridges of musical and cultural understanding , the ensemble members give training to music students in germany and abroad . during its north african tour , which also included a concert in morocco , polyphonia held a two-day workshop with students of the algerian music academy .
the goal was to connect works of chamber music in the western european tradition to spanish and arab music traditions anchored in the region for hundreds of years .
it was a daunting task for the berlin musicians , considering that instruments played in european classical music look and sound different from arab instruments .
also , musicians in that part of the world do not rely as much on sheet music . " it is a totally different kind of music , " said oboist martin koegel .
" it 's not hard to play , but because of the many repetitions , it has a trance-like quality . "
he also pointed out the language barriers - with arabic sounding quite foreign to german ears . all of polyphonia 's musicians are members of the dso , whose current chief conductor and artistic director is ingo metzmacher . listen to polyphonia playing at the algiers concert by clicking on the audio links below . author : dagmar breitenbach / als editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 15.01.2010 biafra war anniversary highlights nigeria ’ s uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biafra was the scene of one of africa 's bloodiest wars .
" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 15.01.2010 disillusionment with bayern 's grand project fuels ribery 's desire to leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's sparkling allure has since dulled for ribery bayern munich 's signing of franck ribery in 2007 was a coup .
but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .

their many concerts worldwide are a revelation not only for audiences , but also for fellow musicians .
often , the polyphonia musicians will dig out intriguing works that are lesser known to the general public , such as louis spohr 's " grand nonetto " in f major , opus 31 , written in 1813 . the group played the work at a concert in algiers , the capital city of algeria , in november 2009 along with an adaptation of a mozart piano quintet .
performing in the broadcast hall of algerian national radio , polyphonia - this subgroup of musicians from the deutsches symphonie-orchester , dso - presented classical european music to northern african ears in cooperation with deutsche welle , the german foreign ministry and germany 's goethe institute .
the occasion for the tour was an historic one : celebrating the 20th anniversary of fall of the berlin wall . music as bridge between cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting cultural dialogue : andalusian trio ibne bajja playing with polyphonia part of polyphonia 's charisma lies in its ability to promote intercultural dialogue .
building bridges of musical and cultural understanding , the ensemble members give training to music students in germany and abroad . during its north african tour , which also included a concert in morocco , polyphonia held a two-day workshop with students of the algerian music academy .
the goal was to connect works of chamber music in the western european tradition to spanish and arab music traditions anchored in the region for hundreds of years .
it was a daunting task for the berlin musicians , considering that instruments played in european classical music look and sound different from arab instruments .
also , musicians in that part of the world do not rely as much on sheet music . " it is a totally different kind of music , " said oboist martin koegel .
" it 's not hard to play , but because of the many repetitions , it has a trance-like quality . "
he also pointed out the language barriers - with arabic sounding quite foreign to german ears . all of polyphonia 's musicians are members of the dso , whose current chief conductor and artistic director is ingo metzmacher . listen to polyphonia playing at the algiers concert by clicking on the audio links below . author : dagmar breitenbach / als editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .

" the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 15.01.2010 german bar steals sydney 's heart with one-liter beer steins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller organizes beer drinking and carrying contests a bavarian-style bar in sydney 's historic center has found its recipe for success : liter-sized beer steins , dirndl-clad servers , and plenty of something germans are admittedly less well-known for - fun . at the loewenbraeu keller in sydney , the staff are conspicuous , running around in traditional bavarian outfits .
the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .

their many concerts worldwide are a revelation not only for audiences , but also for fellow musicians .
often , the polyphonia musicians will dig out intriguing works that are lesser known to the general public , such as louis spohr 's " grand nonetto " in f major , opus 31 , written in 1813 . the group played the work at a concert in algiers , the capital city of algeria , in november 2009 along with an adaptation of a mozart piano quintet .
performing in the broadcast hall of algerian national radio , polyphonia - this subgroup of musicians from the deutsches symphonie-orchester , dso - presented classical european music to northern african ears in cooperation with deutsche welle , the german foreign ministry and germany 's goethe institute .
the occasion for the tour was an historic one : celebrating the 20th anniversary of fall of the berlin wall . music as bridge between cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting cultural dialogue : andalusian trio ibne bajja playing with polyphonia part of polyphonia 's charisma lies in its ability to promote intercultural dialogue .
building bridges of musical and cultural understanding , the ensemble members give training to music students in germany and abroad . during its north african tour , which also included a concert in morocco , polyphonia held a two-day workshop with students of the algerian music academy .
the goal was to connect works of chamber music in the western european tradition to spanish and arab music traditions anchored in the region for hundreds of years .
it was a daunting task for the berlin musicians , considering that instruments played in european classical music look and sound different from arab instruments .
also , musicians in that part of the world do not rely as much on sheet music . " it is a totally different kind of music , " said oboist martin koegel .
" it 's not hard to play , but because of the many repetitions , it has a trance-like quality . "
he also pointed out the language barriers - with arabic sounding quite foreign to german ears . all of polyphonia 's musicians are members of the dso , whose current chief conductor and artistic director is ingo metzmacher . listen to polyphonia playing at the algiers concert by clicking on the audio links below . author : dagmar breitenbach / als editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 15.01.2010 biafra war anniversary highlights nigeria ’ s uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biafra was the scene of one of africa 's bloodiest wars .
" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

their many concerts worldwide are a revelation not only for audiences , but also for fellow musicians .
often , the polyphonia musicians will dig out intriguing works that are lesser known to the general public , such as louis spohr 's " grand nonetto " in f major , opus 31 , written in 1813 . the group played the work at a concert in algiers , the capital city of algeria , in november 2009 along with an adaptation of a mozart piano quintet .
performing in the broadcast hall of algerian national radio , polyphonia - this subgroup of musicians from the deutsches symphonie-orchester , dso - presented classical european music to northern african ears in cooperation with deutsche welle , the german foreign ministry and germany 's goethe institute .
the occasion for the tour was an historic one : celebrating the 20th anniversary of fall of the berlin wall . music as bridge between cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting cultural dialogue : andalusian trio ibne bajja playing with polyphonia part of polyphonia 's charisma lies in its ability to promote intercultural dialogue .
building bridges of musical and cultural understanding , the ensemble members give training to music students in germany and abroad . during its north african tour , which also included a concert in morocco , polyphonia held a two-day workshop with students of the algerian music academy .
the goal was to connect works of chamber music in the western european tradition to spanish and arab music traditions anchored in the region for hundreds of years .
it was a daunting task for the berlin musicians , considering that instruments played in european classical music look and sound different from arab instruments .
also , musicians in that part of the world do not rely as much on sheet music . " it is a totally different kind of music , " said oboist martin koegel .
" it 's not hard to play , but because of the many repetitions , it has a trance-like quality . "
he also pointed out the language barriers - with arabic sounding quite foreign to german ears . all of polyphonia 's musicians are members of the dso , whose current chief conductor and artistic director is ingo metzmacher . listen to polyphonia playing at the algiers concert by clicking on the audio links below . author : dagmar breitenbach / als editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.01.2010 indonesian army 's business interests spark criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army justifies its involvement in business with need to raise money for troops a report published by human rights watch this week has once again highlighted the continuing influence of the military in indonesia .
more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 15.01.2010 biafra war anniversary highlights nigeria ’ s uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biafra was the scene of one of africa 's bloodiest wars .
" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .
jürgen mertins , the press officer for the kunduz reconstruction team , says that there has been good cooperation with the afghan security forces “ in the past few months and we have carried out a whole series of operations .
we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .
the head of the protestant church recently said there was “ nothing good ” about the operation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.01.2010 indonesian army 's business interests spark criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army justifies its involvement in business with need to raise money for troops a report published by human rights watch this week has once again highlighted the continuing influence of the military in indonesia .
more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .

protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .

" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .

this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests .

the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

that will include 300 medical personnel , 3,500 soldiers , 2,200 marines , a hospital ship , and other ships carrying supplies . the cuban government has also pledged to allow us military flights to use its normally restricted airspace to evacuate quake victims . among the most anticipated military arrivals was that of american aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson , which can be used as a supply base to fly in goods to the many areas cut off by buckled roads and toppled buildings . as international aid pours in , blocked roads and damage to communication systems have made distributing it a major challenge .
furthermore , traffic jams at port-au-prince airport forced many planes to circle for up to two hours before landing .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .

once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bsi recommended against using versions 6 , 7 and 8 of internet explorer on operating systems xp , vista and windows 7 until the programming faults had been corrected .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .

it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 15.01.2010 biafra war anniversary highlights nigeria ’ s uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biafra was the scene of one of africa 's bloodiest wars .
" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .
" people come here and eat their schnitzel and drink their beer - and they know that they can simply relax . " author : eva wutke editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 15.01.2010 head of stasi file archive says investigations are nowhere near end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police compiled a vast number of filed on its citizens twenty years ago thousands of protestors stormed the offices of east germany 's secret police , the stasi , looking for secret files on their lives .
deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .
by joining the other 46 member states , russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to europe , " jagland said in a statement .
hearing of cases to be expedited deputy foreign minister andrei denisov said that passing the changes would significantly improve the kremlin 's own human rights record , which has been sharply criticized by rights groups in russia and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to improve relations between russia and the council of europe denisov added that the number of cases lodged at the echr was on the rise , with almost 30,000 of the current 112,000 rights complaints coming from russia .
of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .

we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .
jürgen mertins , the press officer for the kunduz reconstruction team , says that there has been good cooperation with the afghan security forces “ in the past few months and we have carried out a whole series of operations .
we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .
the head of the protestant church recently said there was “ nothing good ” about the operation .

the bsi says flaws in the program may have been the reason why hackers were recently able to conduct cyber attacks on search engine google and other us companies .
" the weaknesses make it possible for cyber attackers to start and lock computers that have a windows operating system , " the bsi said in a statement on its web site .
google said on tuesday that china-based cyber spies struck the internet giant in an apparent bid to hack into the email accounts of human rights activists around the world , describing the attack as " highly sophisticated . "
the bsi recommended against using versions 6 , 7 and 8 of internet explorer on operating systems xp , vista and windows 7 until the programming faults had been corrected .
microsoft said in a statement that damage caused by the security gaps had been limited and that it was working on a series of patches to fix the problem. dfm / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .

of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .

of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 15.01.2010 disillusionment with bayern 's grand project fuels ribery 's desire to leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's sparkling allure has since dulled for ribery bayern munich 's signing of franck ribery in 2007 was a coup .
but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .
it could have been the start of a surge to another title - in fact , it was a false dawn .
that spring , the wheels came off . in one terrible month of april , bayern were thrashed 5-1 by wolfsburg in the league and 4-0 in barcelona in the quarter-finals of the champions league .
klinsmann was sacked , munich crashed out of europe , and dropped off the pace in the title race .
jupp heynckes was brought in to steady the ship and achieve the minimum goal of champions league qualification but the campaign was viewed as a failure .
ribery managed nine goals but ended his second season empty-handed and disillusioned . " the absolute beating they took from barcelona in that quarter-final at camp nou showed just how far away from the european elite bayern really was , " luke faron , a european soccer reporter at theoffside.com , told deutsche welle .
" it would have to have been the turning point . " two seasons into a four-year deal and ribery was again the subject of intense transfer speculation .
by summer the rumor mill was running overtime .
real madrid allegedly offered 60 million euros for his signature ; chelsea were reported to have offered 40 million euros while barcelona and man united were also back in . clash of personalities turn the dream sour it could have just been another summer of innuendo until ribery allegedly told french media : " i want to leave .
it is real or nothing . "
this was the first time the frenchman had stated his wish to be done with bayern .
it sparked a war of words with the munich hierarchy which ranged from stone-wall denials that ribery was leaving to disgusted proclamations that the frenchman was not worth the grief and he could go .
ribery finally retracted and denied his comments and settled down sheepishly for pre-season training , still kitted out in bayern attire .
then came the arrival of louis van gaal as coach , another factor many experts believe has contributed to ribery 's apparent desire to leave munich and the bundesliga behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery 's body language screams " get me outta here " " the structured , disciplinarian dutchman is n't quite to the jovial , practical-joking ribery 's taste , " luke faron said . " they also had a public spat about how ribery would be used in van gaal 's system .
this was papered over a bit by ribery 's goal celebration against dortmund , when he sprinted to the sideline and leaped into the arms of his surprised manager , but tension remains . " the playmaker has been making headlines more for his indecision over his career than any soccer reasons -lrb- he ’ s made just six appearances and scored one goal -rrb- , and has said that he will decide on his future before the world cup in south africa in june .
he has not ruled out extending his bayern contract but with the usual suspects watching developments closely , a move to london or madrid can not be discounted , especially as he could go for nothing at the end of next season . signs suggest ribery 's time in germany is almost up " ribery seems to dream of a big club like real madrid all the time , " said the abendzeitung ’ s patrick strasser .
" nobody says it but everybody at bayern believes that he will leave in the summer .
real is interested as ever with zinedine zidane , ribery 's idol , trying again to convince him to join madrid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real legend zidane favors a madrid move for ribery luke faron agrees : " unless bayern have their longest champions league run since winning it all in 2001 , i think you can expect to see ribery in madrid in next season . " " bayern should have sold ribery during the last off-season , " said david hein .
" his value will likely never be higher and bayern are traditionally a very fiscally conscious team .
they could have used that money to find another playmaker looking to prove themselves - just like ribery was when he came to bayern .
i think things have run their course in his eyes and he would like a fresh start . " if he does go , questions will again be asked about what bayern 's current stature is on the european stage , and the attractiveness of the bundesliga .
but the most likely reason would be the inability of bayern to realize the ambitious plans they made back in the summer of 2007 ; unfulfilled promises that ribery himself seems to have finally accepted were just pipe dreams . " i would really like to win the champions league , but our team does n't have the necessary firepower right now , " the frenchman told the bild daily recently .
" at the moment , we ca n't compete . " the smart money is on ribery moving to a team which can . author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 15.01.2010 german bar steals sydney 's heart with one-liter beer steins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller organizes beer drinking and carrying contests a bavarian-style bar in sydney 's historic center has found its recipe for success : liter-sized beer steins , dirndl-clad servers , and plenty of something germans are admittedly less well-known for - fun . at the loewenbraeu keller in sydney , the staff are conspicuous , running around in traditional bavarian outfits .
the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .

" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 15.01.2010 general motors unveils new top management at opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the management change is the latest in a long-running saga at opel us carmaker gm have announced the new management team for its troubled opel unit .
nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

for years , russia had been the only european nation to resist the reforms . russian legislators gave the green light on friday to reforms to the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , marking a dramatic change in the way the kremlin sees the institution .
the lower house of russian parliament voted 392 to 56 to ratify protocol 14 of the 2004 european rights convention , which called for changes to help improve the way the court processes cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is looking to streamline the echr the document required approval by all members of the bloc 's human rights watchdog - the council of europe - to come into force , and russia had been the only member to hold out .
council secretary-general thorbjorn jagland called the move significant for the future of the court and " key for the modernization of russia 's judicial system . "
" today 's approval of the ratification will clearly help the reform process .
by joining the other 46 member states , russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to europe , " jagland said in a statement .
hearing of cases to be expedited deputy foreign minister andrei denisov said that passing the changes would significantly improve the kremlin 's own human rights record , which has been sharply criticized by rights groups in russia and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants to improve relations between russia and the council of europe denisov added that the number of cases lodged at the echr was on the rise , with almost 30,000 of the current 112,000 rights complaints coming from russia .
of these cases , however , only a fraction will ever seen by the court .
once the court accepts a case , the plaintiff must prove that the state played a role in the matter , after which the echr issues a judgement to the country , or an order to launch an investigation .
protocol 14 's reforms are meant to strengthen the court 's ability to throw out clearly inadmissible cases and increase judges ' discretion to reject minor complaints .
to complete the ratification process , russian president dmitry medvedev and the upper house of parliament must give their endorsement ; both are widely expected to do so. glb / ap / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.01.2010 indonesian army 's business interests spark criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army justifies its involvement in business with need to raise money for troops a report published by human rights watch this week has once again highlighted the continuing influence of the military in indonesia .
more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

but aid distribution continues to be hampered by logistics . governments around the world pledged to help haitians recover and rebuild their lives after tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake devastated the country .
about 45,000-50,000 people have died and 300,000 have been made homeless , the un estimates . the us said it was sending 10,000 troops to the country while france said on friday it would urge creditors to speed efforts to cancel the impoverished caribbean nation 's debt . though the paris club of creditor nations agreed in july to clear haiti 's remaining $ 215 million debt to club members , the process can still take years to finalize . french finance minister christine lagarde said she asked members of the informal club to speed up the process .
the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

please bring us water or people will die soon , ” resident renelde lamarque , who was hosting some 500 quake victims in his front yard , told reuters . the us aimed to have a thousand troops in haiti on friday , with a further 10,000 set to arrive by monday .
that will include 300 medical personnel , 3,500 soldiers , 2,200 marines , a hospital ship , and other ships carrying supplies . the cuban government has also pledged to allow us military flights to use its normally restricted airspace to evacuate quake victims . among the most anticipated military arrivals was that of american aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson , which can be used as a supply base to fly in goods to the many areas cut off by buckled roads and toppled buildings . as international aid pours in , blocked roads and damage to communication systems have made distributing it a major challenge .

she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 15.01.2010 head of stasi file archive says investigations are nowhere near end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police compiled a vast number of filed on its citizens twenty years ago thousands of protestors stormed the offices of east germany 's secret police , the stasi , looking for secret files on their lives .
deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

last year , italy 's top court overturned a law created by berlusconi to protect him from being prosecuted while in office . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was absent on friday for the first hearing of his corruption trial , in which he is accused of bribing a british lawyer to lie on the stand .
berlusconi 's lawyer , niccolo ghedini , said berlusconi had n't planned to show up at friday 's " technical " hearing , adding that the italian premier would attend when " issues of substance " were at hand .
prosecutors accuse berlusconi of ordering the 1997 payment of $ 600,000 -lrb- 416,000 euros -rrb- to lawyer david mills in exchange for his false testimony at two hearings in other corruption cases .
mills was sentenced in february to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting the bribe .
he maintains his innocence and is currently appealing the conviction .
berlusconi 's part of the trial resumed after italy 's constitutional court overturned a law last year protecting him from being prosecuted while in office .
at friday 's hearing , the three-judge panel rejected a defense motion arguing for a complete restart of berlusconi 's portion of the trial .
they suspended the trial until feb .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal . " i think ribery chose bayern because he was only 24 at the time and i think they were offering big money .
luca toni had just been signed a week earlier and klose was also in the frame to join from bremen so i think he also saw it as a chance to shine for a big time club , " hein told deutsche welle . ribery 's choice to move to bayern seemed to be paying off in his first season .
he excelled and tore german defenses apart , looking every cent of the 25 million euros bayern paid for his silky services .
the frenchman scored 11 goals as bayern won the german cup and the bundesliga title .
the promise of domestic glory at least had been kept as ribery ended his first season in bavaria laden with medals and accolades . bayern 's surge to the semifinal of the uefa cup suggested too that they might have the european credentials to build on when they stepped up into the champions league the following season .
ribery would have entered the 2008-09 season with optimism . cracks appear as bundesliga and european failures bite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the barca thrashing showed ribery bayern 's limitations but bayern 's bundesliga campaign under new coach juergen klinsmann started erratically , and ribery and co. had to battle back from 11th to climb to second place at the winter break .

when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .

but is the club 's failure to fulfill its own ambitious plans undermining ribery 's commitment to the club and fuelling his desire to move on ? it was a signing which sent shockwaves through european soccer .
when bayern munich paid 25 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- for marseille and france midfielder franck ribery in june 2007 , it signaled a change in the bavarian giants ' transfer policy .
bayern would be spending big on world stars in a bid to challenge not only for the bundesliga but also the champions league . the shock was compounded when viewed within the context of the clubs that ribery turned down to move to germany .
after pledging his love for marseille and the desire to play in the champions league with the club , it appeared that only one of the biggest of the big boys could steal the coveted playmaker away - clubs on the order of real madrid , barcelona and manchester united . ribery 's snubbing of the likes of real , barca and united was always going to raise eyebrows – and questions .
what on earth had bayern offered one of the most sought-after players of that summer to come to the bundesliga , the poor , unglamorous relation of la liga and the premiership ?
surely if it had been a huge amount of money , these other suitors could have bettered the deal ? bayern hierarchy sell munich ambitions to ribery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave luca toni and ribery the munich hard sell " in the summer of 2007 , bayern changed their mind and suddenly started playing the same game as the other big clubs in europe , " patrick strasser , who has spent more than a decade on the bayern beat for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper told deutsche welle . " they spent a hell of a lot of money , especially for ribery , toni and klose .
they promised franck and the world champion toni they would try to reach at least the quarter-finals of the champions league every year and to invest in the squad from year to year . " independent soccer correspondent david hein believes that bayern 's ambitious plan for the future turned ribery 's head - but that the germans ’ pulling out the financial stops sealed the deal .

about 45,000-50,000 people have died and 300,000 have been made homeless , the un estimates . the us said it was sending 10,000 troops to the country while france said on friday it would urge creditors to speed efforts to cancel the impoverished caribbean nation 's debt . though the paris club of creditor nations agreed in july to clear haiti 's remaining $ 215 million debt to club members , the process can still take years to finalize . french finance minister christine lagarde said she asked members of the informal club to speed up the process .
the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

" biafra " was the taunt german children used for skinny kids in the late 60s - the term was synonymous with starvation .
it is now 40 years since the end of the biafra war , and nigeria 's future still hangs in the balance . the 60 's were an exciting time for africa as ghana , kenya , cameroon , tanzania , nigeria and many other newly independent countries looked forward to self-determination .
this soon changed for the most populous country , which went to war in 1967 , when the southeastern province of biafra declared independence from nigeria . the southeast , inhabited by members of the igbo tribe , was the most densely populated region of nigeria , so the igbos were " the biggest diaspora of any group in nigeria and had migrated to every crack and nook of nigeria , " dr. johannes harnischfeger , author of " democratization and islamic law : the sharia conflict in nigeria , " told deutsche welle . biafra 's declaration of independence led to backlashes against igbos in the rest of the country .
this in turn triggered reprisals against other ethnic groups in biafra .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biafra war led to a humanitarian crisis .
during the war , the nigerian federal government had the support of great britain and the soviet union while biafra was only recognized by four african countries , the vatican , and the world council of churches .
director of the east africa office at the heinrich böll foundation in nairobi , dr. axel harneit-sievers , told deutsche welle that " the us and germany 's neutral stance was a de facto support for the nigerian federal government given the military and humanitarian situation . "
at one point in the war , nigeria did not allow any humanitarian aid into biafra .
later , medical aid was allowed into the region , but food was not .
the biafra war ended on january 15 1970 , leaving over one million people dead .
religion and ethnicity in post-biafra war nigeria after the war , nigeria was divided into 36 states to try and minimize ethnic tension .
however , any attempt to separate religion and ethnicity in nigeria is fraught with problems .
so , even though the country experienced a wave of optimism and rapid development as a result of the 70 's oil boom , many igbos were still bitter .
according to harneit-sievers , " ethnic competition plays a bigger role than religion on the national level .
none of the three large ethnic groups -lrb- yoruba , hausa and igbo -rrb- has more than 30 percent of the overall population , so it is always necessary for someone who wants to become president of nigeria to forge regional ethnic coalitions to get support . "
in may 1999 , the yoruba military leader olusegun obasanjo was elected president in part because he was able to get 70 percent of igbo support .
according to harnischfeger , the igbos who had focused on democracy were soon disappointed with the government because they were underrepresented .
as a result , the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra -lrb- massob -rrb- was founded in september 1999 .
a good number of igbos are sympathetic to massob , and the party has a lot of support from the young who did not experience the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop arinze receiving funds for biafra .
religion continues to cause conflict in nigeria .
the growing support of massob among the igbo youth illustrates how they feel disenfranchised as a result of their ethnicity .
however , northerners -lrb- mostly hausa-fulani -rrb- perceive any political differences with the government or the south as religious .
most of them are muslim and suspicious of the government .
in 2000 , the implementation of sharia law in kaduna state led to clashes between muslims and christians that left more than 2,000 dead .
the 2002 miss world pageant led to further clashes between the two religions when journalist isioma daniel suggested in a newspaper article that the prophet muhammad would have married one of the competitors .
furthermore , events in other countries had an impact on the relationship between christians and muslims in nigeria .
harneit-sievers said one example was " the publication of the muslim caricature in a danish newspaper that also led to protests in northern nigeria . "
he added that such events " may translate into conflict and perhaps even counter attacks against muslims in the south . "
uncertain times ahead for nigeria today , the bigger issue facing nigeria is the health of president umaru yar 'adua .
both harnischfeger and harneit-sievers agree that this poses a problem .
it is hard to say whether the president , who was nicknamed " baba go slow " , brought many changes to the country , but he can be credited for the disarmament process in the niger delta , said harneit-sievers .
this program is currently in danger as a result of his health , and the uncertainty regarding who is actually ruling the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president umaru yar 'adua .
the recent protests in abuja shows that " the criticism is rising and it could end in a situation which would make it necessary to have a new president .
this poses its own problems because questions of ethnic balancing , regional background , power sharing , and so on , are involved , " harneit-sievers said .
the general discontent of the igbo with the government also makes secession a possibility .
nevertheless , harnischfeger feels that " it is not an option for the near future though many igbos are hoping for it . "
massob has a growing support among the young who believe that a separate state would usher in an era of more opportunities for the oil-rich state .
" so , if nigeria falls apart , then biafra may become a reality because of igbo bitterness , " he added .
however , harneit-sievers disagrees with the possiblity of another biafra secession and says that the support for massob among young igbos " reflects the desperation of the youth in nigeria .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .

the men wear leather trousers and the women have " dirndl " on - dresses with fitted bodices over white blouses with plunging necklines . this includes the bar 's manager , german immigrant reinhard wurtz , who claims that it is the loewenbraeu keller 's loyalty to bavarian tradition that has proven to be a formula for success . " we are the biggest authentic bavarian restaurant outside of germany , " said wurtz .
" most of the furnishings and decor here were imported from bavaria - and we cook real bavarian cuisine .
there are a few bavarian bars in other countries that are bigger in size , but after traveling around i can definitely say that ours is the most authentic . " bildunterschrift : the loewenbraeu keller is more relaxed than other bars in sydney , said ostermann no small beer mugs located in the rocks , a short walk from sydney harbor , the loewenbraeu keller is known to the locals as simply " the lowenbrau " -lrb- pronounced to rhyme with " how " -rrb- .
the bar and restaurant seats over 800 people in its outdoor and indoor areas . it was named after the famous bavarian beer , loewenbraeu , as the bar is its official australian importer .
established in 1976 by john szangolies , a sydney resident of german descent , it was meant to capitalize on bavaria 's worldwide fame for its food , drink and traditions like the oktoberfest .
today , the bar welcomes around one million visitors per year . apart from loewenbraeu , the bar also has other well-known german beers on offer , such as hofbraeu and paulaner .
this is certainly not the type of beer you would find at a typical australian pub - nor are the one-liter and half-liter beer steins something most australians would be familiar with , since the country 's standard serving size is smaller . for native south australian and first-time visitor to sydney luke polkinghorne , this " novelty factor " is what stood out to him when he entered the loewenbraeu keller .
it was also the first time he had ever drunk out of a one-liter beer mug . authentic outpost abroad the loewenbraeu keller 's " germanness " is more than costume-deep .
according to manager reinhard wurtz , the bar mostly hires people who can speak german , " so that they have some understanding of the culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann is n't from bavaria , but she adapts to the bavarian stereotype when she 's at work this means that the bar attracts a large number of backpackers from germany , austria and switzerland - as well as other european countries - who are looking for temporary work in australia .
one such traveler is 23-year-old isabell ostermann , from the small town of wittlich in south-western germany .
she traveled around australia and asia before settling down in sydney for the remaining five months of her year abroad . " when i came back from asia i had to find a job , and i thought the easiest way would be to go to a german restaurant , ” said ostermann .
" so i just walked right into the loewenbraeu keller and asked .
it was a very good time for that because it was one week before oktoberfest and they were very busy . " when asked about the authenticity of the bar from a german 's point of view , ostermann was full of enthusiasm . " it 's very german ! "
ostermann exclaimed .
" i sometimes forget that i 'm in australia .
it 's only the australian customers that remind me of where i am .
i feel so at home in here - it 's like being with my family . " although she is not from bavaria herself , ostermann admitted that she loves wearing the traditional dirndl all day and fitting the stereotypical image of a german - simply because it is " fun . " bildunterschrift : australians are n't used to such large servings of beer german-style fun apart from food and drink , the loewenbraeu keller also offers its guests daily live entertainment , from oom-pah-pah brass bands and alphorn performances to bavarian-style slap dancing .
there is also a dance floor and djs pumping out pop music , as well as fun activities that the visitors can get involved in , such as yodeling and drinking contests . " i have tried the beer-drinking competition here before , ” said jacqui salvage , a sydney resident and regular visitor to the loewenbraeu keller .
" but the european girls always beat me . " adding to this spirit of fun , the bar 's manager reinhard wurtz holds the guinness world record for carrying 20 one-liter steins of beer stacked up in his hands for a distance of over 40 meters .
this record was set on location at the loewenbraeu keller in november 2007 . " the atmosphere is more laid-back here than in many of sydney 's other bars , which tend to be quite fancy , " said bartender isabell ostermann .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 15.01.2010 head of stasi file archive says investigations are nowhere near end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police compiled a vast number of filed on its citizens twenty years ago thousands of protestors stormed the offices of east germany 's secret police , the stasi , looking for secret files on their lives .
deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

last year , italy 's top court overturned a law created by berlusconi to protect him from being prosecuted while in office . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was absent on friday for the first hearing of his corruption trial , in which he is accused of bribing a british lawyer to lie on the stand .

prosecutors accuse berlusconi of ordering the 1997 payment of $ 600,000 -lrb- 416,000 euros -rrb- to lawyer david mills in exchange for his false testimony at two hearings in other corruption cases .
mills was sentenced in february to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting the bribe .
he maintains his innocence and is currently appealing the conviction .

these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

but aid distribution continues to be hampered by logistics . governments around the world pledged to help haitians recover and rebuild their lives after tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake devastated the country .
about 45,000-50,000 people have died and 300,000 have been made homeless , the un estimates . the us said it was sending 10,000 troops to the country while france said on friday it would urge creditors to speed efforts to cancel the impoverished caribbean nation 's debt . though the paris club of creditor nations agreed in july to clear haiti 's remaining $ 215 million debt to club members , the process can still take years to finalize . french finance minister christine lagarde said she asked members of the informal club to speed up the process .
the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .

it will mark her first foreign trip since becoming the eu 's top diplomat , a post created by the lisbon treaty in december . eu , un contribute amid fears for their own the european commission has contributed three million euros -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- in initial aid to haiti but plans to increase that amount in the coming days .
spain , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency , has also contributed three million euros . ashton had earlier said that " a large number of european union citizens " , including a european commission staffer from spain , were unaccounted for . news agency afp reported that a 61-year-old austrian woman working for a german aid group had been killed by a falling wall .
french authorities had so far counted six of their nationals among the dead .
canada announced that 1,415 of its citizens were missing . united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said he would visit the devastated country “ very soon . ”
as of friday , 37 of the un ’ s personnel in haiti were confirmed dead .
about 330 un personnel are still missing or unaccounted for , out of some 12,000 the organization has in haiti . “ i myself will go to haiti very soon , both to show solidarity with the people of haiti and our u.n. staff and to assess the situation for myself , ” ban told reporters . ban also said that up to half of the buildings in the capital of port-au-prince and surrounding areas had been destroyed or severely damaged . us secretary of state , hillary clinton , has also announced that she will arrive in haiti on saturday . aid stymied by damaged infrastructure despite a flood of aid from countries around the world , many haitians remain desperate for food , clean water , shelter and medical care . “ no one is helping us .
please bring us water or people will die soon , ” resident renelde lamarque , who was hosting some 500 quake victims in his front yard , told reuters . the us aimed to have a thousand troops in haiti on friday , with a further 10,000 set to arrive by monday .
that will include 300 medical personnel , 3,500 soldiers , 2,200 marines , a hospital ship , and other ships carrying supplies . the cuban government has also pledged to allow us military flights to use its normally restricted airspace to evacuate quake victims . among the most anticipated military arrivals was that of american aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson , which can be used as a supply base to fly in goods to the many areas cut off by buckled roads and toppled buildings . as international aid pours in , blocked roads and damage to communication systems have made distributing it a major challenge .
furthermore , traffic jams at port-au-prince airport forced many planes to circle for up to two hours before landing .
haitians are reportedly angry about having to wait for days with no help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have much to give , but its taking longer than expected to reach haitian survivors " we 've been out here waiting for three days and three nights but nothing has been done for us , not even a word of encouragement from the president , " pierre jackson told reuters news agency as he tended to his mother and sister who lay whimpering with crushed legs .

but aid distribution continues to be hampered by logistics . governments around the world pledged to help haitians recover and rebuild their lives after tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake devastated the country .
about 45,000-50,000 people have died and 300,000 have been made homeless , the un estimates . the us said it was sending 10,000 troops to the country while france said on friday it would urge creditors to speed efforts to cancel the impoverished caribbean nation 's debt . though the paris club of creditor nations agreed in july to clear haiti 's remaining $ 215 million debt to club members , the process can still take years to finalize . french finance minister christine lagarde said she asked members of the informal club to speed up the process .
the next meeting is on wednesday . haiti " can count on europe " eu foreign affairs commissioner catherine ashton will chair a meeting of development ministers from the group ’ s 27 member countries on monday . “ i am absolutely committed to helping the people in haiti , ” ashton said in a statement .
“ that is what the people of haiti expect and they can count on us .
rebuilding haiti is now a priority for the eu . " ashton announced on thursday that european development ministers would hold emergency talks in brussels on monday to discuss how to assist haiti . " it 's important to tell the people of haiti that we stand ready to help them as much as we can in this tragedy .
they can count on europe , " said ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catherine ashton is the eu 's first foreign policy chief she also said the informal meeting on monday would allow eu ministers " to get a sense of what they are able to do much more effectively " by being in the same room . ashton also said she and us secretary of state hillary clinton would meet wednesday to " talk about many things " but that haiti would be a major focal point .
it will mark her first foreign trip since becoming the eu 's top diplomat , a post created by the lisbon treaty in december . eu , un contribute amid fears for their own the european commission has contributed three million euros -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- in initial aid to haiti but plans to increase that amount in the coming days .
spain , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency , has also contributed three million euros . ashton had earlier said that " a large number of european union citizens " , including a european commission staffer from spain , were unaccounted for . news agency afp reported that a 61-year-old austrian woman working for a german aid group had been killed by a falling wall .
french authorities had so far counted six of their nationals among the dead .
canada announced that 1,415 of its citizens were missing . united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said he would visit the devastated country “ very soon . ”
as of friday , 37 of the un ’ s personnel in haiti were confirmed dead .
about 330 un personnel are still missing or unaccounted for , out of some 12,000 the organization has in haiti . “ i myself will go to haiti very soon , both to show solidarity with the people of haiti and our u.n. staff and to assess the situation for myself , ” ban told reporters . ban also said that up to half of the buildings in the capital of port-au-prince and surrounding areas had been destroyed or severely damaged . us secretary of state , hillary clinton , has also announced that she will arrive in haiti on saturday . aid stymied by damaged infrastructure despite a flood of aid from countries around the world , many haitians remain desperate for food , clean water , shelter and medical care . “ no one is helping us .
please bring us water or people will die soon , ” resident renelde lamarque , who was hosting some 500 quake victims in his front yard , told reuters . the us aimed to have a thousand troops in haiti on friday , with a further 10,000 set to arrive by monday .
that will include 300 medical personnel , 3,500 soldiers , 2,200 marines , a hospital ship , and other ships carrying supplies . the cuban government has also pledged to allow us military flights to use its normally restricted airspace to evacuate quake victims . among the most anticipated military arrivals was that of american aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson , which can be used as a supply base to fly in goods to the many areas cut off by buckled roads and toppled buildings . as international aid pours in , blocked roads and damage to communication systems have made distributing it a major challenge .
furthermore , traffic jams at port-au-prince airport forced many planes to circle for up to two hours before landing .
haitians are reportedly angry about having to wait for days with no help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid groups have much to give , but its taking longer than expected to reach haitian survivors " we 've been out here waiting for three days and three nights but nothing has been done for us , not even a word of encouragement from the president , " pierre jackson told reuters news agency as he tended to his mother and sister who lay whimpering with crushed legs . " the level of supplies is going to get worse in the next few hours .
water , food and medicines are all urgently needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 15.01.2010 general motors unveils new top management at opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the management change is the latest in a long-running saga at opel us carmaker gm have announced the new management team for its troubled opel unit .
nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

nick reilly , already president of gm europe , takes the reins at opel and is tasked with pushing through a major restructuring plan . top general motors executive nick reilly has been named the new chief executive of germany 's opel as well as its sister concern , uk-based vauxhall , gm announced on friday .
reilly replaces hans demant , who will take on a new job overseeing intellectual property rights .
60-year-old reilly , who is british , is currently president of gm europe .
he takes on the top job as opel struggles to survive the severe crisis facing the auto industry .
a respected executive who has held a variety of posts in his 35-year career at the detroit-based carmaker , reilly is to unveil a major restructuring plan by the end of the month that could see up to 9,000 job cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly will have to face workers worried about their jobs " his most important quality is his flexibility , " christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
" he has done well in every position he 's held . "
stuermer and other analysts say reilly 's style , his ability to listen and delegate and his reputation as a tough but fair man when it comes to restructuring programs , make him a good choice for the job .
" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans demant , left , is leaving the top job at opel and nick reilly is taking over " reilly has done well in that he has generated sympathy instead of antipathy in berlin and among the public in the weeks after detroit announced it was keeping opel , " said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research at the university of duisburg-essen .
" he is a good communicator , which is important right now . "
in other personnel changes , mark james , also from the uk , will take over as chief financial officer .
rita forst , head of opel 's technical development center , was appointed head of engineering .
reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

" opel has a history of hatching restructuring plans that either have n't been implemented or have n't been successful , " said stuermer .
" opel very badly needs a successful strategy now to survive . "
the restructuring plan now being worked out is a necessary basis for gm in its negotiations with european governments over possible state support to help overhaul its opel operation .
gm has said saving opel will cost about 3.3 billion euros , and hopes to get 2.7 billion euros in state support .
long story the management change is the latest key development in the long-running saga of gm and opel .
general motors , itself struggling , had once announced it would sell its majority stake in the german unit as part of an overhaul of its global business .
a deal was worked out , backed by berlin , for a consortium headed by canadian auto parts maker magna to buy that stake .
but in november gm announced it would retail opel , a reversal which outraged workers and politicians in germany who feared massive job cuts .
reilly was able to step in and quell some of that anger .

reinald hoben takes over as head of production and alain visser will be opel 's sales and marketing chief .
the new board " will address tasks quickly and with plenty of energy , " reilly said in a statement .
" we in particular will be on the offensive and will want to increase our market share in europe . "
road ahead still rocky despite the new optimism , opel still faces considerable challenges .
on friday , data released by the european automobile manufacturers association showed open and vauxhall sales dropped 7.8 percent in 2009 .
opel also said on friday that around 12,000 of its workers , half of its domestic german workforce , will work fewer hours in january and february due to slumping sales .
a spokesman told afp it will represent a " few days " of unemployment per month .
" we are in an economic crisis and we have to adapt , " the spokesman added .
reilly will also have to convince opel 's workers ' council of the need to accept job cuts that the carmaker proposed in late december .
the council , which includes union officials , rejected the plan .
" the next few weeks in the european auto sector are going to be very interesting indeed , " said analyst stuermer .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '
these types of questions are always very similar , even if the dictatorships themselves are very different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty years ago , demonstrators smashed their way into stasi headquarters in berlin the debate over the future of your commission and over when files should be transferred into the national archives has intensified in recent years .
where is this discussion at the moment , and what would you like to see happen ?
there was consensus from the beginning that this commission would be a temporary and limited mechanism .
it was estimated when laws on the stasi documents were passed that the authority would be in existence for 10 , maximum 15 years .
but all who are involved share the belief that even 20 years after the peaceful revolution our tasks are still not finished and wo n't be for quite a while .
and the special nature of the files means they can not yet be placed in general archives .
demand for the files from different areas supports this .
a more important question addresses how the files can be best kept and administered in the future , and when would a transition to general archives be justifiable .
i estimate this will take time , but i do n't want to hypothesize on the outcome of this debate .

deutsche welle spoke with the commissioner now in charge of the archive . on january 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators stormed the headquarters of east germany 's infamous secret police - more commonly known as the stasi .
the protestors peacefully seized the myriad files that had been kept on their lives , helping end the decades of surveillance and informing upon suspect citizens that were the central tasks of the agency .
deutsche welle spoke with marianne birthler , who is the commissioner for the stasi archives .
birthler leads government efforts to protect the stasi files and investigate the past crimes of the east german secret police .
deutsche welle : there was a surprising level of resistance by politicians , including then chancellor helmut kohl , against the opening of the stasi files .
as a result , even in september 1990 , still a few weeks prior to the official ending of the reunification process , there were demonstrations and vigils being held at the stasi headquarters here in berlin .
was this a surprising political development within the context of german reunification ?
marianne birthler : well , everything that was new and that did not correspond to the normal procedures of the federal government , had been troublesome during the reunification process .
and therefore it was assumed that following reunification when it came to the stasi files the federal government would do what it does with all state files : that they would be put into government archives and would be inaccessible for a few decades .
this was not what we wanted .
so there was resistance .
perhaps the authorities were afraid because there would be information that would be released which ordinarily would not have come to be published .
and so there had to be some pressure applied so that the files would be opened along with german reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler helped set up a network for investigating the past east germany 's secret police the ministry for state security in east germany was an important intelligence service insofar as the intelligence system in the eastern bloc was concerned .
here in berlin , 20 years ago , the stasi headquarters were stormed by demonstrators in a manner that did not occur in other countries at the time .
how do you explain this ?
well , actually there were other developments in other countries , though overall the whole issue of the secret police developed elsewhere much later as a public matter .
it concerned political parties and those in power .
but it was n't due to the fact that opposition in other countries was any weaker than in germany , quite the opposite .
in poland for example , there was very strong opposition , but the situation that existed there developed very differently .
even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them .
in the meantime , there are similar institutions -lrb- to the german stasi commission -rrb- in poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , romania .
we are always working in close contact .
more than a year ago , you helped initiate a network between germany and six former eastern bloc countries to help improve access to communist secret police files .
could this model be applied in other regions of the world , for example in some latin american and asian countries , where dictators still hold power ?
i was invited only last summer to brazil for a conference on exactly this question .
there were also representatives from countries such as argentina and chile , which reported on their efforts to come to terms with dictatorships , and this , if i 'm correctly informed , was the first time that a trans-south american discourse on the subject had been held .
there has also been an intensified global trend towards a debate over the question , ' how do we deal with toppled dictatorships ? '
we also have guests coming not only from former communist countries , but from iraq , from latin america , from spain , from cambodia , trying to find out what we 're doing here .
it does n't only concern the legacy of the secret police , but also other important questions : ' how is it for the victims ? , ' ' what are the needs of the victims ? , ' ' what do you do with the perpetrators ? , ' ' how do you heal a damaged society ? '

more than 10 years after military dictator suharto was forced to leave office , the armed forces still control a considerable business empire .
behind the scenes , they also retain a say in politics . in 2004 , indonesia passed a law that was designed to strengthen civilian rule after the end of the suharto era .
the law stipulated that the military should give up all its commercial enterprises by the end of 2009 .
but nothing like that has happened , says lisa misol , the author of a recent study by human rights watch .
“ we think that it is time for civilian authorities really to take seriously their responsibility as leaders , and to understand that under the law , they have to exercise control , and that the armed forces have said they 'll follow the civilian leaders , ” misol says .
“ this is an opportunity to put that to the test and really exercise authority that they have under the law , and to remove from the military these independent sources of power that are dangerous for indonesia 's government and for the people because of the human rights abuses and the impunity that they help to fuel . "
lack of accountability facilitates corruption a lack of accountability facilitates corruption and other crimes in sectors such as timber .
the army 's role in the country ’ s private security services has also become controversial .
they have been accused of extorting money .
a former defence minister admitted last year that " rogue elements " in the military could be behind the killing of gold mine employees in papua province .
the army and politicians have traditionally justified the involvement of the military in business with the need to raise more money for troops .
lisa misol rejects this , pointing to an increase in the defence budget over the years .
“ these businesses are not helping soldier welfare , contrary to the claims , ” she says .
“ they really are benefitting the elite military officers , and the soldiers really need to be benefitting from funds that come from the government and are subject to democratic accountability of the parliament ! "
government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

government reluctant to alienate army aurel croissant , a political scientist at the university of heidelberg who specialises in civil-military relations in indonesia , thinks the government is reluctant to alienate the armed forces .
“ although indonesia has been a quite successful case of democratisation in southeast asia and the asia-pacific in general , the military still is a powerful and important domestic player .
every government in indonesia has to take into account the interests of the military , " croissant says .
besides its business operations , the army also retains a limited influence in some policy fields , such as defence and security .
however , aurel croissant insists that the military is not an alternative power centre in indonesia .
" it is more like a network system and not so much a coherent institutionalized system which would mean the real political power in the country is the military - that is not the case !
it is not like thailand , where we have a military para-state since 2006 . "
as long as they can make some extra money , indonesia ’ s army officers seem committed to democracy and nobody is afraid of a new coup in indonesia .
an important reason why the indonesian government is being slow in its efforts to reform military businesses is that it does not want to jeopardise the equilibrium between the interests of the civilian and military elites .

the government has recently had to defend it against the protestant church , which wants troops to be removed immediately .
now the governor of kunduz where some 4,200 german troops are stationed has repeated his criticism that they are not doing enough , and are battle-shy . the governor of kunduz province , mohammad omar , is not known for his praise of the bundeswehr ’ s operation in afghanistan .
his criticism has just grown even sharper .
now he says the german troops in his region have become completely ineffective .
" when the germans first came here , they were very effective in the region - building roads , clinics , bridges and schools .
but the situation is very different today .
it has got much worse .
the germans are weak in terms of changing the security situation .
we have an enemy that wants to kill us .
we also have friends but if one friend can ’ t help us , we have to turn to another , ” he recently said .
the other friend is basically the united states and the governor is glad that president barack obama has ordered a troop surge .
he wants 3,000 of the new troops to be posted in his province .
this way , he says , the germans can concentrate on the areas in the north that are less restive .
insurgents should be “ killed ” the governor does not beat about the bush .
he thinks that the germans can not do anything against the insurgents in kunduz unless they kill them .
" the reconstruction team in kunduz is presumably trained to fight the enemy but the german government doesn ’ t want that unfortunately .
germany doesn ’ t want its soldiers to die .
but we have a responsibility towards our people here .
we have to get rid of the insurgents and we need security .
we want the german government to see the reality here and want it allow its soldiers to act effectively . ”
omar approved the strikes on two oil tanks last september , which were ordered by the german military command , after it reported that the tanks had been hijacked by the taliban .
however , dozens of civilians died in the strikes and the incident triggered a widespread debate in germany that led to the resignation of labour minister franz-josef jung , who had been the defence minister at the time of the attack .
german troops defend kunduz operations however , the governor of kunduz would like to see more such offensives .
overall , he thinks , the security situation has only improved in kunduz because of the afghan security forces and the us troops .
for the german soldiers who risk their lives daily in kunduz , these are harsh words to swallow .
jürgen mertins , the press officer for the kunduz reconstruction team , says that there has been good cooperation with the afghan security forces “ in the past few months and we have carried out a whole series of operations .
we believe that the security situation in kunduz has improved because of this . “ governor omar ’ s call for the bundeswehr to be more effective comes as the debate rages in germany about whether troops should be in afghanistan at all .
the head of the protestant church recently said there was “ nothing good ” about the operation .
