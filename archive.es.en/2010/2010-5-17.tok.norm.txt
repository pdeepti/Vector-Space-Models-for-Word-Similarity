on sunday , a temporary fix was found for the problem . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions i was wondering why do n't they crimp the leaking tube ?
this could be accomplished with a metal scissor using two oil compression pistons on each side .
or another possibility is to put an expansion cylinder in the leaking tube and activate the pressure when the cylinder is inside the leaking tube .
or another suggestion is to make the leaking tube so cold from the outside using , for example liquid nitrogen or helium , and this would slowly freeze the inner walls of the leaking tube until the tube would be completely frozen and then weld some round metal around the borders at the end of the leaking tube . - andrea , czech republic fabricate and deploy a welded , steel rod-reinforced concrete inverted funnel .
it should have a slotted bottom opening for straddling the existing leaking well pipe .
connect it vertically with siphon tubing from a collection oil tanker . - deane , us if you where to make a 1,000 pound arrow -lrb- as in bow and arrow -rrb- and put a high density steel umbrella device on the end and then stuff it into the pipe , the oil pressure pushing back on the arrow would cause the umbrella device to wedge itself into the pipe .
also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution .

as a result of the economic crisis , the government has no money to pay their salaries , but the railway company in the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina is investing millions of euros in new high-speed trains to help shorten the 450-kilometer -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- trip from sarajevo via croatia to belgrade to four hours , dzumhur says .

engines and crew change at every border , including the frontier between the two parts of bosnia .
the trip takes eight hours and 45 minutes and costs under 17 euros -lrb- $ 21,60 -rrb- one way .
" from an economic point of view , this train does n't make any sense , " says conductor hajrudin .
" it is not profitable . " there are n't enough passengers to cover the cost of the trip from sarajevo to belgrade , the war veteran adds .
" this train is more about politics and makes sense as an effort to build bridges between people . "

he leaves the train in doboj , where bosnian-serb colleagues take over , and a new engine is hitched to the cars .
the train usually has three cars , one each from the bosniak-croat , the bosnian-serb and serb train companies .
due to the strike , the bosniak-croat car is missing that day as the train pulls out of the station .
memories of the olympic express only about a dozen passengers are on board a train that can carry at least 150 people .
in the restaurant car , chef rade reminisces about the past .
" the older passengers remember the days when this train was always packed .
people still had jobs then . "
that was in the 1980s , when yugoslavia was doing well and sarajevo hosted the 1984 olympic winter games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.05.2010 italian art group campaigns to recover long-lost caravaggio painting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real version of caravaggio 's " the nativity " may be with the mafia some 50,000 art thefts are reported each year and nearly all involve organized criminals .
the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 17.05.2010 reconciliation train brings bosnians and serbs together - theoretically großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : railway managers hope trains will boost ties trains between sarajevo in bosnia and herzegovina and belgrade in serbia have been running again these past six months - one of the most visible efforts at reconciliation after the bosnian war that ended 15 years ago . with a cigarette and a cup of coffee in hand , narcis dzumhur , chief executive of the bosnian railway in sarajevo , announces the cancellation of the train to belgrade on the following day . dzumhur explains that the employees will be on strike , which is no surprise since they have n't been paid .
as a result of the economic crisis , the government has no money to pay their salaries , but the railway company in the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina is investing millions of euros in new high-speed trains to help shorten the 450-kilometer -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- trip from sarajevo via croatia to belgrade to four hours , dzumhur says .
" we want to reunite families who were scattered by the war and facilitate ties between businessmen in bosnia and herzegovina , croatia and serbia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarajevo - the starting point for a long journey the trains run from the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina through the bosnian-serb entity , into eastern croatia and finally to the serbian capital , belgrade .
engines and crew change at every border , including the frontier between the two parts of bosnia .
the trip takes eight hours and 45 minutes and costs under 17 euros -lrb- $ 21,60 -rrb- one way .
" from an economic point of view , this train does n't make any sense , " says conductor hajrudin .
" it is not profitable . " there are n't enough passengers to cover the cost of the trip from sarajevo to belgrade , the war veteran adds .
" this train is more about politics and makes sense as an effort to build bridges between people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train restaurant chef rade faces an empty dining room hajrudin has never made the journey all the way from sarajevo to belgrade .
he leaves the train in doboj , where bosnian-serb colleagues take over , and a new engine is hitched to the cars .
the train usually has three cars , one each from the bosniak-croat , the bosnian-serb and serb train companies .
due to the strike , the bosniak-croat car is missing that day as the train pulls out of the station .
memories of the olympic express only about a dozen passengers are on board a train that can carry at least 150 people .
in the restaurant car , chef rade reminisces about the past .
" the older passengers remember the days when this train was always packed .
people still had jobs then . "
that was in the 1980s , when yugoslavia was doing well and sarajevo hosted the 1984 olympic winter games .
the elegant " olympic express " took businessmen and tourists to belgrade and back .
fifteen years after the end of the war in bosnia , almost no one takes the train from sarajevo all the way to belgrade any more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine hours later - belgrade belgrade peace activist nenad vukosavljevic remains unconvinced by the symbolism of a train that joins the two capitals . " it is sad that the train takes so long for the journey and has to change engines so many times , " vukosavljevic says .
" that really is an admission of failure .
i would n't want to use that as a measuring stick for the state of relations between our countries . "

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .

one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .

bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "

people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions i was wondering why do n't they crimp the leaking tube ?
this could be accomplished with a metal scissor using two oil compression pistons on each side .
or another possibility is to put an expansion cylinder in the leaking tube and activate the pressure when the cylinder is inside the leaking tube .
or another suggestion is to make the leaking tube so cold from the outside using , for example liquid nitrogen or helium , and this would slowly freeze the inner walls of the leaking tube until the tube would be completely frozen and then weld some round metal around the borders at the end of the leaking tube . - andrea , czech republic fabricate and deploy a welded , steel rod-reinforced concrete inverted funnel .
it should have a slotted bottom opening for straddling the existing leaking well pipe .
connect it vertically with siphon tubing from a collection oil tanker . - deane , us if you where to make a 1,000 pound arrow -lrb- as in bow and arrow -rrb- and put a high density steel umbrella device on the end and then stuff it into the pipe , the oil pressure pushing back on the arrow would cause the umbrella device to wedge itself into the pipe .
also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .

one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .

one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .

she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman guards at a kindergarten in order to protect children in qingdao city jie song says auto-aggression is much more common among patients than aggression towards others , especially towards children .
but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

on sunday , a temporary fix was found for the problem . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions i was wondering why do n't they crimp the leaking tube ?
this could be accomplished with a metal scissor using two oil compression pistons on each side .
or another possibility is to put an expansion cylinder in the leaking tube and activate the pressure when the cylinder is inside the leaking tube .
or another suggestion is to make the leaking tube so cold from the outside using , for example liquid nitrogen or helium , and this would slowly freeze the inner walls of the leaking tube until the tube would be completely frozen and then weld some round metal around the borders at the end of the leaking tube . - andrea , czech republic fabricate and deploy a welded , steel rod-reinforced concrete inverted funnel .
it should have a slotted bottom opening for straddling the existing leaking well pipe .
connect it vertically with siphon tubing from a collection oil tanker . - deane , us if you where to make a 1,000 pound arrow -lrb- as in bow and arrow -rrb- and put a high density steel umbrella device on the end and then stuff it into the pipe , the oil pressure pushing back on the arrow would cause the umbrella device to wedge itself into the pipe .
also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .

but few were seen leaving the camp at rajprasong – an upmarket commercial and retail location in central bangkok that they have occupied since april 3 , paralyzing normal business .
the deadline was then extended before the thai security forces prepared to move into the area .
up to 30,000 troops have been deployed around the city to retake the rajprasong protest site .
renegade general dies from gunshot wound clashes between the protesters and military forces escalated over the weekend with the death toll from three days of military operations rising to 36 , including the death monday of a renegade army major general khattiya sawasdiphol from a gunshot wound he received last week .
the general , also known as seh daeng , sided with the protesters and had overseen security at their camp .
bildunterschrift : in this photo taken on may 8 , renegade general khattiya sawasdiphol greets anti-government supporters .
the general , who was shot by an unidentified sniper , died from his wounds on monday since the protests began in mid-march 65 people have died and another 1,600 have been injured .

government declares holidays around the areas where checkpoints were to be set up , smoke billowed from burning rubber tires on the main roads .
the five star dusit thansi hotel , located near red shirt barricades in the financial district of silom road , was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade late sunday .
due to the violence , the government was forced to declare public holidays on monday and tuesday .
schools were also closed .
bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters still dance to live music though numbers have fallen efforts on for last-minute talks the growing threat of further violence led to efforts late monday for new talks between the red shirt leaders and the government .
kudeb saikrajang , a member of the opposition puea thai party that has been supporting the red shirt movement , said , " the red shirt leaders asked for negotiations and they have no conditions .
i think the government should accept that if they are not bloody minded .
negotiations are the only way out . "
kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .
they say the troubles remain an internal affair .
thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .
diplomatic sources say the thai army is preparing operations to be launched tuesday to retake the rajprasong area unless overnight talks succeed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 17.05.2010 germany will be forced to improvise with ballack out for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will be on crutches for the coming weeks the german national team 's nightmare has come true , with captain michael ballack out of commission for south africa .
so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .

ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .

but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks also look at how to include muslim religious instruction in schools the interior ministry has said that the conference would focus on gender equality , preventing the rise of extremism , and the introduction of islamic religion classes in schools .
german students in public schools can choose to take courses in roman catholic , protestant , jewish or , as part of an ongoing pilot program , muslim studies .
in march , interior minister thomas de maiziere said he would exclude another organization , the islam council , from the talks .
leaders of one of the dominant groups in that council , milli gorus , are under investigation for tax fraud and misuse of funds , and it has been accused of supporting a fundamentalist brand of islam .
a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .
green party co-chairman cem oezdemir told germany 's epd news agency on sunday that the body risked becoming a " mere tea party . "
he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .
" we need a road map with concrete requirements that muslim organizations must fulfill in order to obtain recognition as a religious community , " oezdemir said. svs / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .
the fdp supports the idea of an all-volunteer , professional army and wants to do away with conscription. gb / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks also look at how to include muslim religious instruction in schools the interior ministry has said that the conference would focus on gender equality , preventing the rise of extremism , and the introduction of islamic religion classes in schools .
german students in public schools can choose to take courses in roman catholic , protestant , jewish or , as part of an ongoing pilot program , muslim studies .
in march , interior minister thomas de maiziere said he would exclude another organization , the islam council , from the talks .
leaders of one of the dominant groups in that council , milli gorus , are under investigation for tax fraud and misuse of funds , and it has been accused of supporting a fundamentalist brand of islam .
a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .
green party co-chairman cem oezdemir told germany 's epd news agency on sunday that the body risked becoming a " mere tea party . "
he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .
" we need a road map with concrete requirements that muslim organizations must fulfill in order to obtain recognition as a religious community , " oezdemir said. svs / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .

the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 17.05.2010 germany will be forced to improvise with ballack out for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will be on crutches for the coming weeks the german national team 's nightmare has come true , with captain michael ballack out of commission for south africa .
so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .
etfs are also a good way to invest in commodities , like gold .
" without an etf , i only have the option of buying gold coins , stash them away and hope no one burgles me - or i need a safe , " says cabras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors can use etfs to buy gold without physical ownership germany is europe 's etf trading hub deutsche boerse , the german stock exchange in frankfurt , is the main trading hub for etfs in europe .
its xetra trading platform has a market share of 41 percent .
while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade in etfs in germany is worth 13 billion euros per day fund manager fatigue the popularity of etfs can in part be explained by investors ' disappointment in actively-managed funds , which often struggle to outperform a benchmark index .
according to a recent study by gecam , an independent financial services provider that analyzed thousands of funds all over europe , three in four managed funds mirrored indices by up to 90 percent over the last three years .
critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .

" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .
that means the shares in the dax are n't actually being bought for the etf - the money is invested elsewhere through those swaps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 17.05.2010 germany will be forced to improvise with ballack out for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will be on crutches for the coming weeks the german national team 's nightmare has come true , with captain michael ballack out of commission for south africa .
so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 17.05.2010 germany will be forced to improvise with ballack out for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will be on crutches for the coming weeks the german national team 's nightmare has come true , with captain michael ballack out of commission for south africa .
so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .

" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .
the fdp supports the idea of an all-volunteer , professional army and wants to do away with conscription. gb / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medical workers take an injured child to hospital in hanzhong city after an attack on the same day of his execution , a similar attack was carried out in a kindergarten in southern china , injuring 16 .
one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .
some of the culprits showed signs of behavioral disorders , but they were not noticed in time or they did n't receive the help or support they needed . "
bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman guards at a kindergarten in order to protect children in qingdao city jie song says auto-aggression is much more common among patients than aggression towards others , especially towards children .
but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medical workers take an injured child to hospital in hanzhong city after an attack on the same day of his execution , a similar attack was carried out in a kindergarten in southern china , injuring 16 .
one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .
some of the culprits showed signs of behavioral disorders , but they were not noticed in time or they did n't receive the help or support they needed . "
bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman guards at a kindergarten in order to protect children in qingdao city jie song says auto-aggression is much more common among patients than aggression towards others , especially towards children .
but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

on sunday , a temporary fix was found for the problem . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions i was wondering why do n't they crimp the leaking tube ?
this could be accomplished with a metal scissor using two oil compression pistons on each side .
or another possibility is to put an expansion cylinder in the leaking tube and activate the pressure when the cylinder is inside the leaking tube .
or another suggestion is to make the leaking tube so cold from the outside using , for example liquid nitrogen or helium , and this would slowly freeze the inner walls of the leaking tube until the tube would be completely frozen and then weld some round metal around the borders at the end of the leaking tube . - andrea , czech republic fabricate and deploy a welded , steel rod-reinforced concrete inverted funnel .
it should have a slotted bottom opening for straddling the existing leaking well pipe .
connect it vertically with siphon tubing from a collection oil tanker . - deane , us if you where to make a 1,000 pound arrow -lrb- as in bow and arrow -rrb- and put a high density steel umbrella device on the end and then stuff it into the pipe , the oil pressure pushing back on the arrow would cause the umbrella device to wedge itself into the pipe .
also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .

as a result of the economic crisis , the government has no money to pay their salaries , but the railway company in the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina is investing millions of euros in new high-speed trains to help shorten the 450-kilometer -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- trip from sarajevo via croatia to belgrade to four hours , dzumhur says .

the train usually has three cars , one each from the bosniak-croat , the bosnian-serb and serb train companies .
due to the strike , the bosniak-croat car is missing that day as the train pulls out of the station .

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 17.05.2010 germany will be forced to improvise with ballack out for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will be on crutches for the coming weeks the german national team 's nightmare has come true , with captain michael ballack out of commission for south africa .
so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .

up to 30,000 troops have been deployed around the city to retake the rajprasong protest site .
renegade general dies from gunshot wound clashes between the protesters and military forces escalated over the weekend with the death toll from three days of military operations rising to 36 , including the death monday of a renegade army major general khattiya sawasdiphol from a gunshot wound he received last week .

kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .

thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .

about half of them are german citizens .

he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .

but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .

a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .
green party co-chairman cem oezdemir told germany 's epd news agency on sunday that the body risked becoming a " mere tea party . "
he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .

deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .

the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

central europe has remained unaffected for the time being . a fresh ash cloud from the icelandic volcano , eyjafjallajokull , which forced the closure of airports overnight across britain , ireland , and the netherlands , has moved on , allowing passenger and cargo flights to resume .
london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest , had closed at midnight gmt on sunday but re-opened hours later under restrictions from the uk 's national air traffic service -lrb- nats -rrb- .
dutch authorities said amsterdam 's schiphol airport , europe 's third largest cargo hub and fifth biggest passenger terminus , re-opened ahead of schedule at noon local time on monday .
other airports affected by the flight ban included rotterdam in the netherlands ; dublin , sligo and donegal in ireland ; and manchester and liverpool in england . of those , only rotterdam has re-opened .
germany was unaffected by the ash cloud , with authorities saying early on monday that pollution in german airspace was " weak . "
results of german test flights a series of tests carried out by germany 's flagship carrier lufthansa ended on sunday after a six-hour flight designed to measure volcanic ash concentrations in european airspace .
the tests were conducted with a specially modified airbus a340-600 .
the plane flew with a battery of climate research instruments , which collected data from sensors mounted on the plane 's fuselage .
results are not expected until later on monday , at the earliest . the fresh meteorological data is to be used to help determine the risk for airplanes , should ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano return to central europe .
initial results from german aviation officials suggest german airspace will be spared from the ash cloud in the coming week . bildunterschrift : so far , german airspace remains open airspace closures controversial lufthansa conducted a similar flight on april 20 in the middle of a chaotic week for european air travel .
the initial ash cloud grounded tens of thousands of flights across the continent for nearly a week , leading to the largest airspace shutdown since world war ii .
the closure of airspace was widely criticized by airlines who said that not enough data had been collected to justify an outright closure .
british airways chief willie walsh condemned sunday 's airspace closures as a " gross overreaction to a very minor risk . "
walsh called for a better approach to dealing with the ash problem .
the travel disruptions cost the airlines millions in lost revenues each day .
with the planes grounded , airports likewise suffered financially and tourists and passengers remained stranded for days .
italy 's civil aviation agency has fined irish airline ryanair 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- for failing to aid passengers stranded during the travel disruptions .
the agency said ryanair did n't give 178 passengers mandatory assistance such as food , drink and lodgings while stranded in rome from april 15 to 22. acb / svs / gb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .

but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks also look at how to include muslim religious instruction in schools the interior ministry has said that the conference would focus on gender equality , preventing the rise of extremism , and the introduction of islamic religion classes in schools .
german students in public schools can choose to take courses in roman catholic , protestant , jewish or , as part of an ongoing pilot program , muslim studies .
in march , interior minister thomas de maiziere said he would exclude another organization , the islam council , from the talks .
leaders of one of the dominant groups in that council , milli gorus , are under investigation for tax fraud and misuse of funds , and it has been accused of supporting a fundamentalist brand of islam .
a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .
green party co-chairman cem oezdemir told germany 's epd news agency on sunday that the body risked becoming a " mere tea party . "
he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .
" we need a road map with concrete requirements that muslim organizations must fulfill in order to obtain recognition as a religious community , " oezdemir said. svs / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

central europe has remained unaffected for the time being . a fresh ash cloud from the icelandic volcano , eyjafjallajokull , which forced the closure of airports overnight across britain , ireland , and the netherlands , has moved on , allowing passenger and cargo flights to resume .
london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest , had closed at midnight gmt on sunday but re-opened hours later under restrictions from the uk 's national air traffic service -lrb- nats -rrb- .
dutch authorities said amsterdam 's schiphol airport , europe 's third largest cargo hub and fifth biggest passenger terminus , re-opened ahead of schedule at noon local time on monday .
other airports affected by the flight ban included rotterdam in the netherlands ; dublin , sligo and donegal in ireland ; and manchester and liverpool in england . of those , only rotterdam has re-opened .
germany was unaffected by the ash cloud , with authorities saying early on monday that pollution in german airspace was " weak . "
results of german test flights a series of tests carried out by germany 's flagship carrier lufthansa ended on sunday after a six-hour flight designed to measure volcanic ash concentrations in european airspace .
the tests were conducted with a specially modified airbus a340-600 .
the plane flew with a battery of climate research instruments , which collected data from sensors mounted on the plane 's fuselage .
results are not expected until later on monday , at the earliest . the fresh meteorological data is to be used to help determine the risk for airplanes , should ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano return to central europe .
initial results from german aviation officials suggest german airspace will be spared from the ash cloud in the coming week . bildunterschrift : so far , german airspace remains open airspace closures controversial lufthansa conducted a similar flight on april 20 in the middle of a chaotic week for european air travel .
the initial ash cloud grounded tens of thousands of flights across the continent for nearly a week , leading to the largest airspace shutdown since world war ii .
the closure of airspace was widely criticized by airlines who said that not enough data had been collected to justify an outright closure .
british airways chief willie walsh condemned sunday 's airspace closures as a " gross overreaction to a very minor risk . "
walsh called for a better approach to dealing with the ash problem .
the travel disruptions cost the airlines millions in lost revenues each day .
with the planes grounded , airports likewise suffered financially and tourists and passengers remained stranded for days .
italy 's civil aviation agency has fined irish airline ryanair 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- for failing to aid passengers stranded during the travel disruptions .
the agency said ryanair did n't give 178 passengers mandatory assistance such as food , drink and lodgings while stranded in rome from april 15 to 22. acb / svs / gb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the conflict over iran 's nuclear ambitions un agrees to new sanctions as iran continues to mock restrictions iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom us and partners react quickly to iran 's uranium deal with new sanctions international community weighs response to nuclear iran iran -pipe- 17.05.2010 iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is hoping to avoid new un sanctions through the deal hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step toward solving the on-going stand-off . the deal , agreed during a trilateral meeting between the iranian , turkish and brazilian leaders in iran over the weekend , will see iran 's stocks of enriched uranium processed into fuel rods in turkey and returned for use in tehran 's civilian nuclear energy program .
the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step towards solving the on-going stand-off .
-lrb- 17.05.2010 -rrb- future of non-proliferation efforts at stake at treaty review conference representatives from the 189 signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- began a month-long review conference on monday at the united nations headquarters in new york .
-lrb- 03.05.2010 -rrb- iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom this weekend iran holds a conference aimed at showing its commitment to a peaceful nuclear program .
but western powers have held talks on further sanctions as china softens its resistance to new measures .

the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "

but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks also look at how to include muslim religious instruction in schools the interior ministry has said that the conference would focus on gender equality , preventing the rise of extremism , and the introduction of islamic religion classes in schools .
german students in public schools can choose to take courses in roman catholic , protestant , jewish or , as part of an ongoing pilot program , muslim studies .
in march , interior minister thomas de maiziere said he would exclude another organization , the islam council , from the talks .
leaders of one of the dominant groups in that council , milli gorus , are under investigation for tax fraud and misuse of funds , and it has been accused of supporting a fundamentalist brand of islam .
a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .
green party co-chairman cem oezdemir told germany 's epd news agency on sunday that the body risked becoming a " mere tea party . "
he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.05.2010 second german islam conference begins amid criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between 3.8 million and 4.2 million muslims live in germany the second german islam conference brings together 34 individuals and groups representing both government bodies and muslims .
but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks also look at how to include muslim religious instruction in schools the interior ministry has said that the conference would focus on gender equality , preventing the rise of extremism , and the introduction of islamic religion classes in schools .
german students in public schools can choose to take courses in roman catholic , protestant , jewish or , as part of an ongoing pilot program , muslim studies .
in march , interior minister thomas de maiziere said he would exclude another organization , the islam council , from the talks .
leaders of one of the dominant groups in that council , milli gorus , are under investigation for tax fraud and misuse of funds , and it has been accused of supporting a fundamentalist brand of islam .
a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .
green party co-chairman cem oezdemir told germany 's epd news agency on sunday that the body risked becoming a " mere tea party . "
he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .
" we need a road map with concrete requirements that muslim organizations must fulfill in order to obtain recognition as a religious community , " oezdemir said. svs / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .
the fdp supports the idea of an all-volunteer , professional army and wants to do away with conscription. gb / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .

but few were seen leaving the camp at rajprasong – an upmarket commercial and retail location in central bangkok that they have occupied since april 3 , paralyzing normal business .
the deadline was then extended before the thai security forces prepared to move into the area .
up to 30,000 troops have been deployed around the city to retake the rajprasong protest site .
renegade general dies from gunshot wound clashes between the protesters and military forces escalated over the weekend with the death toll from three days of military operations rising to 36 , including the death monday of a renegade army major general khattiya sawasdiphol from a gunshot wound he received last week .
the general , also known as seh daeng , sided with the protesters and had overseen security at their camp .

the general , who was shot by an unidentified sniper , died from his wounds on monday since the protests began in mid-march 65 people have died and another 1,600 have been injured .
panitan wattanayagorn , a thai government spokesman , expressed concern over the loss of life .
" we are very concerned and the operation will be adjusted as we face strong resistance from several groups of people attacking the checkpoints .
it is very unusual to have groups of people with weapons attacking the checkpoints .
this is not a normal situation . "
government declares holidays around the areas where checkpoints were to be set up , smoke billowed from burning rubber tires on the main roads .

due to the violence , the government was forced to declare public holidays on monday and tuesday .

kudeb saikrajang , a member of the opposition puea thai party that has been supporting the red shirt movement , said , " the red shirt leaders asked for negotiations and they have no conditions .
i think the government should accept that if they are not bloody minded .
negotiations are the only way out . "
kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .
they say the troubles remain an internal affair .
thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .
diplomatic sources say the thai army is preparing operations to be launched tuesday to retake the rajprasong area unless overnight talks succeed .

but few were seen leaving the camp at rajprasong – an upmarket commercial and retail location in central bangkok that they have occupied since april 3 , paralyzing normal business .
the deadline was then extended before the thai security forces prepared to move into the area .
up to 30,000 troops have been deployed around the city to retake the rajprasong protest site .
renegade general dies from gunshot wound clashes between the protesters and military forces escalated over the weekend with the death toll from three days of military operations rising to 36 , including the death monday of a renegade army major general khattiya sawasdiphol from a gunshot wound he received last week .
the general , also known as seh daeng , sided with the protesters and had overseen security at their camp .
bildunterschrift : in this photo taken on may 8 , renegade general khattiya sawasdiphol greets anti-government supporters .
the general , who was shot by an unidentified sniper , died from his wounds on monday since the protests began in mid-march 65 people have died and another 1,600 have been injured .
panitan wattanayagorn , a thai government spokesman , expressed concern over the loss of life .

the five star dusit thansi hotel , located near red shirt barricades in the financial district of silom road , was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade late sunday .
due to the violence , the government was forced to declare public holidays on monday and tuesday .

bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters still dance to live music though numbers have fallen efforts on for last-minute talks the growing threat of further violence led to efforts late monday for new talks between the red shirt leaders and the government .
kudeb saikrajang , a member of the opposition puea thai party that has been supporting the red shirt movement , said , " the red shirt leaders asked for negotiations and they have no conditions .
i think the government should accept that if they are not bloody minded .
negotiations are the only way out . "
kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .
they say the troubles remain an internal affair .
thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .
diplomatic sources say the thai army is preparing operations to be launched tuesday to retake the rajprasong area unless overnight talks succeed .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medical workers take an injured child to hospital in hanzhong city after an attack on the same day of his execution , a similar attack was carried out in a kindergarten in southern china , injuring 16 .
one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .

her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "

people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medical workers take an injured child to hospital in hanzhong city after an attack on the same day of his execution , a similar attack was carried out in a kindergarten in southern china , injuring 16 .
one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .
some of the culprits showed signs of behavioral disorders , but they were not noticed in time or they did n't receive the help or support they needed . "
bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman guards at a kindergarten in order to protect children in qingdao city jie song says auto-aggression is much more common among patients than aggression towards others , especially towards children .
but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

as a result of the economic crisis , the government has no money to pay their salaries , but the railway company in the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina is investing millions of euros in new high-speed trains to help shorten the 450-kilometer -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- trip from sarajevo via croatia to belgrade to four hours , dzumhur says .

the train usually has three cars , one each from the bosniak-croat , the bosnian-serb and serb train companies .
due to the strike , the bosniak-croat car is missing that day as the train pulls out of the station .

in the restaurant car , chef rade reminisces about the past .
" the older passengers remember the days when this train was always packed .
people still had jobs then . "
that was in the 1980s , when yugoslavia was doing well and sarajevo hosted the 1984 olympic winter games .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .
the fdp supports the idea of an all-volunteer , professional army and wants to do away with conscription. gb / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de iran uranium deal prompts cautious optimism hopes are high that the deal brokered by brazil and turkey to turn iran 's controversial enriched uranium supplies into fuel rods outside the islamic republic will be a major step towards solving the on-going stand-off .
-lrb- 17.05.2010 -rrb- future of non-proliferation efforts at stake at treaty review conference representatives from the 189 signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- began a month-long review conference on monday at the united nations headquarters in new york .
-lrb- 03.05.2010 -rrb- iran holds own nuclear conference as new un sanctions loom this weekend iran holds a conference aimed at showing its commitment to a peaceful nuclear program .
but western powers have held talks on further sanctions as china softens its resistance to new measures .
-lrb- 16.04.2010 -rrb- iran 's nuclear work brings fear of mideast arms race as iran continues to develop its nuclear program , analysts fear that an arms race in the middle east could begin .
if sanctions continue to fail , these analysts say that military action is necessary to prevent this .

on sunday , a temporary fix was found for the problem . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions i was wondering why do n't they crimp the leaking tube ?
this could be accomplished with a metal scissor using two oil compression pistons on each side .
or another possibility is to put an expansion cylinder in the leaking tube and activate the pressure when the cylinder is inside the leaking tube .
or another suggestion is to make the leaking tube so cold from the outside using , for example liquid nitrogen or helium , and this would slowly freeze the inner walls of the leaking tube until the tube would be completely frozen and then weld some round metal around the borders at the end of the leaking tube . - andrea , czech republic fabricate and deploy a welded , steel rod-reinforced concrete inverted funnel .
it should have a slotted bottom opening for straddling the existing leaking well pipe .
connect it vertically with siphon tubing from a collection oil tanker . - deane , us if you where to make a 1,000 pound arrow -lrb- as in bow and arrow -rrb- and put a high density steel umbrella device on the end and then stuff it into the pipe , the oil pressure pushing back on the arrow would cause the umbrella device to wedge itself into the pipe .
also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.05.2010 italian art group campaigns to recover long-lost caravaggio painting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real version of caravaggio 's " the nativity " may be with the mafia some 50,000 art thefts are reported each year and nearly all involve organized criminals .
the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

central europe has remained unaffected for the time being . a fresh ash cloud from the icelandic volcano , eyjafjallajokull , which forced the closure of airports overnight across britain , ireland , and the netherlands , has moved on , allowing passenger and cargo flights to resume .
london 's heathrow airport , europe 's busiest , had closed at midnight gmt on sunday but re-opened hours later under restrictions from the uk 's national air traffic service -lrb- nats -rrb- .
dutch authorities said amsterdam 's schiphol airport , europe 's third largest cargo hub and fifth biggest passenger terminus , re-opened ahead of schedule at noon local time on monday .
other airports affected by the flight ban included rotterdam in the netherlands ; dublin , sligo and donegal in ireland ; and manchester and liverpool in england . of those , only rotterdam has re-opened .
germany was unaffected by the ash cloud , with authorities saying early on monday that pollution in german airspace was " weak . "
results of german test flights a series of tests carried out by germany 's flagship carrier lufthansa ended on sunday after a six-hour flight designed to measure volcanic ash concentrations in european airspace .
the tests were conducted with a specially modified airbus a340-600 .
the plane flew with a battery of climate research instruments , which collected data from sensors mounted on the plane 's fuselage .
results are not expected until later on monday , at the earliest . the fresh meteorological data is to be used to help determine the risk for airplanes , should ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano return to central europe .
initial results from german aviation officials suggest german airspace will be spared from the ash cloud in the coming week . bildunterschrift : so far , german airspace remains open airspace closures controversial lufthansa conducted a similar flight on april 20 in the middle of a chaotic week for european air travel .
the initial ash cloud grounded tens of thousands of flights across the continent for nearly a week , leading to the largest airspace shutdown since world war ii .
the closure of airspace was widely criticized by airlines who said that not enough data had been collected to justify an outright closure .
british airways chief willie walsh condemned sunday 's airspace closures as a " gross overreaction to a very minor risk . "
walsh called for a better approach to dealing with the ash problem .
the travel disruptions cost the airlines millions in lost revenues each day .
with the planes grounded , airports likewise suffered financially and tourists and passengers remained stranded for days .
italy 's civil aviation agency has fined irish airline ryanair 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- for failing to aid passengers stranded during the travel disruptions .
the agency said ryanair did n't give 178 passengers mandatory assistance such as food , drink and lodgings while stranded in rome from april 15 to 22. acb / svs / gb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions i was wondering why do n't they crimp the leaking tube ?
this could be accomplished with a metal scissor using two oil compression pistons on each side .
or another possibility is to put an expansion cylinder in the leaking tube and activate the pressure when the cylinder is inside the leaking tube .
or another suggestion is to make the leaking tube so cold from the outside using , for example liquid nitrogen or helium , and this would slowly freeze the inner walls of the leaking tube until the tube would be completely frozen and then weld some round metal around the borders at the end of the leaking tube . - andrea , czech republic fabricate and deploy a welded , steel rod-reinforced concrete inverted funnel .
it should have a slotted bottom opening for straddling the existing leaking well pipe .
connect it vertically with siphon tubing from a collection oil tanker . - deane , us if you where to make a 1,000 pound arrow -lrb- as in bow and arrow -rrb- and put a high density steel umbrella device on the end and then stuff it into the pipe , the oil pressure pushing back on the arrow would cause the umbrella device to wedge itself into the pipe .
also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .

the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .

it is a disgrace for the whole family .

copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .

people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

as a result of the economic crisis , the government has no money to pay their salaries , but the railway company in the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina is investing millions of euros in new high-speed trains to help shorten the 450-kilometer -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- trip from sarajevo via croatia to belgrade to four hours , dzumhur says .
" we want to reunite families who were scattered by the war and facilitate ties between businessmen in bosnia and herzegovina , croatia and serbia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarajevo - the starting point for a long journey the trains run from the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina through the bosnian-serb entity , into eastern croatia and finally to the serbian capital , belgrade .
engines and crew change at every border , including the frontier between the two parts of bosnia .
the trip takes eight hours and 45 minutes and costs under 17 euros -lrb- $ 21,60 -rrb- one way .
" from an economic point of view , this train does n't make any sense , " says conductor hajrudin .
" it is not profitable . " there are n't enough passengers to cover the cost of the trip from sarajevo to belgrade , the war veteran adds .
" this train is more about politics and makes sense as an effort to build bridges between people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train restaurant chef rade faces an empty dining room hajrudin has never made the journey all the way from sarajevo to belgrade .
he leaves the train in doboj , where bosnian-serb colleagues take over , and a new engine is hitched to the cars .
the train usually has three cars , one each from the bosniak-croat , the bosnian-serb and serb train companies .
due to the strike , the bosniak-croat car is missing that day as the train pulls out of the station .
memories of the olympic express only about a dozen passengers are on board a train that can carry at least 150 people .
in the restaurant car , chef rade reminisces about the past .
" the older passengers remember the days when this train was always packed .
people still had jobs then . "
that was in the 1980s , when yugoslavia was doing well and sarajevo hosted the 1984 olympic winter games .
the elegant " olympic express " took businessmen and tourists to belgrade and back .
fifteen years after the end of the war in bosnia , almost no one takes the train from sarajevo all the way to belgrade any more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine hours later - belgrade belgrade peace activist nenad vukosavljevic remains unconvinced by the symbolism of a train that joins the two capitals . " it is sad that the train takes so long for the journey and has to change engines so many times , " vukosavljevic says .
" that really is an admission of failure .
i would n't want to use that as a measuring stick for the state of relations between our countries . "

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "

as a result of the economic crisis , the government has no money to pay their salaries , but the railway company in the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina is investing millions of euros in new high-speed trains to help shorten the 450-kilometer -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- trip from sarajevo via croatia to belgrade to four hours , dzumhur says .
" we want to reunite families who were scattered by the war and facilitate ties between businessmen in bosnia and herzegovina , croatia and serbia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarajevo - the starting point for a long journey the trains run from the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina through the bosnian-serb entity , into eastern croatia and finally to the serbian capital , belgrade .
engines and crew change at every border , including the frontier between the two parts of bosnia .
the trip takes eight hours and 45 minutes and costs under 17 euros -lrb- $ 21,60 -rrb- one way .
" from an economic point of view , this train does n't make any sense , " says conductor hajrudin .
" it is not profitable . " there are n't enough passengers to cover the cost of the trip from sarajevo to belgrade , the war veteran adds .
" this train is more about politics and makes sense as an effort to build bridges between people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train restaurant chef rade faces an empty dining room hajrudin has never made the journey all the way from sarajevo to belgrade .
he leaves the train in doboj , where bosnian-serb colleagues take over , and a new engine is hitched to the cars .
the train usually has three cars , one each from the bosniak-croat , the bosnian-serb and serb train companies .
due to the strike , the bosniak-croat car is missing that day as the train pulls out of the station .
memories of the olympic express only about a dozen passengers are on board a train that can carry at least 150 people .
in the restaurant car , chef rade reminisces about the past .
" the older passengers remember the days when this train was always packed .
people still had jobs then . "
that was in the 1980s , when yugoslavia was doing well and sarajevo hosted the 1984 olympic winter games .
the elegant " olympic express " took businessmen and tourists to belgrade and back .
fifteen years after the end of the war in bosnia , almost no one takes the train from sarajevo all the way to belgrade any more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine hours later - belgrade belgrade peace activist nenad vukosavljevic remains unconvinced by the symbolism of a train that joins the two capitals . " it is sad that the train takes so long for the journey and has to change engines so many times , " vukosavljevic says .
" that really is an admission of failure .
i would n't want to use that as a measuring stick for the state of relations between our countries . "

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "

they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .
etfs are also a good way to invest in commodities , like gold .
" without an etf , i only have the option of buying gold coins , stash them away and hope no one burgles me - or i need a safe , " says cabras .

its xetra trading platform has a market share of 41 percent .
while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade in etfs in germany is worth 13 billion euros per day fund manager fatigue the popularity of etfs can in part be explained by investors ' disappointment in actively-managed funds , which often struggle to outperform a benchmark index .
according to a recent study by gecam , an independent financial services provider that analyzed thousands of funds all over europe , three in four managed funds mirrored indices by up to 90 percent over the last three years .
critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .
etfs often perform just as well as managed funds and charge much lower fees , typically around 0.2-0.4 percent compared with 5 or 6 percent for classic funds .
increasingly complex funds around 90 percent of etfs traded on the german stock exchange are those replicating an index one to one by buying a basket of the underlying shares in that index .
but with the segment experiencing a boom , providers are now offering more sophisticated - or , some would say , riskier - products .
" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .
that means the shares in the dax are n't actually being bought for the etf - the money is invested elsewhere through those swaps .
that 's not good for private investors , " cabras from dsw advises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etfs are considered a safe and simple investment vehicle others point out that those tools are well-established in the financial markets and backed by ample liquidity .

" we can not allow a new financial crisis and that 's why i would say i have no fear of etf structures based on swaps .
deutsche boerse advises investors to be aware of the strategies available , but kraus points out that the main growth in the etf markets will continue to come from classic etfs .

they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .

while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .

critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .
etfs often perform just as well as managed funds and charge much lower fees , typically around 0.2-0.4 percent compared with 5 or 6 percent for classic funds .
increasingly complex funds around 90 percent of etfs traded on the german stock exchange are those replicating an index one to one by buying a basket of the underlying shares in that index .

" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .

since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade in etfs in germany is worth 13 billion euros per day fund manager fatigue the popularity of etfs can in part be explained by investors ' disappointment in actively-managed funds , which often struggle to outperform a benchmark index .
according to a recent study by gecam , an independent financial services provider that analyzed thousands of funds all over europe , three in four managed funds mirrored indices by up to 90 percent over the last three years .
critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .
etfs often perform just as well as managed funds and charge much lower fees , typically around 0.2-0.4 percent compared with 5 or 6 percent for classic funds .
increasingly complex funds around 90 percent of etfs traded on the german stock exchange are those replicating an index one to one by buying a basket of the underlying shares in that index .
but with the segment experiencing a boom , providers are now offering more sophisticated - or , some would say , riskier - products .
" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .
that means the shares in the dax are n't actually being bought for the etf - the money is invested elsewhere through those swaps .
that 's not good for private investors , " cabras from dsw advises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etfs are considered a safe and simple investment vehicle others point out that those tools are well-established in the financial markets and backed by ample liquidity .

instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .
etfs are also a good way to invest in commodities , like gold .
" without an etf , i only have the option of buying gold coins , stash them away and hope no one burgles me - or i need a safe , " says cabras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors can use etfs to buy gold without physical ownership germany is europe 's etf trading hub deutsche boerse , the german stock exchange in frankfurt , is the main trading hub for etfs in europe .
its xetra trading platform has a market share of 41 percent .
while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade in etfs in germany is worth 13 billion euros per day fund manager fatigue the popularity of etfs can in part be explained by investors ' disappointment in actively-managed funds , which often struggle to outperform a benchmark index .
according to a recent study by gecam , an independent financial services provider that analyzed thousands of funds all over europe , three in four managed funds mirrored indices by up to 90 percent over the last three years .
critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .
etfs often perform just as well as managed funds and charge much lower fees , typically around 0.2-0.4 percent compared with 5 or 6 percent for classic funds .
increasingly complex funds around 90 percent of etfs traded on the german stock exchange are those replicating an index one to one by buying a basket of the underlying shares in that index .
but with the segment experiencing a boom , providers are now offering more sophisticated - or , some would say , riskier - products .
" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .
that means the shares in the dax are n't actually being bought for the etf - the money is invested elsewhere through those swaps .
that 's not good for private investors , " cabras from dsw advises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etfs are considered a safe and simple investment vehicle others point out that those tools are well-established in the financial markets and backed by ample liquidity .
" we 've seen definitely that monetary policy worldwide is pumping billions and billions of euros and dollars into the markets and thereby saving the whole financial markets , " halver says .
" we can not allow a new financial crisis and that 's why i would say i have no fear of etf structures based on swaps .
deutsche boerse advises investors to be aware of the strategies available , but kraus points out that the main growth in the etf markets will continue to come from classic etfs .
" investors will use those major , established plain vanilla etfs in order to get exposure to markets in a cost-effective way , " he told deutsche welle .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "

the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .
should the us reject the turkey-brazil deal , it will be seen as taking an unreasonably hard line .
should it accept the deal , its position in the power play over iran 's nuclear ambitions could be affected . rouzbeh parsi believes that hawkish factions in the us congress will not be pleased with the latest developments , believing that the deal could delay stronger action against iran , something some factions in washington are eager to avoid .
parsi said that these factions are afraid that any new un resolution based on the deal will be too weak and that they would prefer to ignore the un and adopt their own . however , meir javedanfar believes that , after the details of the deal are revealed , us president barack obama will offer a positive acceptance of the arrangement - despite the growing internal struggle over iran policy in the us . " obama would have liked to have taken the credit and the glory for this but i think that he 'll just be happy and relieved if this deal goes through , " he said .
" iran has been a major headache for him and the us at a time when he has a lot of other problems to take care of so if brazil and turkey succeed where he has failed - and the level of enrichment the us demanded is met - then i think he will be pleased .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 17.05.2010 italian art group campaigns to recover long-lost caravaggio painting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real version of caravaggio 's " the nativity " may be with the mafia some 50,000 art thefts are reported each year and nearly all involve organized criminals .
the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

i think the government should accept that if they are not bloody minded .
negotiations are the only way out . "
kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .
they say the troubles remain an internal affair .
thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .
diplomatic sources say the thai army is preparing operations to be launched tuesday to retake the rajprasong area unless overnight talks succeed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 17.05.2010 reconciliation train brings bosnians and serbs together - theoretically großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : railway managers hope trains will boost ties trains between sarajevo in bosnia and herzegovina and belgrade in serbia have been running again these past six months - one of the most visible efforts at reconciliation after the bosnian war that ended 15 years ago . with a cigarette and a cup of coffee in hand , narcis dzumhur , chief executive of the bosnian railway in sarajevo , announces the cancellation of the train to belgrade on the following day . dzumhur explains that the employees will be on strike , which is no surprise since they have n't been paid .
as a result of the economic crisis , the government has no money to pay their salaries , but the railway company in the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina is investing millions of euros in new high-speed trains to help shorten the 450-kilometer -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- trip from sarajevo via croatia to belgrade to four hours , dzumhur says .
" we want to reunite families who were scattered by the war and facilitate ties between businessmen in bosnia and herzegovina , croatia and serbia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarajevo - the starting point for a long journey the trains run from the bosniak-croat part of bosnia and herzegovina through the bosnian-serb entity , into eastern croatia and finally to the serbian capital , belgrade .
engines and crew change at every border , including the frontier between the two parts of bosnia .
the trip takes eight hours and 45 minutes and costs under 17 euros -lrb- $ 21,60 -rrb- one way .
" from an economic point of view , this train does n't make any sense , " says conductor hajrudin .
" it is not profitable . " there are n't enough passengers to cover the cost of the trip from sarajevo to belgrade , the war veteran adds .
" this train is more about politics and makes sense as an effort to build bridges between people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train restaurant chef rade faces an empty dining room hajrudin has never made the journey all the way from sarajevo to belgrade .
he leaves the train in doboj , where bosnian-serb colleagues take over , and a new engine is hitched to the cars .
the train usually has three cars , one each from the bosniak-croat , the bosnian-serb and serb train companies .
due to the strike , the bosniak-croat car is missing that day as the train pulls out of the station .
memories of the olympic express only about a dozen passengers are on board a train that can carry at least 150 people .
in the restaurant car , chef rade reminisces about the past .
" the older passengers remember the days when this train was always packed .
people still had jobs then . "
that was in the 1980s , when yugoslavia was doing well and sarajevo hosted the 1984 olympic winter games .
the elegant " olympic express " took businessmen and tourists to belgrade and back .
fifteen years after the end of the war in bosnia , almost no one takes the train from sarajevo all the way to belgrade any more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine hours later - belgrade belgrade peace activist nenad vukosavljevic remains unconvinced by the symbolism of a train that joins the two capitals . " it is sad that the train takes so long for the journey and has to change engines so many times , " vukosavljevic says .
" that really is an admission of failure .
i would n't want to use that as a measuring stick for the state of relations between our countries . "

this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .
some of the culprits showed signs of behavioral disorders , but they were not noticed in time or they did n't receive the help or support they needed . "
bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "

but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .

jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medical workers take an injured child to hospital in hanzhong city after an attack on the same day of his execution , a similar attack was carried out in a kindergarten in southern china , injuring 16 .
one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .
some of the culprits showed signs of behavioral disorders , but they were not noticed in time or they did n't receive the help or support they needed . "
bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman guards at a kindergarten in order to protect children in qingdao city jie song says auto-aggression is much more common among patients than aggression towards others , especially towards children .
but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.05.2010 germany is first in europe for user-friendly exchange-traded funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etfs have been a hit for 10 years at the german stock exchange exchange-traded funds allow investors to spread risk across a stock index instead of relying on fund managers to pick winners .
they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .
etfs are also a good way to invest in commodities , like gold .
" without an etf , i only have the option of buying gold coins , stash them away and hope no one burgles me - or i need a safe , " says cabras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors can use etfs to buy gold without physical ownership germany is europe 's etf trading hub deutsche boerse , the german stock exchange in frankfurt , is the main trading hub for etfs in europe .
its xetra trading platform has a market share of 41 percent .
while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade in etfs in germany is worth 13 billion euros per day fund manager fatigue the popularity of etfs can in part be explained by investors ' disappointment in actively-managed funds , which often struggle to outperform a benchmark index .
according to a recent study by gecam , an independent financial services provider that analyzed thousands of funds all over europe , three in four managed funds mirrored indices by up to 90 percent over the last three years .
critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .
etfs often perform just as well as managed funds and charge much lower fees , typically around 0.2-0.4 percent compared with 5 or 6 percent for classic funds .
increasingly complex funds around 90 percent of etfs traded on the german stock exchange are those replicating an index one to one by buying a basket of the underlying shares in that index .
but with the segment experiencing a boom , providers are now offering more sophisticated - or , some would say , riskier - products .
" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .
that means the shares in the dax are n't actually being bought for the etf - the money is invested elsewhere through those swaps .
that 's not good for private investors , " cabras from dsw advises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etfs are considered a safe and simple investment vehicle others point out that those tools are well-established in the financial markets and backed by ample liquidity .
" we 've seen definitely that monetary policy worldwide is pumping billions and billions of euros and dollars into the markets and thereby saving the whole financial markets , " halver says .
" we can not allow a new financial crisis and that 's why i would say i have no fear of etf structures based on swaps .
deutsche boerse advises investors to be aware of the strategies available , but kraus points out that the main growth in the etf markets will continue to come from classic etfs .
" investors will use those major , established plain vanilla etfs in order to get exposure to markets in a cost-effective way , " he told deutsche welle .

they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .
etfs are also a good way to invest in commodities , like gold .
" without an etf , i only have the option of buying gold coins , stash them away and hope no one burgles me - or i need a safe , " says cabras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors can use etfs to buy gold without physical ownership germany is europe 's etf trading hub deutsche boerse , the german stock exchange in frankfurt , is the main trading hub for etfs in europe .
its xetra trading platform has a market share of 41 percent .
while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade in etfs in germany is worth 13 billion euros per day fund manager fatigue the popularity of etfs can in part be explained by investors ' disappointment in actively-managed funds , which often struggle to outperform a benchmark index .
according to a recent study by gecam , an independent financial services provider that analyzed thousands of funds all over europe , three in four managed funds mirrored indices by up to 90 percent over the last three years .
critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .
etfs often perform just as well as managed funds and charge much lower fees , typically around 0.2-0.4 percent compared with 5 or 6 percent for classic funds .
increasingly complex funds around 90 percent of etfs traded on the german stock exchange are those replicating an index one to one by buying a basket of the underlying shares in that index .
but with the segment experiencing a boom , providers are now offering more sophisticated - or , some would say , riskier - products .
" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .
that means the shares in the dax are n't actually being bought for the etf - the money is invested elsewhere through those swaps .
that 's not good for private investors , " cabras from dsw advises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etfs are considered a safe and simple investment vehicle others point out that those tools are well-established in the financial markets and backed by ample liquidity .

" we can not allow a new financial crisis and that 's why i would say i have no fear of etf structures based on swaps .
deutsche boerse advises investors to be aware of the strategies available , but kraus points out that the main growth in the etf markets will continue to come from classic etfs .
" investors will use those major , established plain vanilla etfs in order to get exposure to markets in a cost-effective way , " he told deutsche welle .

but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks also look at how to include muslim religious instruction in schools the interior ministry has said that the conference would focus on gender equality , preventing the rise of extremism , and the introduction of islamic religion classes in schools .
german students in public schools can choose to take courses in roman catholic , protestant , jewish or , as part of an ongoing pilot program , muslim studies .
in march , interior minister thomas de maiziere said he would exclude another organization , the islam council , from the talks .
leaders of one of the dominant groups in that council , milli gorus , are under investigation for tax fraud and misuse of funds , and it has been accused of supporting a fundamentalist brand of islam .
a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.05.2010 second german islam conference begins amid criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between 3.8 million and 4.2 million muslims live in germany the second german islam conference brings together 34 individuals and groups representing both government bodies and muslims .
but the absence of two groups at the discussion table has led to criticism . a government-sponsored conference on islam in germany started on monday , but it convened without two major organizations that represent the country 's muslims .
the conference brings together politicians and representatives of the muslim community to discuss integration . there are an estimated 3.8 million to 4.2 million muslims living in germany , the majority of whom have turkish roots .
about half of them are german citizens .
the conference includes 17 state representatives and 17 individuals and groups from the muslim community .
but only two of the country 's four largest muslim umbrella groups were to be at the table - the turkish islamic union , ditib , and the union of islamic cultural centers .
inclusion and exclusion the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , which represents an alliance of sunni mosques throughout germany , said on last week that it would boycott the meeting .
axel ayyub koehler , the organization 's leader , said that the conference " is not sufficient to solve the urgent social problems and concerns that have arisen between muslims , politicians , and the population . "
koehler said the conference needs to include discussions about " islamophobia " and discrimination against muslims on its agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks also look at how to include muslim religious instruction in schools the interior ministry has said that the conference would focus on gender equality , preventing the rise of extremism , and the introduction of islamic religion classes in schools .
german students in public schools can choose to take courses in roman catholic , protestant , jewish or , as part of an ongoing pilot program , muslim studies .
in march , interior minister thomas de maiziere said he would exclude another organization , the islam council , from the talks .
leaders of one of the dominant groups in that council , milli gorus , are under investigation for tax fraud and misuse of funds , and it has been accused of supporting a fundamentalist brand of islam .
a ' mere tea party ? '
the conference was founded in 2006 by then-interior minister wolfgang schaeuble as a way to promote dialogue about integration .
but its critics say it has failed to produce any concrete policy changes or clear directions for muslims to follow regarding integration .
green party co-chairman cem oezdemir told germany 's epd news agency on sunday that the body risked becoming a " mere tea party . "
he stressed that it should be aiming for full participation of muslims in society , with all the rights and obligations that others have .

earlier , the foreign ministers of iran , turkey and brazil unveiled the agreement to ship iranian low-enriched uranium to turkey . the agreement would see iran ship 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to turkey , which it would exchange it for fuel to power a medical research reactor in tehran .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said it was time for the so-called five-plus-one countries - the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany - to enter negotiations " based on honesty , justice and mutual respect . "
deputy spokesman for the german government christoph steegmans was cautious when assessing whether the deal would prevent new un sanctions .
" it of course remains important that iran and the iaea reach an accord , " he told reporters in berlin .
" that can not be replaced by an accord with other countries . "
the office of european union 's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , catherine ashton , expressed similar caution , saying the eu would welcome the deal if it delivers on its promises .
" this is a move in the right direction , but it does not answer all of the concerns raised over iran 's nuclear program , " a spokesman for ashton told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the three foreign ministers signed the deal on monday push for sanctions turkey and brazil , both non-permanent members of the security council , had offered to mediate talks on a uranium swap as a last-chance effort to avoid fresh sanctions being imposed on iran .
the islamic republic had failed to accept a deal proposed by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that would ship low-enriched uranium to russia , then later to france for further enrichment .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters on monday that the signed agreement " shows that tehran wants to open a constructive path , " and that there was " no more grounds for new sanctions and pressures . "
western nations have long feared iran 's nuclear program is a cover to build a nuclear bomb , despite tehran 's insistence that it is strictly meant for peaceful purposes. acb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the arrangement with turkey is expected to deprive iran of its stockpile of enriched uranium which would now be shipped abroad for further processing , returning in a lower-level , safer form which could not be adapted for use in nuclear weapons .
the rods would then be used in the tehran research reactor -lrb- trr -rrb- .
the deal appears to revive a stalled nuclear fuel-swap deal backed by the united nations in october last year .
iran 's enrichment of uranium has been at the heart of international concern over tehran 's nuclear activities with western powers convinced that the iranians were pursuing an atomic weapons program .
previous efforts by the five permanent un security council members - the us , britain , france , russia and china - and germany have focused on stopping iran 's enrichment activities .
abandoned talks , belligerent rhetoric and sabre rattling on both sides appeared to have driven iran and its western rivals further towards a dead end in negotiations , with the threat of new sanctions and the last-resort of military action bandied about as possible next steps in the west 's attempts to deny iran its nuclear technology .
experts see deal as a step toward a breakthrough bildunterschrift : the iranian , brazilian and turkish delegations hailed the deal while the west remained tight-lipped while it is currently unclear how much uranium will eventually be shipped to turkey , whether turkey will actually be doing the enrichment itself and when the swap will begin , it is hoped that iran 's acceptance of the deal will be enough to at least provide the west with a period of reflection .
" we do n't know as yet how this deal will pan out and there are still some questions over who will be doing the enrichment , " meir javedanfar , a middle east analyst and the director for the middle east economic and political analysis -lrb- meepas -rrb- think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" france was the original country suggested in the previous un proposal but iran rejected that .
but if the deal goes through and the level of 75 percent on iran 's enriched uranium is sent abroad in one batch - as stipulated by the obama administration -then we can cautiously begin looking at this as a breakthrough . "
" this is of course very beneficial for the iranians as it will take some of the edge off the talk of further sanctions , " rouzbeh parsi , an iran expert at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it will also give russia and china the opportunity to strengthen their positions against sanctions so that will also be good for iran .
but it 's not as good as it could be .
iran has been enriching since rejecting the initial un proposal in october and so they have a lot more uranium than before .
this means the levels of the deal could be met but the iranians could still have a lot more at home , which will continue to cause friction . "
details of agreement to be presented to iaea iran will be hoping that the iaea 's acceptance of the deal will ease the pressure building on tehran over its nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi hopes for iaea approval iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast revealed that the iaea will be informed of the details of the deal in a letter within the week before a final agreement is signed between iran , its main negotiating partners and the iaea . a month after the agreement is signed , the uranium - currently enriched to a level of 3.5 percent - would be shipped to turkey , where it would be stored under iaea and iranian supervision , mehmanparast said .
the fuel rods would contain material processed to just under 20 percent .
enrichment of 90 percent is needed to produce material for nuclear warheads . however , rouzbeh parsi believes that the iaea will not be rushing to embrace the deal as a breakthrough just yet . " iaea director general yukiya amano is more in line with the western thinking about iran 's nuclear ambitions and so will be more skeptical of this deal until there are more details , " he said .
" so far , there has been nothing said about whether iran will agree to cease all enrichment while the uranium is out of the country , a demand of the security council .
so this deal looks to fall short of the council 's resolution which could mean louder calls for sanctions . " united states skeptical over developments the united states has acknowledged that the agreement represents a positive development , however skepticism and the threat of sanctions remain .
" it does not change the steps that we are taking to hold iran responsible for its obligations , including sanctions , " said white house spokesman robert gibbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama should be pleased with any breakthrough on iran notwithstanding the muted reaction , the agreement , which could pave the way to a resolution of the drawn out stand-off , puts the us in a difficult position .

on sunday , a temporary fix was found for the problem . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions i was wondering why do n't they crimp the leaking tube ?
this could be accomplished with a metal scissor using two oil compression pistons on each side .
or another possibility is to put an expansion cylinder in the leaking tube and activate the pressure when the cylinder is inside the leaking tube .
or another suggestion is to make the leaking tube so cold from the outside using , for example liquid nitrogen or helium , and this would slowly freeze the inner walls of the leaking tube until the tube would be completely frozen and then weld some round metal around the borders at the end of the leaking tube . - andrea , czech republic fabricate and deploy a welded , steel rod-reinforced concrete inverted funnel .
it should have a slotted bottom opening for straddling the existing leaking well pipe .
connect it vertically with siphon tubing from a collection oil tanker . - deane , us if you where to make a 1,000 pound arrow -lrb- as in bow and arrow -rrb- and put a high density steel umbrella device on the end and then stuff it into the pipe , the oil pressure pushing back on the arrow would cause the umbrella device to wedge itself into the pipe .
also look into patents on using plastic foam-filled jersey barriers cabled together as an oil boom .
i believe they would extend high enough above the water to be more effective in high seas than what they are using .
one last thing , the fishermen can install a small v-shaped boom on the bow of their boats , collect the oil and sell it back to the refinery . - glenn , us there are two solutions to the oil leaking out .
either you stop the leak or divert it .
there are tubes made of some kind of nylon that are used for throwing down refuse from high rises under construction .
could n't you weigh down the bottom and place such a tube over the leak ?
the oil would then be diverted up through the tube to a place where it could be collected .
just a thought . - helen , canada use a farm harvesting combine , like they use for harvesting wheat and alfalfa .
put it on pontoons and have some kind of a vacuum or suction system attached .
as it cuts through the oil and water the rotating blades continually pull up the oil as it is sucked into a container . - victor , us what if we drilled next to the pipe that is leaking not to redirect the oil but to plant explosives ?
if we dug deep enough it seems to me we could collapse the pipe and the earth around it with explosives .
if we went deep enough would not the earth itself seal the leak ? - michael , us since normal methods have failed , explosive experts should set up a series of shaped charges , place them in a ring on the sea floor around the well and set them off .
they need to be designed to create a wedge of dirt and a shock wave to focus the wedge down and into the center so that a huge mass of sea floor dirt crushes the oil well casing and blocks off further leakage .
this will probably not completely block it off but should slow it down by at least an order of magnitude . - john , us is setting the spill on fire an option ? - judi , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .
the fdp supports the idea of an all-volunteer , professional army and wants to do away with conscription. gb / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

markus babbel has been charged with getting the team back up .
but he 'll also have to mind the balance sheet , meaning some hard choices . as the trauma that was hertha berlin in 2009-10 wound down , the team garnered some unusual praise .
leverkusen coach jupp heynckes said they were the best team ever to be relegated , while bayern coach louis van gaal , whose side handed hertha their final defeat off the season , said that two of hertha 's players were good enough to play for the mighty bavarians .
van gaal neglected to say which ones , but his remark highlights the dilemma berlin 's management now faces .
already in debt to the tune of 33 million euros , -lrb- $ 42.2 million -rrb- hertha reportedly need to reduce their personnel costs from 30 to 13 million euros .
that means selling off players , but the club has to try to retain enough talent to have a chance of returning to the top flight and the big bucks that division one brings .
on monday , markus babbel - an ex-bayern star and former stuttgart coach - was given a one-year contract .
the message is clear : hertha are gunning for immediate promotion .
but where will he and hertha be forced to cash in ?
and what players will be on other clubs ' shopping lists ?
here 's a back-to-front list .
the back five bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been a rock for hertha for two seasons it 's an open secret that captain and german national defender arne friedrich will be moving elsewhere , with friedrich himself saying at the weekend that he 'd played his last match for berlin .
wolfsburg , which is headed by former hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness , is thought to be prepared to offer two million euros for arne friedrich .
hertha would welcome and instantly accept such an offer since when friedrich 's salary is taken into account , they would save five million euros .
another less welcome loss is almost certainly going to be goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
hertha tried unsuccessfully to get the czech to extend his expiring contract , and he can leave free of charge .
surprisingly , no one has yet grabbed drobny , who was among the top in his position for the past two seasons .
still there 's little chance that a keeper with aspirations of becoming the czech republic 's no. 1 is going to go down to the second division .
hertha will save his salary and try to find a cheaper replacement .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kacar is berlin 's most valuable asset one of two jewels in hertha 's midfield is gojko kacar .
the 23-year-old serbian enjoyed a fine season in 2008-9 and is rated at around 8.5 million euros .
a host of big european clubs including manchester united have reportedly had an eye on him in the past .
the dilemma for hertha is that kacar 's salary is relatively low and if he could be persuaded to give his all in the second division , he 's the sort of player who could help berlin get promoted .
on the other had , he had knee trouble this year so hertha might be wise to get big money for him straight away .
another hertha midfielder who could be of use to other teams is raffael .
the brazilian is a technically gifted playmaker who scored seven goals this season and is valued at 5.5 million .
berlin will no doubt try to keep raffael , their offensive leader , but he too brings with him a dilemma .
the main reason his value is n't higher is the sense that , for all his skill , he 's too small for the absolute top level .
that 's a weakness that could make him less effective in division two , where the play is more physical and the refereeing generally more lenient than in the german top flight .
neither kacar nor raffael has given an indication one way or the other of whether they 'd be willing to stay in berlin in division two and accept the salary cut that would entail .
hertha is likely to sell one in a bid to keep the other , but if the money were right , both could be sent packing to a generous new home .
the strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos did n't do badly at all for his first season in germany hertha have lots of forwards they would like to sell , but only one anyone is likely to want to buy : adrian ramos .
the colombian scored 10 goals this past season , despite only joining hertha late last summer and getting very little service worth the name .
that would suggest his estimated transfer worth of 3.5 million is an under-valuation .
arguing against a sale , from hertha 's perspective , is the fact they only own 80 percent of his transfer rights and will need a big , strong forward for the coming campaign in division two .
but rumors have swirled that ramos wants no part of life in lower-division german football , which could force hertha 's hand .
so no one will be surprised if ramos , or any of the other few stand-outs from hertha 's disastrous season , sign on with new employers in the coming weeks .
and that would make new coach markus babbel 's task all the tougher .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .
the fdp supports the idea of an all-volunteer , professional army and wants to do away with conscription. gb / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

the majority of works are never found , but an italian organization has sent out a plea for a painting stolen over 40 years ago . ludovico gippetto gazes at a masterpiece by the renaissance painter caravaggio .
he points to the figures in the 1609 painting that are bathed in the artist 's signature light and shadows . " it 's the manger scene during the holy night , " he said .
" the mother mary has just given birth and placed the baby on the ground in the stall . " the painting " nativity with st. francis and st. lawrence " is n't in a gilded frame .
it sits in gippetto 's palm .
it 's a postcard just like the ones museum visitors pick up at the gift store - with one glaring exception .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gippetto is dedicated to recovering stolen art - no matter how long it 's been gone emblazoned across the top of this postcard is the word " wanted . " missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

" missing in action the masterpiece has not been seen since october 16 , 1969 , when it disappeared from the altar of a chapel in the sicilian capital palermo .
gippetto is on a mission to get it back . the 44-year-old with shoulder-length hair looks like a renaissance painter but his passion is n't for creating art , rather for recovering stolen pieces so everyone can enjoy them . " a piece of art can not be completely possessed , " gippetto said .
" it 's our cultural heritage . our role is only to take care of it and then pass it on to future generations . " when he was just 23 years old , gippetto founded extroart , a group dedicated to retrieving stolen art that has been hidden in basements or warehouses or even hanging on an unsuspecting person 's wall .
this year 's campaign focuses on the missing caravaggio , long suspected to be in the hands of the mafia . a former mafioso-turned-informant claimed in 1996 that he had stolen the work on the orders of a boss . others say an amateur lifted it and peddled it to the mafia . " the mafiosi who 've turned into informants have done nothing but contradict themselves , " said gippetto .
" i will believe them only when i find a person that has seen the painting and then his statement can be checked . "
theories have circulated that rats and pigs ruined it while it was stored at a farm .
it could even be hidden in another country .
fear of the mafia extroart has distributed postcards of the caravaggio painting throughout italy and worldwide via embassies and cultural institutions .
the hope is that someone somewhere will recognize the piece , which is also listed among the fbi 's top ten missing artworks . " maybe some little old sicilian woman has this painting and does n't even know it , " theorized extroart volunteer antonio rosato .
" she has it in her attic .
the neighborhood boss gave it to her in a sack and said do n't open until i return and he has n't so it 's just sitting there . " in sicily , even an honest person in possession of the painting may worry that revealing its location will incite the wrath of the mafia . " i am convinced that one of the strengths of the organized criminals is their ability to play on the ignorance of many and also exploit their fear , " said rosato .
extroart encourages those who know of the whereabouts of a stolen painting to break the code of silence and call .
no questions will be asked . bildunterschrift : the " wanted " postcards were designed to raise awareness of the missing painting art for drugs and weapons for the art detectives , one thing is nearly certain : mobsters ' fingerprints are on the caravaggio canvas .
organized crime has played a role in nearly every art heist since world war ii .
art theft experts say they have the ideal set-up - a sophisticated network for stealing and smuggling items , forging documents and laundering cash . crime novels and movies fuel the theory that a dashing art thief sells the masterpiece to " a bavarian count with a curly mustache who is in a castle full of stolen art , " art theft expert noah charney said .
put some paint remover on that theory . " most stolen art is stolen either to be ransomed or to be used on a closed black market for trade or collateral between other groups of organized criminals for other illicit goods like drugs and arms , " said charney , the founding director of the association for research into crimes against art . the thieves take in about $ 6 billion a year , according to the u.s. federal bureau of investigation , making art crime the third most profitable criminal enterprise behind drugs and arms trafficking . a needle in a haystack those looking for the stolen art have n't had as much success .
" retrieving stolen art is nearly impossible , " charney said .
" the very best recovery rates for stolen art are about 10 percent .
the more famous the work , the better the chance for recovery . "
caravaggio 's nativity scene has n't surfaced for 40 years and extroart is convinced that the postcard campaign could help uncover its location .
the group has defied the odds in the past . a few years ago , extroart produced postcards for the 18th-century painting " madonna del lume , " which had been stolen from a palermo church . " the very next day , i received an anonymous phone call , " gippetto said . " the work that we 'd featured on the postcards had been delivered to the caretaker 's workshop at the sisters of saint vincent convent in palermo . " extroart is waiting for a call about the caravaggio painting ; phone lines are open and volunteers are ready . antonio rosato said the thieves stole " a piece of our history . " " when we lose reminders of the past , our identity fades away , " he continued .
" with this campaign , we hope that we can return the nativity to its proper home in the chapel . "

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

so what will coach joachim loew do ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase offers his thoughts . no player is irreplaceable , at least as far conventional football wisdom goes .
but michael ballack is about as irreplaceable as any one player could be on the german national team .
it does n't take much inspiration to imagine the four-letter words that escaped coach joachim loew 's lips , when it was announced on monday that ballack had torn ankle ligaments in this weekend 's fa cup final in england and would be sidelined for the world cup .
the 33-year-old ballack has been a mainstay for germany since first being capped in 1999 .
he 's scored 42 goals in 98 appearances for the national team and the most experienced player on a relatively youthful squad .
but his absence also poses a tactical conundrum since it was taken for granted that the captain would pair with bastian schweinsteiger in a dual holding midfielder role .
it is now unclear who will be responsible for breaking up opponents ' attacks and play the all-important opening pass when germany press forward .
limited options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , r , is n't there to back up ballack joachim loew 's penchant for committing early to who is and out of his squad may come back to haunt him .
the german player most comparable to ballack in terms of experience and style is bremen 's torsten frings .
but loew made it clear at the start of the year he had no use for frings .
loew could technically nominate him as a replacement , but given the huge personal acrimony between the two men , it 's hard to see frings on the plane to south africa .
more likely is that sami khedira will be called upon to fill the ballack role .
the midfielder is known for being hard-nosed in defense and won a league title with stuttgart in 2007 .
but he 's only 23 years old and has made a grand total of two appearances for the german national team .
loew could also change his strategy , perhaps relying more on germany 's bevy on up-and-coming offensive midfielders , including mesut oezil , toni kroos , marko marin and thomas mueller .
but all of them are young , and only oezil has made a significant contribution to the national squad in the past .
out-of-form striker mario gomez and naturalized brazilian cacau could also play bigger roles , if loew decides to go with two out-and-out strikers up front .
cruel irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack got hurt playing for his club chelsea barring an unlikely return by frings , loew will probably opt for a mixture of his options .
but if germany are to progress beyond their opening group in south africa , it will be with a different team than the one loew was envisioning before the weekend .
ironically , the foul that led to ballack 's absence was kevin prince-boateng , who was born in germany .
in his younger years , the berlin native was once touted as a potential replacement for the captain in the nationalelf .
boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

boateng ended that possibility after his star fell and he decided to play for ghana 's national team .
now , boateng may have ended any chance germany had to contend for the world cup title .

the decision to deny hogefeld an early release was made after koehler personally heard her plea , his office said .
hogefeld was a third generation member of the leftist raf terrorist group in the 1980s , which was responsible for the assassinations of siemens manager karl-heinz beckurts in 1986 , deutsche bank ceo alfred herrhausen in 1989 and detlev karsten rohwedder , the head of the german agency charged with privatizing east german state businesses after unification , in 1991 .
while serving her sentence , hogefeld , who is now 53 , distanced herself from the actions of the raf , but has never given a detailed account , or divulged her knowledge , of the crimes committed by the group .
during her trial in 1993 , she said she had lured an american soldier out of a disco in 1985 to obtain his military id .
the man was later found shot in the head in a nearby forest .
the id card was then used to get a car packed with explosives onto the us rhine-main airbase in frankfurt in an attack that killed two people and injured 20 others .

hogefeld was a third generation member of the leftist raf terrorist group in the 1980s , which was responsible for the assassinations of siemens manager karl-heinz beckurts in 1986 , deutsche bank ceo alfred herrhausen in 1989 and detlev karsten rohwedder , the head of the german agency charged with privatizing east german state businesses after unification , in 1991 .

but few were seen leaving the camp at rajprasong – an upmarket commercial and retail location in central bangkok that they have occupied since april 3 , paralyzing normal business .
the deadline was then extended before the thai security forces prepared to move into the area .
up to 30,000 troops have been deployed around the city to retake the rajprasong protest site .
renegade general dies from gunshot wound clashes between the protesters and military forces escalated over the weekend with the death toll from three days of military operations rising to 36 , including the death monday of a renegade army major general khattiya sawasdiphol from a gunshot wound he received last week .
the general , also known as seh daeng , sided with the protesters and had overseen security at their camp .

the general , who was shot by an unidentified sniper , died from his wounds on monday since the protests began in mid-march 65 people have died and another 1,600 have been injured .

kudeb saikrajang , a member of the opposition puea thai party that has been supporting the red shirt movement , said , " the red shirt leaders asked for negotiations and they have no conditions .
i think the government should accept that if they are not bloody minded .
negotiations are the only way out . "
kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .
they say the troubles remain an internal affair .
thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .
diplomatic sources say the thai army is preparing operations to be launched tuesday to retake the rajprasong area unless overnight talks succeed .

kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .
they say the troubles remain an internal affair .
thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .
diplomatic sources say the thai army is preparing operations to be launched tuesday to retake the rajprasong area unless overnight talks succeed .

but few were seen leaving the camp at rajprasong – an upmarket commercial and retail location in central bangkok that they have occupied since april 3 , paralyzing normal business .
the deadline was then extended before the thai security forces prepared to move into the area .
up to 30,000 troops have been deployed around the city to retake the rajprasong protest site .
renegade general dies from gunshot wound clashes between the protesters and military forces escalated over the weekend with the death toll from three days of military operations rising to 36 , including the death monday of a renegade army major general khattiya sawasdiphol from a gunshot wound he received last week .
the general , also known as seh daeng , sided with the protesters and had overseen security at their camp .
bildunterschrift : in this photo taken on may 8 , renegade general khattiya sawasdiphol greets anti-government supporters .
the general , who was shot by an unidentified sniper , died from his wounds on monday since the protests began in mid-march 65 people have died and another 1,600 have been injured .
panitan wattanayagorn , a thai government spokesman , expressed concern over the loss of life .
" we are very concerned and the operation will be adjusted as we face strong resistance from several groups of people attacking the checkpoints .
it is very unusual to have groups of people with weapons attacking the checkpoints .
this is not a normal situation . "
government declares holidays around the areas where checkpoints were to be set up , smoke billowed from burning rubber tires on the main roads .
the five star dusit thansi hotel , located near red shirt barricades in the financial district of silom road , was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade late sunday .
due to the violence , the government was forced to declare public holidays on monday and tuesday .
schools were also closed .
bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters still dance to live music though numbers have fallen efforts on for last-minute talks the growing threat of further violence led to efforts late monday for new talks between the red shirt leaders and the government .
kudeb saikrajang , a member of the opposition puea thai party that has been supporting the red shirt movement , said , " the red shirt leaders asked for negotiations and they have no conditions .
i think the government should accept that if they are not bloody minded .
negotiations are the only way out . "
kudeb criticised the red shirt leadership for rejecting a five point peace plan offered by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva earlier this month as a way to end the resistance .
the offer included early elections due in november .
but talks broke down over criminal investigations into the violence .
a call by former prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , a key backer of the red shirt movement , for talks with the united nations as mediator , was rejected by the government .
they say the troubles remain an internal affair .
thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and is living in exile as he faces a jail term for corruption on his return .
diplomatic sources say the thai army is preparing operations to be launched tuesday to retake the rajprasong area unless overnight talks succeed .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medical workers take an injured child to hospital in hanzhong city after an attack on the same day of his execution , a similar attack was carried out in a kindergarten in southern china , injuring 16 .
one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .
some of the culprits showed signs of behavioral disorders , but they were not noticed in time or they did n't receive the help or support they needed . "
bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman guards at a kindergarten in order to protect children in qingdao city jie song says auto-aggression is much more common among patients than aggression towards others , especially towards children .
but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

at least 16 people have been killed and over 70 injured , leaving people wanting to know why . the first attack was carried out on march 23 in fujian province by a doctor who had been unemployed for nearly a year .
when asked why he killed eight children in a kindergarten , he said he carried out the attack , not because he hated children , but because they were weak and vulnerable and killing them would thus get him attention .
after fast track proceedings , zheng mingsheng was put to death a month later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medical workers take an injured child to hospital in hanzhong city after an attack on the same day of his execution , a similar attack was carried out in a kindergarten in southern china , injuring 16 .
one the two following days , there were two similar assaults .
the latest case happened on sunday night , as a 20-year-old man attacked six women with a meat cleaver before killing himself .
this unprecedented wave of violence has left the chinese people searching for answers .
the high price of rapid growth professor of sociology at jiangsu university , he wenjiong , believes while each of these cases needs to be examined individually , it can be said there is one thing the attacks have in common , that is , they show a core problem , the high price of china 's rapid societal change .
" our economy and society are changing so rapidly that society can not keep pace and we do n't have enough regulatory mechanisms .
some of the attacks were carried out because of great social disparities .
in other cases , the attackers felt their interests were not represented .
some of the culprits showed signs of behavioral disorders , but they were not noticed in time or they did n't receive the help or support they needed . "
bildunterschrift : children were targeted because they are " weak and vulnerable " dr. jie song is a chinese psychologist who got her degree in germany .
her place of work , the institute for psychology at the university of freiburg , has a cooperation program to train chinese doctors in psychology .
she says though people have access to mental health care in china , especially in the larger cities it does n't help much because of traditional core values .
she says modern psychology " is new to china .
psychology used to be taboo .
but even today , there are not enough well-trained professionals to take care of these individuals .
when chinese people have symptoms , they prefer going to normal doctors .
there are a lot of people who ca n't accept that they or a family member has a mental problem .
it is a disgrace for the whole family .
you just ca n't afford to be mentally ill . "
copycat killers jie song believes one reason there have been further attacks is because people are mimicking the first assault , which was widely covered inside of china and outside .
" i think these kinds of things also happened in the past but they were n't covered in the news .
the media was never as open as it is now so people did n't know what was going on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman guards at a kindergarten in order to protect children in qingdao city jie song says auto-aggression is much more common among patients than aggression towards others , especially towards children .
but she worries that because the cases draw so much media attention , the culprits here are offered a larger platform for their messages .
people in china are asking how the state can take charge .
some believe media coverage should be banned .
jie song believes fringe groups should be more closely watched by the state .
she also suggests people start speaking more freely about psychological problems so they become de-stigmatized and accepted in society .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .

the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .

leaders of the christian democratic union and fdp parliamentary groups sat down in berlin on monday , not sure of what was going to come out of their meeting .
until now the fdp was not prepared to allow conscientious objectors to voluntarily extend their compulsory civilian service up to six months .
the agreement hammered out by the two sides on monday allows just that .
it also gives those doing community service instead of military service the option of choosing - two months into their stint - whether or not to extend it up to six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian service is essential to keep social services operating compulsory military service , for those men drafted into the german bundeswehr at age 19 , will be cut to six months , with the option of voluntarily extending active duty .
the fdp was unable to convince its political partners to give those opting to do alternative community service a monetary bonus for signing up longer , as active duty soldiers get .
the agreement was nonetheless a success for the fdp because it paves the way for reducing the length of both services this year and strengthens the voluntary aspect of the duty .

markus babbel has been charged with getting the team back up .
but he 'll also have to mind the balance sheet , meaning some hard choices . as the trauma that was hertha berlin in 2009-10 wound down , the team garnered some unusual praise .
leverkusen coach jupp heynckes said they were the best team ever to be relegated , while bayern coach louis van gaal , whose side handed hertha their final defeat off the season , said that two of hertha 's players were good enough to play for the mighty bavarians .
van gaal neglected to say which ones , but his remark highlights the dilemma berlin 's management now faces .
already in debt to the tune of 33 million euros , -lrb- $ 42.2 million -rrb- hertha reportedly need to reduce their personnel costs from 30 to 13 million euros .
that means selling off players , but the club has to try to retain enough talent to have a chance of returning to the top flight and the big bucks that division one brings .
on monday , markus babbel - an ex-bayern star and former stuttgart coach - was given a one-year contract .
the message is clear : hertha are gunning for immediate promotion .
but where will he and hertha be forced to cash in ?
and what players will be on other clubs ' shopping lists ?
here 's a back-to-front list .
the back five bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been a rock for hertha for two seasons it 's an open secret that captain and german national defender arne friedrich will be moving elsewhere , with friedrich himself saying at the weekend that he 'd played his last match for berlin .
wolfsburg , which is headed by former hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness , is thought to be prepared to offer two million euros for arne friedrich .
hertha would welcome and instantly accept such an offer since when friedrich 's salary is taken into account , they would save five million euros .
another less welcome loss is almost certainly going to be goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
hertha tried unsuccessfully to get the czech to extend his expiring contract , and he can leave free of charge .
surprisingly , no one has yet grabbed drobny , who was among the top in his position for the past two seasons .
still there 's little chance that a keeper with aspirations of becoming the czech republic 's no. 1 is going to go down to the second division .
hertha will save his salary and try to find a cheaper replacement .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kacar is berlin 's most valuable asset one of two jewels in hertha 's midfield is gojko kacar .
the 23-year-old serbian enjoyed a fine season in 2008-9 and is rated at around 8.5 million euros .
a host of big european clubs including manchester united have reportedly had an eye on him in the past .
the dilemma for hertha is that kacar 's salary is relatively low and if he could be persuaded to give his all in the second division , he 's the sort of player who could help berlin get promoted .
on the other had , he had knee trouble this year so hertha might be wise to get big money for him straight away .
another hertha midfielder who could be of use to other teams is raffael .
the brazilian is a technically gifted playmaker who scored seven goals this season and is valued at 5.5 million .
berlin will no doubt try to keep raffael , their offensive leader , but he too brings with him a dilemma .
the main reason his value is n't higher is the sense that , for all his skill , he 's too small for the absolute top level .
that 's a weakness that could make him less effective in division two , where the play is more physical and the refereeing generally more lenient than in the german top flight .
neither kacar nor raffael has given an indication one way or the other of whether they 'd be willing to stay in berlin in division two and accept the salary cut that would entail .
hertha is likely to sell one in a bid to keep the other , but if the money were right , both could be sent packing to a generous new home .
the strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos did n't do badly at all for his first season in germany hertha have lots of forwards they would like to sell , but only one anyone is likely to want to buy : adrian ramos .
the colombian scored 10 goals this past season , despite only joining hertha late last summer and getting very little service worth the name .
that would suggest his estimated transfer worth of 3.5 million is an under-valuation .
arguing against a sale , from hertha 's perspective , is the fact they only own 80 percent of his transfer rights and will need a big , strong forward for the coming campaign in division two .
but rumors have swirled that ramos wants no part of life in lower-division german football , which could force hertha 's hand .
so no one will be surprised if ramos , or any of the other few stand-outs from hertha 's disastrous season , sign on with new employers in the coming weeks .
and that would make new coach markus babbel 's task all the tougher .

markus babbel has been charged with getting the team back up .
but he 'll also have to mind the balance sheet , meaning some hard choices . as the trauma that was hertha berlin in 2009-10 wound down , the team garnered some unusual praise .
leverkusen coach jupp heynckes said they were the best team ever to be relegated , while bayern coach louis van gaal , whose side handed hertha their final defeat off the season , said that two of hertha 's players were good enough to play for the mighty bavarians .
van gaal neglected to say which ones , but his remark highlights the dilemma berlin 's management now faces .
already in debt to the tune of 33 million euros , -lrb- $ 42.2 million -rrb- hertha reportedly need to reduce their personnel costs from 30 to 13 million euros .
that means selling off players , but the club has to try to retain enough talent to have a chance of returning to the top flight and the big bucks that division one brings .
on monday , markus babbel - an ex-bayern star and former stuttgart coach - was given a one-year contract .
the message is clear : hertha are gunning for immediate promotion .
but where will he and hertha be forced to cash in ?
and what players will be on other clubs ' shopping lists ?
here 's a back-to-front list .
the back five bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drobny has been a rock for hertha for two seasons it 's an open secret that captain and german national defender arne friedrich will be moving elsewhere , with friedrich himself saying at the weekend that he 'd played his last match for berlin .
wolfsburg , which is headed by former hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness , is thought to be prepared to offer two million euros for arne friedrich .
hertha would welcome and instantly accept such an offer since when friedrich 's salary is taken into account , they would save five million euros .
another less welcome loss is almost certainly going to be goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
hertha tried unsuccessfully to get the czech to extend his expiring contract , and he can leave free of charge .
surprisingly , no one has yet grabbed drobny , who was among the top in his position for the past two seasons .
still there 's little chance that a keeper with aspirations of becoming the czech republic 's no. 1 is going to go down to the second division .
hertha will save his salary and try to find a cheaper replacement .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kacar is berlin 's most valuable asset one of two jewels in hertha 's midfield is gojko kacar .
the 23-year-old serbian enjoyed a fine season in 2008-9 and is rated at around 8.5 million euros .
a host of big european clubs including manchester united have reportedly had an eye on him in the past .
the dilemma for hertha is that kacar 's salary is relatively low and if he could be persuaded to give his all in the second division , he 's the sort of player who could help berlin get promoted .
on the other had , he had knee trouble this year so hertha might be wise to get big money for him straight away .
another hertha midfielder who could be of use to other teams is raffael .
the brazilian is a technically gifted playmaker who scored seven goals this season and is valued at 5.5 million .
berlin will no doubt try to keep raffael , their offensive leader , but he too brings with him a dilemma .
the main reason his value is n't higher is the sense that , for all his skill , he 's too small for the absolute top level .
that 's a weakness that could make him less effective in division two , where the play is more physical and the refereeing generally more lenient than in the german top flight .
neither kacar nor raffael has given an indication one way or the other of whether they 'd be willing to stay in berlin in division two and accept the salary cut that would entail .
hertha is likely to sell one in a bid to keep the other , but if the money were right , both could be sent packing to a generous new home .
the strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos did n't do badly at all for his first season in germany hertha have lots of forwards they would like to sell , but only one anyone is likely to want to buy : adrian ramos .
the colombian scored 10 goals this past season , despite only joining hertha late last summer and getting very little service worth the name .
that would suggest his estimated transfer worth of 3.5 million is an under-valuation .
arguing against a sale , from hertha 's perspective , is the fact they only own 80 percent of his transfer rights and will need a big , strong forward for the coming campaign in division two .
but rumors have swirled that ramos wants no part of life in lower-division german football , which could force hertha 's hand .
so no one will be surprised if ramos , or any of the other few stand-outs from hertha 's disastrous season , sign on with new employers in the coming weeks .
and that would make new coach markus babbel 's task all the tougher .

they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .
etfs are also a good way to invest in commodities , like gold .
" without an etf , i only have the option of buying gold coins , stash them away and hope no one burgles me - or i need a safe , " says cabras .

its xetra trading platform has a market share of 41 percent .
while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .

they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader bank 's robert halver rates etfs highly " etfs are wonderful possibility to invest in classical markets like german and american equity markets , even commodity markets , and , in fact , in direct comparison to mutual funds , the costs are less heavy , " robert halver , head of capital market research at baader bank told deutsche welle .
there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .
etfs are also a good way to invest in commodities , like gold .
" without an etf , i only have the option of buying gold coins , stash them away and hope no one burgles me - or i need a safe , " says cabras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors can use etfs to buy gold without physical ownership germany is europe 's etf trading hub deutsche boerse , the german stock exchange in frankfurt , is the main trading hub for etfs in europe .
its xetra trading platform has a market share of 41 percent .
while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .
" so , if we use that as a benchmark , i would not be too surprised if , in the next 10 years , the european market were to double in terms of assets under management , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade in etfs in germany is worth 13 billion euros per day fund manager fatigue the popularity of etfs can in part be explained by investors ' disappointment in actively-managed funds , which often struggle to outperform a benchmark index .
according to a recent study by gecam , an independent financial services provider that analyzed thousands of funds all over europe , three in four managed funds mirrored indices by up to 90 percent over the last three years .
critics say that means the main difference between some active funds and etfs is the fee structure .
etfs often perform just as well as managed funds and charge much lower fees , typically around 0.2-0.4 percent compared with 5 or 6 percent for classic funds .
increasingly complex funds around 90 percent of etfs traded on the german stock exchange are those replicating an index one to one by buying a basket of the underlying shares in that index .
but with the segment experiencing a boom , providers are now offering more sophisticated - or , some would say , riskier - products .
" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .
that means the shares in the dax are n't actually being bought for the etf - the money is invested elsewhere through those swaps .
that 's not good for private investors , " cabras from dsw advises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etfs are considered a safe and simple investment vehicle others point out that those tools are well-established in the financial markets and backed by ample liquidity .
" we 've seen definitely that monetary policy worldwide is pumping billions and billions of euros and dollars into the markets and thereby saving the whole financial markets , " halver says .

while etfs have been available in the us since 1993 , deutsche boerse introduced them to europe in april 2000 by offering trading in index funds based on pan-european blue chip indices like the eurostoxx 50 .
in 2001 , the first etf based on the dax became available on the exchange .
since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .

" there are etfs out there now who do not buy the underlying securities of the index but use complicated mathematical constructs like financial swaps .

they were launched in europe 10 years ago and have become increasingly popular in germany . investors looking for a safe and transparent way to invest their hard-earned cash are increasingly attracted to exchange-traded funds -lrb- etfs -rrb- , also known as index funds .
unlike actively managed funds that charge substantial fees , etfs are cost-effective , passive funds , meaning they do not require well-heeled fund managers poring over the best strategies to beat benchmark indices .
instead they simply replicate an index , like the main german share index dax , one to one .
they are considered low-risk and suitable for inexperienced as well as seasoned investors .

there are currently some 890 etfs to choose from in germany , which is roughly 100 more than in the united states , the birthplace of index funds .
funds based on the major indices are generally the most popular .
" the classic etf replicates a blue chip index like the dax , the eurostoxx or the dow jones and i would always recommend those to investors because they 're the classics with the highest liquidity , " marco cabras from the german association for the protection of investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- told deutsche welle .

since then , the total assets invested in etfs available in germany has risen from 400 million euros -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- to a hefty 134.6 billion euros , according to figures from deutsche boerse .
it is a trend that is expected to continue .
" if we take a look at the us market , which is more mature and has been around for longer , we see that assets under management of etfs have a market share of approximately 5 percent , while the same figure for europe is only 2 percent , " stephan kraus , vice president of deutsche börse 's market development team , told deutsche welle .

deutsche boerse advises investors to be aware of the strategies available , but kraus points out that the main growth in the etf markets will continue to come from classic etfs .
" investors will use those major , established plain vanilla etfs in order to get exposure to markets in a cost-effective way , " he told deutsche welle .

worth around £ 200m to british agriculture , their dramatic decline has become a cause of global concern .
bee part of it ! is a bbc project , supported by wildlife presenter kate humble , to create bee-friendly spaces .
" most of our wild honeybees have died out and we , as humans , are very dependent on bees to pollinate food crops , " said kate .
" i realised that by becoming a beekeeper i could do something really tangible to help the fairly desperate situation that our bee population has found itself in .

the project will help raise awareness of the threats facing local bees and offer opportunities to get involved .
" bee consciousness is vital and we want more people to understand the crucial role bees play in our food chain , " said matthew oates , the national trust 's advisor on nature conservation .
