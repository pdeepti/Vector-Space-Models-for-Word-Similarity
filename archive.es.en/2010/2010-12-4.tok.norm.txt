he spoke to deutsche welle about this unusual project . deutsche welle : when did your relationship with classical music start ? benyamin nuss : i grew up with classical and jazz music .
my dad is a jazz musician so i got to know both genres very early .
i knew beethoven , miles davis and frank sinatra as a child .
it was always my dream to be a pianist , an actor or a singer . tell us a bit about your new album . my album is called nuss plays uematsu and it contains video game music - something which nobody has done in this form before .
we got a lot of arrangers from russia , america , finland , who arranged the music of nobuo uematsu , who is one of the biggest composers for video game music .
he composed music for games like final fantasy , blue dragon and lost odyssey . it 's quite an unusual concept .
how did you come up with this idea ? actually , the idea started when i was maybe 13 or 14 years old .
i played final fantasy 10 with a friend and we were totally into this game and started downloading midi files from the internet and tried to play it on the piano .
the really concrete idea happened last year .
there was this video game concert in cologne with the wdr orchestra and in this concert the video game music was arranged for a big orchestra and a choir and it was so beautifully arranged .
that was when i thought , wow , you could also do that for solo piano . but was there another motive for making this album beyond re-interpreting computer game music ? i think video game music is still a world where people say , oh god , what is that ?
we went around and presented this concept of video game music because our goal with video game music is to get young people back to concerts and to interest young people in classical music .
the classical audience is getting older and older and we need young people to come to concerts . bildunterschrift : video game composer nobuo uematsu wrote a special composition for nuss ' new album there were certainly a lot of young faces at your recent berlin show at the berlin philharmonic .
did you notice that ? i was really pleased that a lot of young people were at the concert .
that makes me happy because the concept is working . a lot of young people are put off by classical music and write it off as old-fashioned and boring .
is there a way to encourage them to think otherwise ? i would say people who go to classical concerts are always totally amazed .
a lot of people just listen to some music on youtube and it 's totally different if you sit at a concert .
because there are a lot of people who share these emotions together and you do n't get that on youtube .
and also you see the artist on the stage , sweating and putting passion in to the instrument .
i think people who experience that will go to concerts more and more . you 're only 21 but already have a successful album out and are currently touring some of the best music halls in europe .
what ’ s next for benyamin nuss ? my goal is just to grow bigger as a musician , to learn as much as i can and to at different kinds of music .
i think what makes a good musician is a musician who is open to a lot of kinds of music .
i guess without music there is no life .
music is my passion and i want to do it the rest of my life .
there is so much to learn in music .
you always want to get better . by the way , are you still playing with your games console ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- at the moment i 'm playing final fantasy 13 but i ca n't play so many video games because i do n't have the time .

" we want to send a signal of support for political stabilization , " westerwelle told reporters .
" now is the right time to do that . "
westerwelle offered iraq " the closest of partnerships with germany , " as both sides signed an investment protection agreement .
traveling with the foreign minister was a business delegation .

since the fall of saddam hussein 's regime in 2003 , germany has supported the rebuilding of iraq with some 400 million euros , in addition to billions of euros of cancelled debts .
political deadlock westerwelle is the first foreign minister to visit iraq since elections on march 7 failed to produce a government .
the country has been in political disarray since , as the factions remain at loggerheads over the naming of a prime minister .
according to the iraqi constitution , acting prime minister maliki has until christmas to form a new cabinet .
security in iraq , in particular since the withdrawal of us troops three months ago , remains a major problem , with attacks increasing in frequency and intensity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 04.12.2010 young german pianist unites classical music with world of video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benyamin nuss first sat down at a piano at the tender age of two benyamin nuss , 21 , has been wowing audiences in some of europe 's finest concert halls with solo piano interpretations of video game music by nobuo uematsu .
he spoke to deutsche welle about this unusual project . deutsche welle : when did your relationship with classical music start ? benyamin nuss : i grew up with classical and jazz music .
my dad is a jazz musician so i got to know both genres very early .
i knew beethoven , miles davis and frank sinatra as a child .
it was always my dream to be a pianist , an actor or a singer . tell us a bit about your new album . my album is called nuss plays uematsu and it contains video game music - something which nobody has done in this form before .
we got a lot of arrangers from russia , america , finland , who arranged the music of nobuo uematsu , who is one of the biggest composers for video game music .
he composed music for games like final fantasy , blue dragon and lost odyssey . it 's quite an unusual concept .
how did you come up with this idea ? actually , the idea started when i was maybe 13 or 14 years old .
i played final fantasy 10 with a friend and we were totally into this game and started downloading midi files from the internet and tried to play it on the piano .
the really concrete idea happened last year .
there was this video game concert in cologne with the wdr orchestra and in this concert the video game music was arranged for a big orchestra and a choir and it was so beautifully arranged .
that was when i thought , wow , you could also do that for solo piano . but was there another motive for making this album beyond re-interpreting computer game music ? i think video game music is still a world where people say , oh god , what is that ?
we went around and presented this concept of video game music because our goal with video game music is to get young people back to concerts and to interest young people in classical music .
the classical audience is getting older and older and we need young people to come to concerts . bildunterschrift : video game composer nobuo uematsu wrote a special composition for nuss ' new album there were certainly a lot of young faces at your recent berlin show at the berlin philharmonic .
did you notice that ? i was really pleased that a lot of young people were at the concert .
that makes me happy because the concept is working . a lot of young people are put off by classical music and write it off as old-fashioned and boring .
is there a way to encourage them to think otherwise ? i would say people who go to classical concerts are always totally amazed .
a lot of people just listen to some music on youtube and it 's totally different if you sit at a concert .
because there are a lot of people who share these emotions together and you do n't get that on youtube .
and also you see the artist on the stage , sweating and putting passion in to the instrument .
i think people who experience that will go to concerts more and more . you 're only 21 but already have a successful album out and are currently touring some of the best music halls in europe .
what ’ s next for benyamin nuss ? my goal is just to grow bigger as a musician , to learn as much as i can and to at different kinds of music .
i think what makes a good musician is a musician who is open to a lot of kinds of music .
i guess without music there is no life .
music is my passion and i want to do it the rest of my life .
there is so much to learn in music .
you always want to get better . by the way , are you still playing with your games console ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- at the moment i 'm playing final fantasy 13 but i ca n't play so many video games because i do n't have the time .

he spoke to deutsche welle about this unusual project . deutsche welle : when did your relationship with classical music start ? benyamin nuss : i grew up with classical and jazz music .
my dad is a jazz musician so i got to know both genres very early .
i knew beethoven , miles davis and frank sinatra as a child .
it was always my dream to be a pianist , an actor or a singer . tell us a bit about your new album . my album is called nuss plays uematsu and it contains video game music - something which nobody has done in this form before .
we got a lot of arrangers from russia , america , finland , who arranged the music of nobuo uematsu , who is one of the biggest composers for video game music .
he composed music for games like final fantasy , blue dragon and lost odyssey . it 's quite an unusual concept .
how did you come up with this idea ? actually , the idea started when i was maybe 13 or 14 years old .
i played final fantasy 10 with a friend and we were totally into this game and started downloading midi files from the internet and tried to play it on the piano .
the really concrete idea happened last year .
there was this video game concert in cologne with the wdr orchestra and in this concert the video game music was arranged for a big orchestra and a choir and it was so beautifully arranged .
that was when i thought , wow , you could also do that for solo piano . but was there another motive for making this album beyond re-interpreting computer game music ? i think video game music is still a world where people say , oh god , what is that ?
we went around and presented this concept of video game music because our goal with video game music is to get young people back to concerts and to interest young people in classical music .
the classical audience is getting older and older and we need young people to come to concerts . bildunterschrift : video game composer nobuo uematsu wrote a special composition for nuss ' new album there were certainly a lot of young faces at your recent berlin show at the berlin philharmonic .
did you notice that ? i was really pleased that a lot of young people were at the concert .
that makes me happy because the concept is working . a lot of young people are put off by classical music and write it off as old-fashioned and boring .
is there a way to encourage them to think otherwise ? i would say people who go to classical concerts are always totally amazed .
a lot of people just listen to some music on youtube and it 's totally different if you sit at a concert .
because there are a lot of people who share these emotions together and you do n't get that on youtube .
and also you see the artist on the stage , sweating and putting passion in to the instrument .
i think people who experience that will go to concerts more and more . you 're only 21 but already have a successful album out and are currently touring some of the best music halls in europe .
what ’ s next for benyamin nuss ? my goal is just to grow bigger as a musician , to learn as much as i can and to at different kinds of music .
i think what makes a good musician is a musician who is open to a lot of kinds of music .
i guess without music there is no life .
music is my passion and i want to do it the rest of my life .

the man was taken into custody on december 1 when he arrived at the vienna airport from abroad .
he remains under arrest pending an expected request from belgium for his extradition .
" belgian authorities suspect a group of chechen extremists who were seeking to set up a religious state in northern chechnya planned to attack nato facilities in belgium , " said rudolf gollia , spokesman for the austrian interior ministry .
suspect linked to november 23 arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspect is believed to have ties to chechnya 's insurgent doku umarov the suspect slipped through the dragnet when police in belgium , germany and the netherlands swooped in on suspected plotters last month .
on november 23 , police in the three countries arrested at least 10 people suspected of links to a terror group behind the islamist website ansar al mujahideen .
according to local media , the man arrested in austria was a supporter of doku umarov , chief of the chechen rebel group caucasus emirate .
umarov has for years led an insurgency in chechnya with the goals shifting from independence from moscow to establishing a full-fledged islamist state across the caucasus region .
austria is home to a large chechen community of around 20,000 expatriates split between supporters of umarov and of pro-russian chechen president ramzan kadyrov .

he spoke to deutsche welle about this unusual project . deutsche welle : when did your relationship with classical music start ? benyamin nuss : i grew up with classical and jazz music .
my dad is a jazz musician so i got to know both genres very early .
i knew beethoven , miles davis and frank sinatra as a child .
it was always my dream to be a pianist , an actor or a singer . tell us a bit about your new album . my album is called nuss plays uematsu and it contains video game music - something which nobody has done in this form before .
we got a lot of arrangers from russia , america , finland , who arranged the music of nobuo uematsu , who is one of the biggest composers for video game music .
he composed music for games like final fantasy , blue dragon and lost odyssey . it 's quite an unusual concept .
how did you come up with this idea ? actually , the idea started when i was maybe 13 or 14 years old .
i played final fantasy 10 with a friend and we were totally into this game and started downloading midi files from the internet and tried to play it on the piano .
the really concrete idea happened last year .
there was this video game concert in cologne with the wdr orchestra and in this concert the video game music was arranged for a big orchestra and a choir and it was so beautifully arranged .
that was when i thought , wow , you could also do that for solo piano . but was there another motive for making this album beyond re-interpreting computer game music ? i think video game music is still a world where people say , oh god , what is that ?
we went around and presented this concept of video game music because our goal with video game music is to get young people back to concerts and to interest young people in classical music .
the classical audience is getting older and older and we need young people to come to concerts . bildunterschrift : video game composer nobuo uematsu wrote a special composition for nuss ' new album there were certainly a lot of young faces at your recent berlin show at the berlin philharmonic .
did you notice that ? i was really pleased that a lot of young people were at the concert .
that makes me happy because the concept is working . a lot of young people are put off by classical music and write it off as old-fashioned and boring .
is there a way to encourage them to think otherwise ? i would say people who go to classical concerts are always totally amazed .
a lot of people just listen to some music on youtube and it 's totally different if you sit at a concert .
because there are a lot of people who share these emotions together and you do n't get that on youtube .
and also you see the artist on the stage , sweating and putting passion in to the instrument .
i think people who experience that will go to concerts more and more . you 're only 21 but already have a successful album out and are currently touring some of the best music halls in europe .
what ’ s next for benyamin nuss ? my goal is just to grow bigger as a musician , to learn as much as i can and to at different kinds of music .
i think what makes a good musician is a musician who is open to a lot of kinds of music .
i guess without music there is no life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 04.12.2010 ' pure chocolate ' label must go , eu tells italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian chocolatiers take pride in using pure chocolate their chocolate may be sweet but italian chocolatiers are bitter over a european union label ruling . last week , italy lost its battle with the european commission when the court of justice ruled that its use of the words " pure chocolate " on product packaging breaks eu law .
in 1999 , european legislation was passed , allowing producers to add up to 5 percent vegetable fat and still call their product “ chocolate . ”
the legislation , which was approved by italy at the time , sparked anger among those who consider that the only fat contained in chocolate should be cocoa butter .
they criticized the eu for favoring large industrial producers over food quality .
in the wake of these reactions , italy introduced its own national law , which permitted the wording “ pure chocolate ” – marked clearly on the front of products that contain only cocoa butter .
but the high court 's decision that the label breaches eu law means italian chocolate producers will now have to take the wording off their packaging .
chocolate purist frustration giordano monticelli , who works for the florentine chocolate producer becagli , said chocolatiers are furious about the decision .
“ for the umpteenth time the big distributors and multinationals have overshadowed those in italy and other countries who are the true chocolate makers , ” he said while offering samples of becagli products to visitors at " cioccoshow , " a five-day chocolate fair held in the northern italian city of bologna .
“ we are totally against the use of vegetable oils in chocolate production . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cioccoshow in bologna is a five-day chocolate trade fair manuele gardini , who helps run a family chocolate-making business in the nearby city of forlì , is more philosophical : “ if this is a definitive decision , we 'll have to take these words off our labels .
maybe it 's not such a big deal as consumers just need to turn the bar over and read the ingredients on the back , ” he said , adding that the label was useful for small producers like him to promote more expensive but higher quality products : “ to be able to write ' pure chocolate ' on the front gives a much more direct message . ”
italy 's national confederation of artisans -lrb- cna -rrb- was also disappointed by the ruling , which now makes competition even harder .
“ industrial producers are given an even bigger advantage as they have huge budgets and can spend a lot of money on advertising , ” said francesco de dominicis , head of the cna 's food section in bologna .
“ small producers ca n't .
the label was a way of putting everyone on the same level . ”
although by eu law all producers have to list every ingredient on the back of packaging , de dominicis claims this is n't sufficient .
“ all they have to do is write the ingredients in six languages and it ends up being so small you ca n't even read them with a magnifying glass , ” he said ecuadorean cocoa importer , jorge felix , agrees that the ruling is detrimental to clarity of information to consumers . the " pure chocolate " label , he argues , helps consumers identify chocolate made without any added vegetable oils .
“ cocoa butter is expensive compared to other oils but cocoa butter is a natural oil … and it 's cocoa , ” felix said , adding that it is a question not only of purism but also of health : “ most of the time , these are hydrogenated oils that are not good for you and can lead to heart disease and liver problems . ”
ethical implications european union permission to substitute up to 5 percent of cocoa butter with vegetable oils has saved the region 's chocolate industry millions of euros .
as well as the cost to consumer health , de dominicis claims the impact on cocoa-producing countries is immense : “ one percent less cocoa butter in the final product corresponds with 100 million dollars lost by those countries that produce cocoa , " he said .
" two percent less is devastating to economies like ivory coast and ghana . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bologna event is a chocolate lover 's paradise the ruling against italy 's pure chocolate label , de dominicis added , was shameful and another example of the eu bowing down to “ multinationals that do n't care about the economy of poor and under-developed countries . ”
felix , who works closely with cocoa plantations in ecuador , explained that when cocoa beans are pressed , they produce cocoa butter and cocoa powder in almost equal parts .
“ you have butter regardless , so if you do n't sell everything you have to lower the price and sell to other industries like cosmetics , ” he said .
european awareness felix would like europe 's larger chocolate manufacturers to assume more responsibility for protecting poorer nations ' economies and ensuring quality .
in the meantime , he believes the most important step is to educate european consumers “ so they understand what a good chocolate is – meaning the source , the way it was processed and many other things .
at least you , as a consumer , then have the power to choose . ”
felix is also very pleased to see italian artisanal chocolate producers working together to import ethically sourced , high quality cocoa .
the fine chocolate association of italy , which now includes around 60 small companies , uses events like bologna 's cioccoshow to talk directly to the public .
“ word of mouth is basically what gives us the power when you do n't have the money to make a huge advertising campaign , ” felix explained , “ and if you do it here in italy , germany and other countries , your voice will be heard . ”

he also downplayed significance of the affair . philip murphy , ambassador for the united states in berlin , rejected on saturday criticism that he has failed in his handling of the wikileaks scandal .
he told german daily hamburger abendblatt in an interview published on saturday that demands for his recall were " unfounded . "
" it 's up to the united states government to decide how to protect its interests in germany in the face of -lsb- the wikileaks publication -rsb- , " murphy said , adding " but i 'm not going anywhere . "
a government spokesman said late on friday that berlin had no intention of recalling murphy over the affair , adding that such an action would be unjustified .
embarrassing revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murphy described westerwelle as " a wild card " and " short on substance " in the leaked documents , released to the public by wikileaks last sunday , murphy was quoted making critical remarks about german foreign minister guido westerwelle , calling him " short on substance " and " a wild card . "
it was also brought to light that murphy gained information at closed-door coalition talks in 2009 from an informant belonging to merkel 's junior coalition partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the informant was 41-year-old helmut metzner , whom murphy described as an " up-and-coming -lsb- fpd -rsb- loyalist " who related the sensitive information from notes he had taken during the talks .
consequences ' exaggerated ' several senior german politicians have questioned murphy 's handling of the diplomatic faux pas .
hans-michael goldmann , also of the fdp , pointed out that murphy has yet to apologize to the german parliament for the embarrassing comments he made .
though angered by the publication of the documents , murphy dismissed the affair as something that would soon blow over .
" in the short term , we are in a very difficult situation , " he conceded to the hamburger abendblatt .
" but with regard to any lasting consequences , this affair is being completely exaggerated .
several people were hurt by the statements that were released , but we have to return to our work - and i 've already begun to do this . "

in 1999 , european legislation was passed , allowing producers to add up to 5 percent vegetable fat and still call their product “ chocolate . ”
the legislation , which was approved by italy at the time , sparked anger among those who consider that the only fat contained in chocolate should be cocoa butter .
they criticized the eu for favoring large industrial producers over food quality .
in the wake of these reactions , italy introduced its own national law , which permitted the wording “ pure chocolate ” – marked clearly on the front of products that contain only cocoa butter .
but the high court 's decision that the label breaches eu law means italian chocolate producers will now have to take the wording off their packaging .
chocolate purist frustration giordano monticelli , who works for the florentine chocolate producer becagli , said chocolatiers are furious about the decision .
“ for the umpteenth time the big distributors and multinationals have overshadowed those in italy and other countries who are the true chocolate makers , ” he said while offering samples of becagli products to visitors at " cioccoshow , " a five-day chocolate fair held in the northern italian city of bologna .
“ we are totally against the use of vegetable oils in chocolate production . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cioccoshow in bologna is a five-day chocolate trade fair manuele gardini , who helps run a family chocolate-making business in the nearby city of forlì , is more philosophical : “ if this is a definitive decision , we 'll have to take these words off our labels .
maybe it 's not such a big deal as consumers just need to turn the bar over and read the ingredients on the back , ” he said , adding that the label was useful for small producers like him to promote more expensive but higher quality products : “ to be able to write ' pure chocolate ' on the front gives a much more direct message . ”
italy 's national confederation of artisans -lrb- cna -rrb- was also disappointed by the ruling , which now makes competition even harder .
“ industrial producers are given an even bigger advantage as they have huge budgets and can spend a lot of money on advertising , ” said francesco de dominicis , head of the cna 's food section in bologna .
“ small producers ca n't .
the label was a way of putting everyone on the same level . ”
although by eu law all producers have to list every ingredient on the back of packaging , de dominicis claims this is n't sufficient .

the man was taken into custody on december 1 when he arrived at the vienna airport from abroad .
he remains under arrest pending an expected request from belgium for his extradition .

bayern munich suffer yet another setback . borussia dortmund will cruise as number one into the second leg of this year 's bundesliga season .
following mainz 's defeat to frankfurt on saturday , dortmund now have a big enough lead to secure their position at the top going into 2011 .
in saturday 's game , mainz crashed 2-1 at eintracht frankfurt with league top scorer theofanis gekas and marco russ securing goals for frankfurt .
andre schuerrle managed to put a temporary equalizer into the net but in the end mainz did n't have it in them to beat frankfurt .
both gekas and schuerrle scored their goals from the penalty spot , but frankfurt dominated most of the game and so took home a well-deserved victory .

" i have never seen a trophy that said : ' autumn champion ' . "
yet another setback for munich later on saturday , defending champions bayern munich suffered yet another blow to their hopes of retaining the trophy as they were handed a 2-0 defeat by schalke .
both sides went into halftime without a goal even though bayern came close to taking the lead when both mario gomez and franck ribery only just failed to get the ball past schalke goalie manuel neuer .
after the break , schalke was better in taking advantage of their chances .
spanish midfielder jose manual juardo opened scoring 12 minutes into the second half .
only 10 minutes later , schalke 's benedikt hoewedes was left unmarked in the middle of the penalty area and did n't hesitate to head the ball safely into the net .
bayern are now trailing dortmund by 14 points .

he spoke to deutsche welle about this unusual project . deutsche welle : when did your relationship with classical music start ? benyamin nuss : i grew up with classical and jazz music .
my dad is a jazz musician so i got to know both genres very early .
i knew beethoven , miles davis and frank sinatra as a child .
it was always my dream to be a pianist , an actor or a singer . tell us a bit about your new album . my album is called nuss plays uematsu and it contains video game music - something which nobody has done in this form before .
we got a lot of arrangers from russia , america , finland , who arranged the music of nobuo uematsu , who is one of the biggest composers for video game music .
he composed music for games like final fantasy , blue dragon and lost odyssey . it 's quite an unusual concept .
how did you come up with this idea ? actually , the idea started when i was maybe 13 or 14 years old .
i played final fantasy 10 with a friend and we were totally into this game and started downloading midi files from the internet and tried to play it on the piano .
the really concrete idea happened last year .
there was this video game concert in cologne with the wdr orchestra and in this concert the video game music was arranged for a big orchestra and a choir and it was so beautifully arranged .
that was when i thought , wow , you could also do that for solo piano . but was there another motive for making this album beyond re-interpreting computer game music ? i think video game music is still a world where people say , oh god , what is that ?
we went around and presented this concept of video game music because our goal with video game music is to get young people back to concerts and to interest young people in classical music .
the classical audience is getting older and older and we need young people to come to concerts . bildunterschrift : video game composer nobuo uematsu wrote a special composition for nuss ' new album there were certainly a lot of young faces at your recent berlin show at the berlin philharmonic .
did you notice that ? i was really pleased that a lot of young people were at the concert .
that makes me happy because the concept is working . a lot of young people are put off by classical music and write it off as old-fashioned and boring .
is there a way to encourage them to think otherwise ? i would say people who go to classical concerts are always totally amazed .
a lot of people just listen to some music on youtube and it 's totally different if you sit at a concert .
because there are a lot of people who share these emotions together and you do n't get that on youtube .
and also you see the artist on the stage , sweating and putting passion in to the instrument .
i think people who experience that will go to concerts more and more . you 're only 21 but already have a successful album out and are currently touring some of the best music halls in europe .
what ’ s next for benyamin nuss ? my goal is just to grow bigger as a musician , to learn as much as i can and to at different kinds of music .
i think what makes a good musician is a musician who is open to a lot of kinds of music .
i guess without music there is no life .
music is my passion and i want to do it the rest of my life .
there is so much to learn in music .
you always want to get better . by the way , are you still playing with your games console ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- at the moment i 'm playing final fantasy 13 but i ca n't play so many video games because i do n't have the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 04.12.2010 ' pure chocolate ' label must go , eu tells italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian chocolatiers take pride in using pure chocolate their chocolate may be sweet but italian chocolatiers are bitter over a european union label ruling . last week , italy lost its battle with the european commission when the court of justice ruled that its use of the words " pure chocolate " on product packaging breaks eu law .
in 1999 , european legislation was passed , allowing producers to add up to 5 percent vegetable fat and still call their product “ chocolate . ”
the legislation , which was approved by italy at the time , sparked anger among those who consider that the only fat contained in chocolate should be cocoa butter .
they criticized the eu for favoring large industrial producers over food quality .
in the wake of these reactions , italy introduced its own national law , which permitted the wording “ pure chocolate ” – marked clearly on the front of products that contain only cocoa butter .
but the high court 's decision that the label breaches eu law means italian chocolate producers will now have to take the wording off their packaging .
chocolate purist frustration giordano monticelli , who works for the florentine chocolate producer becagli , said chocolatiers are furious about the decision .
“ for the umpteenth time the big distributors and multinationals have overshadowed those in italy and other countries who are the true chocolate makers , ” he said while offering samples of becagli products to visitors at " cioccoshow , " a five-day chocolate fair held in the northern italian city of bologna .
“ we are totally against the use of vegetable oils in chocolate production . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cioccoshow in bologna is a five-day chocolate trade fair manuele gardini , who helps run a family chocolate-making business in the nearby city of forlì , is more philosophical : “ if this is a definitive decision , we 'll have to take these words off our labels .
maybe it 's not such a big deal as consumers just need to turn the bar over and read the ingredients on the back , ” he said , adding that the label was useful for small producers like him to promote more expensive but higher quality products : “ to be able to write ' pure chocolate ' on the front gives a much more direct message . ”
italy 's national confederation of artisans -lrb- cna -rrb- was also disappointed by the ruling , which now makes competition even harder .
“ industrial producers are given an even bigger advantage as they have huge budgets and can spend a lot of money on advertising , ” said francesco de dominicis , head of the cna 's food section in bologna .
“ small producers ca n't .
the label was a way of putting everyone on the same level . ”
although by eu law all producers have to list every ingredient on the back of packaging , de dominicis claims this is n't sufficient .
“ all they have to do is write the ingredients in six languages and it ends up being so small you ca n't even read them with a magnifying glass , ” he said ecuadorean cocoa importer , jorge felix , agrees that the ruling is detrimental to clarity of information to consumers . the " pure chocolate " label , he argues , helps consumers identify chocolate made without any added vegetable oils .
“ cocoa butter is expensive compared to other oils but cocoa butter is a natural oil … and it 's cocoa , ” felix said , adding that it is a question not only of purism but also of health : “ most of the time , these are hydrogenated oils that are not good for you and can lead to heart disease and liver problems . ”
ethical implications european union permission to substitute up to 5 percent of cocoa butter with vegetable oils has saved the region 's chocolate industry millions of euros .
as well as the cost to consumer health , de dominicis claims the impact on cocoa-producing countries is immense : “ one percent less cocoa butter in the final product corresponds with 100 million dollars lost by those countries that produce cocoa , " he said .
" two percent less is devastating to economies like ivory coast and ghana . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bologna event is a chocolate lover 's paradise the ruling against italy 's pure chocolate label , de dominicis added , was shameful and another example of the eu bowing down to “ multinationals that do n't care about the economy of poor and under-developed countries . ”
felix , who works closely with cocoa plantations in ecuador , explained that when cocoa beans are pressed , they produce cocoa butter and cocoa powder in almost equal parts .
“ you have butter regardless , so if you do n't sell everything you have to lower the price and sell to other industries like cosmetics , ” he said .
european awareness felix would like europe 's larger chocolate manufacturers to assume more responsibility for protecting poorer nations ' economies and ensuring quality .
in the meantime , he believes the most important step is to educate european consumers “ so they understand what a good chocolate is – meaning the source , the way it was processed and many other things .
at least you , as a consumer , then have the power to choose . ”
felix is also very pleased to see italian artisanal chocolate producers working together to import ethically sourced , high quality cocoa .
the fine chocolate association of italy , which now includes around 60 small companies , uses events like bologna 's cioccoshow to talk directly to the public .
“ word of mouth is basically what gives us the power when you do n't have the money to make a huge advertising campaign , ” felix explained , “ and if you do it here in italy , germany and other countries , your voice will be heard . ”

he is the first western foreign minister to visit the embattled nation since inconclusive march elections . german foreign minister guido westerwelle made an unannounced visit to baghdad on saturday where he held talks with president jalal talabani , prime minister nuri al-maliki and other parliamentary leaders .
the talks focused on politics , as maliki works to form a cabinet nearly nine months after elections .
" we want to send a signal of support for political stabilization , " westerwelle told reporters .
" now is the right time to do that . "
westerwelle offered iraq " the closest of partnerships with germany , " as both sides signed an investment protection agreement .
traveling with the foreign minister was a business delegation .
maliki told westerwelle that baghdad wanted to see greater involvement by germany companies in iraq .
investors , however , cautioned that any involvement was due to only make slow progress because of the country 's volatile security situation .
enormous potential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sees enormous potential in the iraqi economy westerwelle told the german daily frankfurter rundschau before his departure that the growth potential for german companies in iraq was " enormous . "
in the first nine months of this year , german companies exported goods to iraq in excess of 700 million euros -lrb- $ 940 million -rrb- , compared to 400 million euros during the same period last year .
since the fall of saddam hussein 's regime in 2003 , germany has supported the rebuilding of iraq with some 400 million euros , in addition to billions of euros of cancelled debts .
political deadlock westerwelle is the first foreign minister to visit iraq since elections on march 7 failed to produce a government .
the country has been in political disarray since , as the factions remain at loggerheads over the naming of a prime minister .
according to the iraqi constitution , acting prime minister maliki has until christmas to form a new cabinet .
security in iraq , in particular since the withdrawal of us troops three months ago , remains a major problem , with attacks increasing in frequency and intensity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 04.12.2010 young german pianist unites classical music with world of video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benyamin nuss first sat down at a piano at the tender age of two benyamin nuss , 21 , has been wowing audiences in some of europe 's finest concert halls with solo piano interpretations of video game music by nobuo uematsu .
he spoke to deutsche welle about this unusual project . deutsche welle : when did your relationship with classical music start ? benyamin nuss : i grew up with classical and jazz music .
my dad is a jazz musician so i got to know both genres very early .
i knew beethoven , miles davis and frank sinatra as a child .
it was always my dream to be a pianist , an actor or a singer . tell us a bit about your new album . my album is called nuss plays uematsu and it contains video game music - something which nobody has done in this form before .
we got a lot of arrangers from russia , america , finland , who arranged the music of nobuo uematsu , who is one of the biggest composers for video game music .
he composed music for games like final fantasy , blue dragon and lost odyssey . it 's quite an unusual concept .
how did you come up with this idea ? actually , the idea started when i was maybe 13 or 14 years old .
i played final fantasy 10 with a friend and we were totally into this game and started downloading midi files from the internet and tried to play it on the piano .
the really concrete idea happened last year .
there was this video game concert in cologne with the wdr orchestra and in this concert the video game music was arranged for a big orchestra and a choir and it was so beautifully arranged .
that was when i thought , wow , you could also do that for solo piano . but was there another motive for making this album beyond re-interpreting computer game music ? i think video game music is still a world where people say , oh god , what is that ?
we went around and presented this concept of video game music because our goal with video game music is to get young people back to concerts and to interest young people in classical music .
the classical audience is getting older and older and we need young people to come to concerts . bildunterschrift : video game composer nobuo uematsu wrote a special composition for nuss ' new album there were certainly a lot of young faces at your recent berlin show at the berlin philharmonic .
did you notice that ? i was really pleased that a lot of young people were at the concert .
that makes me happy because the concept is working . a lot of young people are put off by classical music and write it off as old-fashioned and boring .
is there a way to encourage them to think otherwise ? i would say people who go to classical concerts are always totally amazed .
a lot of people just listen to some music on youtube and it 's totally different if you sit at a concert .
because there are a lot of people who share these emotions together and you do n't get that on youtube .
and also you see the artist on the stage , sweating and putting passion in to the instrument .
i think people who experience that will go to concerts more and more . you 're only 21 but already have a successful album out and are currently touring some of the best music halls in europe .
what ’ s next for benyamin nuss ? my goal is just to grow bigger as a musician , to learn as much as i can and to at different kinds of music .
i think what makes a good musician is a musician who is open to a lot of kinds of music .
i guess without music there is no life .
music is my passion and i want to do it the rest of my life .
there is so much to learn in music .
you always want to get better . by the way , are you still playing with your games console ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- at the moment i 'm playing final fantasy 13 but i ca n't play so many video games because i do n't have the time .

the man was taken into custody on december 1 when he arrived at the vienna airport from abroad .
he remains under arrest pending an expected request from belgium for his extradition .

according to local media , the man arrested in austria was a supporter of doku umarov , chief of the chechen rebel group caucasus emirate .
umarov has for years led an insurgency in chechnya with the goals shifting from independence from moscow to establishing a full-fledged islamist state across the caucasus region .
austria is home to a large chechen community of around 20,000 expatriates split between supporters of umarov and of pro-russian chechen president ramzan kadyrov .

bayern munich suffer yet another setback . borussia dortmund will cruise as number one into the second leg of this year 's bundesliga season .
following mainz 's defeat to frankfurt on saturday , dortmund now have a big enough lead to secure their position at the top going into 2011 .
in saturday 's game , mainz crashed 2-1 at eintracht frankfurt with league top scorer theofanis gekas and marco russ securing goals for frankfurt .
andre schuerrle managed to put a temporary equalizer into the net but in the end mainz did n't have it in them to beat frankfurt .
both gekas and schuerrle scored their goals from the penalty spot , but frankfurt dominated most of the game and so took home a well-deserved victory .

after the break , schalke was better in taking advantage of their chances .
spanish midfielder jose manual juardo opened scoring 12 minutes into the second half .
only 10 minutes later , schalke 's benedikt hoewedes was left unmarked in the middle of the penalty area and did n't hesitate to head the ball safely into the net .
bayern are now trailing dortmund by 14 points .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 04.12.2010 ' pure chocolate ' label must go , eu tells italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian chocolatiers take pride in using pure chocolate their chocolate may be sweet but italian chocolatiers are bitter over a european union label ruling . last week , italy lost its battle with the european commission when the court of justice ruled that its use of the words " pure chocolate " on product packaging breaks eu law .
in 1999 , european legislation was passed , allowing producers to add up to 5 percent vegetable fat and still call their product “ chocolate . ”
the legislation , which was approved by italy at the time , sparked anger among those who consider that the only fat contained in chocolate should be cocoa butter .
they criticized the eu for favoring large industrial producers over food quality .
in the wake of these reactions , italy introduced its own national law , which permitted the wording “ pure chocolate ” – marked clearly on the front of products that contain only cocoa butter .
but the high court 's decision that the label breaches eu law means italian chocolate producers will now have to take the wording off their packaging .
chocolate purist frustration giordano monticelli , who works for the florentine chocolate producer becagli , said chocolatiers are furious about the decision .
“ for the umpteenth time the big distributors and multinationals have overshadowed those in italy and other countries who are the true chocolate makers , ” he said while offering samples of becagli products to visitors at " cioccoshow , " a five-day chocolate fair held in the northern italian city of bologna .
“ we are totally against the use of vegetable oils in chocolate production . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cioccoshow in bologna is a five-day chocolate trade fair manuele gardini , who helps run a family chocolate-making business in the nearby city of forlì , is more philosophical : “ if this is a definitive decision , we 'll have to take these words off our labels .
maybe it 's not such a big deal as consumers just need to turn the bar over and read the ingredients on the back , ” he said , adding that the label was useful for small producers like him to promote more expensive but higher quality products : “ to be able to write ' pure chocolate ' on the front gives a much more direct message . ”
italy 's national confederation of artisans -lrb- cna -rrb- was also disappointed by the ruling , which now makes competition even harder .
“ industrial producers are given an even bigger advantage as they have huge budgets and can spend a lot of money on advertising , ” said francesco de dominicis , head of the cna 's food section in bologna .
“ small producers ca n't .
the label was a way of putting everyone on the same level . ”
although by eu law all producers have to list every ingredient on the back of packaging , de dominicis claims this is n't sufficient .
“ all they have to do is write the ingredients in six languages and it ends up being so small you ca n't even read them with a magnifying glass , ” he said ecuadorean cocoa importer , jorge felix , agrees that the ruling is detrimental to clarity of information to consumers . the " pure chocolate " label , he argues , helps consumers identify chocolate made without any added vegetable oils .
“ cocoa butter is expensive compared to other oils but cocoa butter is a natural oil … and it 's cocoa , ” felix said , adding that it is a question not only of purism but also of health : “ most of the time , these are hydrogenated oils that are not good for you and can lead to heart disease and liver problems . ”
ethical implications european union permission to substitute up to 5 percent of cocoa butter with vegetable oils has saved the region 's chocolate industry millions of euros .
as well as the cost to consumer health , de dominicis claims the impact on cocoa-producing countries is immense : “ one percent less cocoa butter in the final product corresponds with 100 million dollars lost by those countries that produce cocoa , " he said .
" two percent less is devastating to economies like ivory coast and ghana . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bologna event is a chocolate lover 's paradise the ruling against italy 's pure chocolate label , de dominicis added , was shameful and another example of the eu bowing down to “ multinationals that do n't care about the economy of poor and under-developed countries . ”
felix , who works closely with cocoa plantations in ecuador , explained that when cocoa beans are pressed , they produce cocoa butter and cocoa powder in almost equal parts .
“ you have butter regardless , so if you do n't sell everything you have to lower the price and sell to other industries like cosmetics , ” he said .
european awareness felix would like europe 's larger chocolate manufacturers to assume more responsibility for protecting poorer nations ' economies and ensuring quality .
in the meantime , he believes the most important step is to educate european consumers “ so they understand what a good chocolate is – meaning the source , the way it was processed and many other things .
at least you , as a consumer , then have the power to choose . ”
felix is also very pleased to see italian artisanal chocolate producers working together to import ethically sourced , high quality cocoa .
the fine chocolate association of italy , which now includes around 60 small companies , uses events like bologna 's cioccoshow to talk directly to the public .
“ word of mouth is basically what gives us the power when you do n't have the money to make a huge advertising campaign , ” felix explained , “ and if you do it here in italy , germany and other countries , your voice will be heard . ”

he spoke to deutsche welle about this unusual project . deutsche welle : when did your relationship with classical music start ? benyamin nuss : i grew up with classical and jazz music .
my dad is a jazz musician so i got to know both genres very early .
i knew beethoven , miles davis and frank sinatra as a child .
it was always my dream to be a pianist , an actor or a singer . tell us a bit about your new album . my album is called nuss plays uematsu and it contains video game music - something which nobody has done in this form before .
we got a lot of arrangers from russia , america , finland , who arranged the music of nobuo uematsu , who is one of the biggest composers for video game music .
he composed music for games like final fantasy , blue dragon and lost odyssey . it 's quite an unusual concept .
how did you come up with this idea ? actually , the idea started when i was maybe 13 or 14 years old .
i played final fantasy 10 with a friend and we were totally into this game and started downloading midi files from the internet and tried to play it on the piano .
the really concrete idea happened last year .
there was this video game concert in cologne with the wdr orchestra and in this concert the video game music was arranged for a big orchestra and a choir and it was so beautifully arranged .
that was when i thought , wow , you could also do that for solo piano . but was there another motive for making this album beyond re-interpreting computer game music ? i think video game music is still a world where people say , oh god , what is that ?
we went around and presented this concept of video game music because our goal with video game music is to get young people back to concerts and to interest young people in classical music .
the classical audience is getting older and older and we need young people to come to concerts . bildunterschrift : video game composer nobuo uematsu wrote a special composition for nuss ' new album there were certainly a lot of young faces at your recent berlin show at the berlin philharmonic .
did you notice that ? i was really pleased that a lot of young people were at the concert .
that makes me happy because the concept is working . a lot of young people are put off by classical music and write it off as old-fashioned and boring .
is there a way to encourage them to think otherwise ? i would say people who go to classical concerts are always totally amazed .
a lot of people just listen to some music on youtube and it 's totally different if you sit at a concert .
because there are a lot of people who share these emotions together and you do n't get that on youtube .
and also you see the artist on the stage , sweating and putting passion in to the instrument .
i think people who experience that will go to concerts more and more . you 're only 21 but already have a successful album out and are currently touring some of the best music halls in europe .
what ’ s next for benyamin nuss ? my goal is just to grow bigger as a musician , to learn as much as i can and to at different kinds of music .
i think what makes a good musician is a musician who is open to a lot of kinds of music .
i guess without music there is no life .
music is my passion and i want to do it the rest of my life .
there is so much to learn in music .
you always want to get better . by the way , are you still playing with your games console ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- at the moment i 'm playing final fantasy 13 but i ca n't play so many video games because i do n't have the time .

he is the first western foreign minister to visit the embattled nation since inconclusive march elections . german foreign minister guido westerwelle made an unannounced visit to baghdad on saturday where he held talks with president jalal talabani , prime minister nuri al-maliki and other parliamentary leaders .
the talks focused on politics , as maliki works to form a cabinet nearly nine months after elections .
" we want to send a signal of support for political stabilization , " westerwelle told reporters .
" now is the right time to do that . "
westerwelle offered iraq " the closest of partnerships with germany , " as both sides signed an investment protection agreement .
traveling with the foreign minister was a business delegation .
maliki told westerwelle that baghdad wanted to see greater involvement by germany companies in iraq .
investors , however , cautioned that any involvement was due to only make slow progress because of the country 's volatile security situation .
enormous potential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sees enormous potential in the iraqi economy westerwelle told the german daily frankfurter rundschau before his departure that the growth potential for german companies in iraq was " enormous . "
in the first nine months of this year , german companies exported goods to iraq in excess of 700 million euros -lrb- $ 940 million -rrb- , compared to 400 million euros during the same period last year .
since the fall of saddam hussein 's regime in 2003 , germany has supported the rebuilding of iraq with some 400 million euros , in addition to billions of euros of cancelled debts .
political deadlock westerwelle is the first foreign minister to visit iraq since elections on march 7 failed to produce a government .
the country has been in political disarray since , as the factions remain at loggerheads over the naming of a prime minister .
according to the iraqi constitution , acting prime minister maliki has until christmas to form a new cabinet .
security in iraq , in particular since the withdrawal of us troops three months ago , remains a major problem , with attacks increasing in frequency and intensity .

in 1999 , european legislation was passed , allowing producers to add up to 5 percent vegetable fat and still call their product “ chocolate . ”
the legislation , which was approved by italy at the time , sparked anger among those who consider that the only fat contained in chocolate should be cocoa butter .
they criticized the eu for favoring large industrial producers over food quality .
in the wake of these reactions , italy introduced its own national law , which permitted the wording “ pure chocolate ” – marked clearly on the front of products that contain only cocoa butter .
but the high court 's decision that the label breaches eu law means italian chocolate producers will now have to take the wording off their packaging .
chocolate purist frustration giordano monticelli , who works for the florentine chocolate producer becagli , said chocolatiers are furious about the decision .
“ for the umpteenth time the big distributors and multinationals have overshadowed those in italy and other countries who are the true chocolate makers , ” he said while offering samples of becagli products to visitors at " cioccoshow , " a five-day chocolate fair held in the northern italian city of bologna .
“ we are totally against the use of vegetable oils in chocolate production . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cioccoshow in bologna is a five-day chocolate trade fair manuele gardini , who helps run a family chocolate-making business in the nearby city of forlì , is more philosophical : “ if this is a definitive decision , we 'll have to take these words off our labels .
maybe it 's not such a big deal as consumers just need to turn the bar over and read the ingredients on the back , ” he said , adding that the label was useful for small producers like him to promote more expensive but higher quality products : “ to be able to write ' pure chocolate ' on the front gives a much more direct message . ”
italy 's national confederation of artisans -lrb- cna -rrb- was also disappointed by the ruling , which now makes competition even harder .
“ industrial producers are given an even bigger advantage as they have huge budgets and can spend a lot of money on advertising , ” said francesco de dominicis , head of the cna 's food section in bologna .
“ small producers ca n't .
the label was a way of putting everyone on the same level . ”
although by eu law all producers have to list every ingredient on the back of packaging , de dominicis claims this is n't sufficient .
“ all they have to do is write the ingredients in six languages and it ends up being so small you ca n't even read them with a magnifying glass , ” he said ecuadorean cocoa importer , jorge felix , agrees that the ruling is detrimental to clarity of information to consumers . the " pure chocolate " label , he argues , helps consumers identify chocolate made without any added vegetable oils .
“ cocoa butter is expensive compared to other oils but cocoa butter is a natural oil … and it 's cocoa , ” felix said , adding that it is a question not only of purism but also of health : “ most of the time , these are hydrogenated oils that are not good for you and can lead to heart disease and liver problems . ”
ethical implications european union permission to substitute up to 5 percent of cocoa butter with vegetable oils has saved the region 's chocolate industry millions of euros .
as well as the cost to consumer health , de dominicis claims the impact on cocoa-producing countries is immense : “ one percent less cocoa butter in the final product corresponds with 100 million dollars lost by those countries that produce cocoa , " he said .
" two percent less is devastating to economies like ivory coast and ghana . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bologna event is a chocolate lover 's paradise the ruling against italy 's pure chocolate label , de dominicis added , was shameful and another example of the eu bowing down to “ multinationals that do n't care about the economy of poor and under-developed countries . ”
felix , who works closely with cocoa plantations in ecuador , explained that when cocoa beans are pressed , they produce cocoa butter and cocoa powder in almost equal parts .
“ you have butter regardless , so if you do n't sell everything you have to lower the price and sell to other industries like cosmetics , ” he said .
european awareness felix would like europe 's larger chocolate manufacturers to assume more responsibility for protecting poorer nations ' economies and ensuring quality .
in the meantime , he believes the most important step is to educate european consumers “ so they understand what a good chocolate is – meaning the source , the way it was processed and many other things .
at least you , as a consumer , then have the power to choose . ”
felix is also very pleased to see italian artisanal chocolate producers working together to import ethically sourced , high quality cocoa .
the fine chocolate association of italy , which now includes around 60 small companies , uses events like bologna 's cioccoshow to talk directly to the public .
“ word of mouth is basically what gives us the power when you do n't have the money to make a huge advertising campaign , ” felix explained , “ and if you do it here in italy , germany and other countries , your voice will be heard . ”
