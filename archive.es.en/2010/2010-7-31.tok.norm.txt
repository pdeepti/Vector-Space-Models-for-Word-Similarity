program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de poland -pipe- 31.07.2010 poland divided over plan to move kaczynski cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to remove the cross have sparked a heated debate the death of president lech kaczynski and many of poland 's political elite in a plane crash united a nation in grief in april .
now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .

and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de poland -pipe- 31.07.2010 poland divided over plan to move kaczynski cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to remove the cross have sparked a heated debate the death of president lech kaczynski and many of poland 's political elite in a plane crash united a nation in grief in april .
now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 31.07.2010 cologne gears up to play and party as host to gay games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay games welcome men and women , gay or straight cologne is home to one of the largest and most active lesbian and gay communities in all of germany .
on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 31.07.2010 the ever-present war in southern lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still there - even four years after the end of the war on august 1 , the un-convention on cluster munitions came into effect .
israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .

in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .

" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .

no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .

the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 31.07.2010 cologne gears up to play and party as host to gay games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay games welcome men and women , gay or straight cologne is home to one of the largest and most active lesbian and gay communities in all of germany .
on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .

another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 31.07.2010 cologne gears up to play and party as host to gay games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay games welcome men and women , gay or straight cologne is home to one of the largest and most active lesbian and gay communities in all of germany .
on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

later , around 2,000 people gathered in a mourning processional to the site of the tragedy . demands for explanation were heard saturday among the words of mourning at memorials for the 21 victims killed at last week 's love parade stampede . " it is extremely important for those affected by the tragedy to experience that the whole nation is mourning with them , that millions are sympathizing , " german president christian wulff told 1live radio . wulff added , without naming names , that someone had to take responsibility for the tragedy and that there would be consequences for those responsible . earlier , hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , spoke before grieving family members and politicians about the young victims who " had their whole futures ahead of them . " " how could this happen ? " she asked at a memorial service in at duisburg 's salvator church .
" who is to bear the blame ?
who is responsible ? " " we owe it to them and no less to ourselves to get to the bottom of this inconceivable event , " said kraft , whose own son had attended the love parade . ' love stronger than death ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers took part in the church service kraft 's speech was preceded by religious words from nikolaus schneider , the leader of germany 's protestants , and franz-josef overbeck , the roman catholic bishop of essen . " our lives are so contradictory , " said overbeck .
" one moment it 's party , the next we lie helpless , on the ground . " overbeck recalled to mourners the name of the love parade , saying that love was stronger than death and would help them through their time of distress .
although the ecumenical christian service for the victims had space for only 550 mourners , video coverage was relayed to the city 's football stadium and 12 churches around the city to accommodate the thousands of people who came to show their respects . priority of place in the church was given to the relatives of the dead and seriously injured as well as members of the emergency services .
they were joined by kraft , as well as german chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff . around 2,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional from the city train station to the tunnel outside which the tragedy occurred , retracing the final steps of the deceased and releasing black and white balloons at the site of the stampede . bildunterschrift : merkel , wulff and kraft were among those attending question of responsibility one person absent from public view was adolf sauerland , duisburg 's mayor , who has come under intense pressure to resign amid growing anger at last saturday 's disaster . earlier in the week , kraft told the german regional daily rheinische post that sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . "
sauerland has maintained throughout the week that he did not sign any permit for the event to be held . the left party has placed a motion for sauerland to be removed from office at the next meeting of the duisburg city council , according to the rheinische post on friday . wilhelm bies , council group leader of the free democrats , told the newspaper that his party colleagues would support the removal of sauerland .
however , the next meeting is not until october . criticism of the mayor increased following the release of a preliminary investigative report on wednesday , which stated that love parade organizers had failed to adhere to their own safety plan and that the city government , which approved the event permit , had been disorganized . author : richard connor , david levitz -lrb- dpa / epd / reuters / kna -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .

getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 31.07.2010 the ever-present war in southern lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still there - even four years after the end of the war on august 1 , the un-convention on cluster munitions came into effect .
israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .

" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

later , around 2,000 people gathered in a mourning processional to the site of the tragedy . demands for explanation were heard saturday among the words of mourning at memorials for the 21 victims killed at last week 's love parade stampede . " it is extremely important for those affected by the tragedy to experience that the whole nation is mourning with them , that millions are sympathizing , " german president christian wulff told 1live radio . wulff added , without naming names , that someone had to take responsibility for the tragedy and that there would be consequences for those responsible . earlier , hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , spoke before grieving family members and politicians about the young victims who " had their whole futures ahead of them . " " how could this happen ? " she asked at a memorial service in at duisburg 's salvator church .
" who is to bear the blame ?
who is responsible ? " " we owe it to them and no less to ourselves to get to the bottom of this inconceivable event , " said kraft , whose own son had attended the love parade . ' love stronger than death ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers took part in the church service kraft 's speech was preceded by religious words from nikolaus schneider , the leader of germany 's protestants , and franz-josef overbeck , the roman catholic bishop of essen . " our lives are so contradictory , " said overbeck .
" one moment it 's party , the next we lie helpless , on the ground . " overbeck recalled to mourners the name of the love parade , saying that love was stronger than death and would help them through their time of distress .
although the ecumenical christian service for the victims had space for only 550 mourners , video coverage was relayed to the city 's football stadium and 12 churches around the city to accommodate the thousands of people who came to show their respects . priority of place in the church was given to the relatives of the dead and seriously injured as well as members of the emergency services .
they were joined by kraft , as well as german chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff . around 2,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional from the city train station to the tunnel outside which the tragedy occurred , retracing the final steps of the deceased and releasing black and white balloons at the site of the stampede . bildunterschrift : merkel , wulff and kraft were among those attending question of responsibility one person absent from public view was adolf sauerland , duisburg 's mayor , who has come under intense pressure to resign amid growing anger at last saturday 's disaster . earlier in the week , kraft told the german regional daily rheinische post that sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . "
sauerland has maintained throughout the week that he did not sign any permit for the event to be held . the left party has placed a motion for sauerland to be removed from office at the next meeting of the duisburg city council , according to the rheinische post on friday . wilhelm bies , council group leader of the free democrats , told the newspaper that his party colleagues would support the removal of sauerland .
however , the next meeting is not until october . criticism of the mayor increased following the release of a preliminary investigative report on wednesday , which stated that love parade organizers had failed to adhere to their own safety plan and that the city government , which approved the event permit , had been disorganized . author : richard connor , david levitz -lrb- dpa / epd / reuters / kna -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de poland -pipe- 31.07.2010 poland divided over plan to move kaczynski cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to remove the cross have sparked a heated debate the death of president lech kaczynski and many of poland 's political elite in a plane crash united a nation in grief in april .
now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

rights activists have condemned the police for brutalizing protestors . russian police arrested some 100 demonstrators saturday in moscow and st. petersburg as they violently dispersed opposition rallies in the two cities .
anti-kremlin opposition leader and former deputy prime minister boris nemtsov was taken into custody with dozens of other protestors who had gathered in moscow 's central victory square to exercise their right to freedom of assembly .
the democracy demonstration is regularly held on the 31st of the month in a bid to uphold the right to assemble , guaranteed by article 31 of the russian constitution .
authorities , however , had banned saturday 's protest , warning in advance that they would disband the event .
despite the warnings , a reported 500 gathered in moscow , chanting , " away with the police state , " " shame , police , " and " freedom ! "
many demonstrators also called for prime minister vladimir putin to step down .
" our goal is to get from the authorities respect of the article 31 of the constitution , " said alexander kurov , an activist with the other russia party in vladivostok .
protests intended to promote democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens were taken into police custody mikhail schneider , executive secretary of the solidarity movement , told the reuters news agency the protests were intended to promote democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .

the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .

a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

later , around 2,000 people gathered in a mourning processional to the site of the tragedy . demands for explanation were heard saturday among the words of mourning at memorials for the 21 victims killed at last week 's love parade stampede . " it is extremely important for those affected by the tragedy to experience that the whole nation is mourning with them , that millions are sympathizing , " german president christian wulff told 1live radio . wulff added , without naming names , that someone had to take responsibility for the tragedy and that there would be consequences for those responsible . earlier , hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , spoke before grieving family members and politicians about the young victims who " had their whole futures ahead of them . " " how could this happen ? " she asked at a memorial service in at duisburg 's salvator church .
" who is to bear the blame ?
who is responsible ? " " we owe it to them and no less to ourselves to get to the bottom of this inconceivable event , " said kraft , whose own son had attended the love parade . ' love stronger than death ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers took part in the church service kraft 's speech was preceded by religious words from nikolaus schneider , the leader of germany 's protestants , and franz-josef overbeck , the roman catholic bishop of essen . " our lives are so contradictory , " said overbeck .
" one moment it 's party , the next we lie helpless , on the ground . " overbeck recalled to mourners the name of the love parade , saying that love was stronger than death and would help them through their time of distress .
although the ecumenical christian service for the victims had space for only 550 mourners , video coverage was relayed to the city 's football stadium and 12 churches around the city to accommodate the thousands of people who came to show their respects . priority of place in the church was given to the relatives of the dead and seriously injured as well as members of the emergency services .
they were joined by kraft , as well as german chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff . around 2,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional from the city train station to the tunnel outside which the tragedy occurred , retracing the final steps of the deceased and releasing black and white balloons at the site of the stampede . bildunterschrift : merkel , wulff and kraft were among those attending question of responsibility one person absent from public view was adolf sauerland , duisburg 's mayor , who has come under intense pressure to resign amid growing anger at last saturday 's disaster . earlier in the week , kraft told the german regional daily rheinische post that sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . "
sauerland has maintained throughout the week that he did not sign any permit for the event to be held . the left party has placed a motion for sauerland to be removed from office at the next meeting of the duisburg city council , according to the rheinische post on friday . wilhelm bies , council group leader of the free democrats , told the newspaper that his party colleagues would support the removal of sauerland .
however , the next meeting is not until october . criticism of the mayor increased following the release of a preliminary investigative report on wednesday , which stated that love parade organizers had failed to adhere to their own safety plan and that the city government , which approved the event permit , had been disorganized . author : richard connor , david levitz -lrb- dpa / epd / reuters / kna -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de poland -pipe- 31.07.2010 poland divided over plan to move kaczynski cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to remove the cross have sparked a heated debate the death of president lech kaczynski and many of poland 's political elite in a plane crash united a nation in grief in april .
now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

despite the warnings , a reported 500 gathered in moscow , chanting , " away with the police state , " " shame , police , " and " freedom ! "
many demonstrators also called for prime minister vladimir putin to step down .

others had their heads beaten against police buses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .

' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .

rights activists have condemned the police for brutalizing protestors . russian police arrested some 100 demonstrators saturday in moscow and st. petersburg as they violently dispersed opposition rallies in the two cities .
anti-kremlin opposition leader and former deputy prime minister boris nemtsov was taken into custody with dozens of other protestors who had gathered in moscow 's central victory square to exercise their right to freedom of assembly .
the democracy demonstration is regularly held on the 31st of the month in a bid to uphold the right to assemble , guaranteed by article 31 of the russian constitution .
authorities , however , had banned saturday 's protest , warning in advance that they would disband the event .
despite the warnings , a reported 500 gathered in moscow , chanting , " away with the police state , " " shame , police , " and " freedom ! "
many demonstrators also called for prime minister vladimir putin to step down .
" our goal is to get from the authorities respect of the article 31 of the constitution , " said alexander kurov , an activist with the other russia party in vladivostok .
protests intended to promote democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens were taken into police custody mikhail schneider , executive secretary of the solidarity movement , told the reuters news agency the protests were intended to promote democracy .

the head of the leading russian human rights organization helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , condemned police brutality at the demonstration in moscow .
reuters reported , meanwhile , that several demonstrators in st. petersburg were seen with bloody noses .
others had their heads beaten against police buses .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 31.07.2010 the ever-present war in southern lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still there - even four years after the end of the war on august 1 , the un-convention on cluster munitions came into effect .
israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de poland -pipe- 31.07.2010 poland divided over plan to move kaczynski cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to remove the cross have sparked a heated debate the death of president lech kaczynski and many of poland 's political elite in a plane crash united a nation in grief in april .
now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?

" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 31.07.2010 the ever-present war in southern lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still there - even four years after the end of the war on august 1 , the un-convention on cluster munitions came into effect .
israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

" " how could this happen ? " she asked at a memorial service in at duisburg 's salvator church .

" our lives are so contradictory , " said overbeck .
" one moment it 's party , the next we lie helpless , on the ground . " overbeck recalled to mourners the name of the love parade , saying that love was stronger than death and would help them through their time of distress .
although the ecumenical christian service for the victims had space for only 550 mourners , video coverage was relayed to the city 's football stadium and 12 churches around the city to accommodate the thousands of people who came to show their respects . priority of place in the church was given to the relatives of the dead and seriously injured as well as members of the emergency services .
they were joined by kraft , as well as german chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff . around 2,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional from the city train station to the tunnel outside which the tragedy occurred , retracing the final steps of the deceased and releasing black and white balloons at the site of the stampede . bildunterschrift : merkel , wulff and kraft were among those attending question of responsibility one person absent from public view was adolf sauerland , duisburg 's mayor , who has come under intense pressure to resign amid growing anger at last saturday 's disaster . earlier in the week , kraft told the german regional daily rheinische post that sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . "
sauerland has maintained throughout the week that he did not sign any permit for the event to be held . the left party has placed a motion for sauerland to be removed from office at the next meeting of the duisburg city council , according to the rheinische post on friday . wilhelm bies , council group leader of the free democrats , told the newspaper that his party colleagues would support the removal of sauerland .
however , the next meeting is not until october . criticism of the mayor increased following the release of a preliminary investigative report on wednesday , which stated that love parade organizers had failed to adhere to their own safety plan and that the city government , which approved the event permit , had been disorganized . author : richard connor , david levitz -lrb- dpa / epd / reuters / kna -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who is responsible ? " " we owe it to them and no less to ourselves to get to the bottom of this inconceivable event , " said kraft , whose own son had attended the love parade . ' love stronger than death ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers took part in the church service kraft 's speech was preceded by religious words from nikolaus schneider , the leader of germany 's protestants , and franz-josef overbeck , the roman catholic bishop of essen . " our lives are so contradictory , " said overbeck .
" one moment it 's party , the next we lie helpless , on the ground . " overbeck recalled to mourners the name of the love parade , saying that love was stronger than death and would help them through their time of distress .
although the ecumenical christian service for the victims had space for only 550 mourners , video coverage was relayed to the city 's football stadium and 12 churches around the city to accommodate the thousands of people who came to show their respects . priority of place in the church was given to the relatives of the dead and seriously injured as well as members of the emergency services .
they were joined by kraft , as well as german chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff . around 2,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional from the city train station to the tunnel outside which the tragedy occurred , retracing the final steps of the deceased and releasing black and white balloons at the site of the stampede . bildunterschrift : merkel , wulff and kraft were among those attending question of responsibility one person absent from public view was adolf sauerland , duisburg 's mayor , who has come under intense pressure to resign amid growing anger at last saturday 's disaster . earlier in the week , kraft told the german regional daily rheinische post that sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . "
sauerland has maintained throughout the week that he did not sign any permit for the event to be held . the left party has placed a motion for sauerland to be removed from office at the next meeting of the duisburg city council , according to the rheinische post on friday . wilhelm bies , council group leader of the free democrats , told the newspaper that his party colleagues would support the removal of sauerland .
however , the next meeting is not until october . criticism of the mayor increased following the release of a preliminary investigative report on wednesday , which stated that love parade organizers had failed to adhere to their own safety plan and that the city government , which approved the event permit , had been disorganized . author : richard connor , david levitz -lrb- dpa / epd / reuters / kna -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.07.2010 leverkusen looks to ballack to lift and inspire last season 's title chokers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is back at the club where he excelled as a youth after suffering a cruel end to last season 's promising campaign , bayer levekusen 's young team looks to launch another title challenge .
the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .

rights activists have condemned the police for brutalizing protestors . russian police arrested some 100 demonstrators saturday in moscow and st. petersburg as they violently dispersed opposition rallies in the two cities .
anti-kremlin opposition leader and former deputy prime minister boris nemtsov was taken into custody with dozens of other protestors who had gathered in moscow 's central victory square to exercise their right to freedom of assembly .
the democracy demonstration is regularly held on the 31st of the month in a bid to uphold the right to assemble , guaranteed by article 31 of the russian constitution .
authorities , however , had banned saturday 's protest , warning in advance that they would disband the event .
despite the warnings , a reported 500 gathered in moscow , chanting , " away with the police state , " " shame , police , " and " freedom ! "
many demonstrators also called for prime minister vladimir putin to step down .
" our goal is to get from the authorities respect of the article 31 of the constitution , " said alexander kurov , an activist with the other russia party in vladivostok .
protests intended to promote democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens were taken into police custody mikhail schneider , executive secretary of the solidarity movement , told the reuters news agency the protests were intended to promote democracy .

reuters reported , meanwhile , that several demonstrators in st. petersburg were seen with bloody noses .
others had their heads beaten against police buses .

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .
since the official end of the war in august 2006 , 46 civilians have died because of cluster bombs while a further 340 have been injured .
according to estimates by the lebanese army , by 2014 southern lebanon should be cluster bomb-free - if there are no financial cuts to the minesweeping squad .
however it is very unlikely that they will be able to stick to the schedule .
international organizations report in unison that the number of donations is down on the past years .
they received a lot of money after the war says ali shuaib from mag international , an english-based ngo : " and then , bit by bit , it got less .
we used to have 400 employees , now it 's just 217 .
the less money we have , the slower the minesweeping continues . "

israel has not yet signed the agreement .
in the 2006 lebanon war israel is said to have dropped four million cluster bombs .
many failed to explode . finally nimr mustafa can return to his plantation .
for the first time in four years , this fall he will be able to harvest his olive trees : " there are 75 olive trees on my plantation .
but i have n't set foot on the land since 2006 . "
according to mustafa cluster bombs are spread all over the place .
the revenue from his harvest is an important extra income for mustafa , headmaster of the little local school : $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,145 euros -rrb- per season - money he could really do with . eventually a team of minesweepers from an international organization cleared the lot .
a risk he has to take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strenuous and nerve- wracking job : minesweepers have to search every meter nearby mustafa 's estate mohamed nasrallah lives in a modest cottage .
in his backyard there is a small plantation of fruits and olives .
he hardly enters it though , and when he does nasrallah is full of fear and trepidation .
" i have n't had the final cleanup .
there are still cluster bombs on my land , " the father of four says .
" but i have to go there , take care of the trees , water them and harvest the ripe fruits .
i ca n't let my trees die . "
his children , however , are not allowed to set foot on the plantation .
the courtyard and the surrounding streets have become their playground .
nasrallah and mustafa live in southern lebanon , in yohmor , a small village a couple of kilometers east of nabatieh .
a few steps from the village , the al litani river flows through a steep canyon .
no one would guess that only four years ago this idyllic place of 2,000 souls was the site of acrimonious battles and struggles .
during the war between israel and lebanon in 2006 , this area was among the most hard-fought over regions and there are still traces of shell splinters on some walls or in a few side streets .
but all the houses have been rebuilt , most streets have been freshly tarmaced .
pictures of young soldiers who were killed in action are put up on power poles , right next to the hezbollah logo , with its green letters on yellow background .
the posters have been hanging there for a while and have been bleached by the sun .
it seems like time has stood still .
death lurks everywhere and the war still lingers on in yohmor .
cluster bombs still contaminate roughly 80 percent of the farm land and the forests .
the bombs lurk underground , in between rocks , in waste pipes , on trees or in dry stone walls .
they are everywhere , spread all over the place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red circles signify a controlled explosion the israeli army used munitions that were 35 years old , says mohamed scheikh from the center for minesweeping with the lebanese army .
" therefore the number of duds is very high .
in some areas it 's 100 percent - none of the discharged bombs exploded right away , " he explains .
" 43.6 square kilometers -lrb- 16.8 square miles -rrb- in southern lebanon were affected .
so far , we 've managed to clean up half of it already . "
cluster bombs are malicious weapons .
they do not have a due date : " they are always ready to explode .
and the longer they remain underground , the more sensitive and dangerous they get .
due to heavy rain and torrents they change their position , " he says .
no end in sight yet farmers and shepherds are among the high-risk groups .
they know how dangerous duds are - but like mohamed nasrallah they are frequently forced to farm their fields or set foot on meadows that are only superficially cleaned up .
many people in the southern part of lebanon depend on farming and cattle breeding .
many received compensation and donations for the reconstruction of war-torn buildings - but there is no money for damages or the loss of earnings caused by cluster bombs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de italy -pipe- 31.07.2010 berlusconi 's tempestuousness backfires as fini maintains allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has seen disappearing allies and dropping approval ratings italy may be facing early elections following a dramatic falling out between prime minister silvio berlusconi and a powerful political ally .
berlusconi has rejected speculation that his government is at risk of collapse . gianfranco fini , the speaker of italy 's lower house of parliament , appears to have come out on top after prime minister silvio berlusconi broke ties between the two earlier this week .
" the numbers seem to argue for fini and against berlusconi , " said angelo panebianco of the leading italian daily corriere della sera , after 33 lawmakers deserted the prime minister friday to support fini .
following berlusconi 's attempt earlier in the week to oust fini from the ruling people of liberty -lrb- pdl -rrb- party the two co-founded in 2008 , fini formed his own faction in the lower house , dubbed future and freedom for italy .
as berlusconi sheds allies and his approval ratings drop , critics say he will no longer enjoy the margin of error he once did - nor be able to call a vote of confidence when it suits him , as he has recently done with increasing frequency .
' destructive criticism ' late on thursday , berlusconi 's people of liberty party moved to censure gianfranco fini , the party 's co-founder , accusing him of " destructive criticism " and asking for his resignation as speaker of the lower house of parliament .
the prime minister labeled fini as a traitor and conspirator , and accused him of trying to bring about a " slow death " to their party .
" the positions of mr. fini are absolutely incompatible with the founding principles of the people of liberty party , " said berlusconi in a televised press conference .
" it breaks my heart but i do n't think we can carry on like this . "
fini refused to resign and approved the formation of a new political bloc in both houses of parliament made up of his allies , theoretically giving him significant clout in key votes .
' there is no risk , ' says berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi , right , and fini co-founded the people of liberty party in 2008 despite media reports describing berlusconi 's two-year-old government as being on the " brink of crisis , " the prime minister has insisted that fini 's departure will have no detrimental effect .
" there is no risk , " berlusconi said .
" we have a majority . "
berlusconi on friday reportedly told his aides that if there were enough defectors and " if they make our lives difficult , " he would indeed call an early election before his term ends in 2013 , secure in his belief that his party will succeed without fini .
trouble brewing for months the rift between berlusconi and fini , once considered his heir as leader of the center-right party , had been developing since last year .
in recent months , however , tensions had escalated .
fini had criticized the morality and legality of berlusconi 's government , clashing with him on immigration policy , the response to corruption probes against ministers and an immunity law for politicians .
he also criticized the prime minster for not allowing dissent within the party .
italian daily corriere della sera said the break-up would be " insidious for the entire -lsb- political -rsb- system " and have long-lasting effects on the unity of the center-right .
berlusconi has left it up to parliamentarians to decide for themselves whether fini should remain as speaker of the lower house .
if the political situation deteriorates further , president giorgio napolitano has the option of appointing an interim government until new elections can be held .

the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?
ballack to add bite and belief to disappointed leverkusen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's return can help his new team get over last season the most obvious move heynckes and sporting director rudi voeller have made to ensure there is heart and bite in a team which looked weak and toothless is to add michael ballack to its ranks .
getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .
in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .

getting a midfielder of ballack 's experience and standing on a free transfer from chelsea has been something of a coup for leverkusen , the club where he spent three seasons between 1999 and 2002 .

ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .

in the time he 's been away , ballack has collected three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup with bayern munich as well as one premiership title and three fa cups in england .
he 's also increased his level of champions league participation , although the coveted trophy continues to elude him .
ballack has put his reputation as the eternal runner-up behind him and become a winner , both literally and mentally .
ballack also knows what it feels like to be in a championship-chasing bayer leverkusen team and how it feels to lose that race .
he will know exactly how the team around him will be feeling when leverkusen start the coming campaign in earnest .
all this experience will be hugely valuable .
leverkusen need to come out fighting this season , not timidly take to the field with bruises and wounds from the previous fight still unhealed .
ballack has tasted his fair share of bitter disappointment and wo n't stand for anyone wallowing in the past .
he is the ideal player to pick this team up and set them on their way again with belief .
heynckes and voeller will be hoping that ballack is hurting , to a certain extent , after missing out on the world cup and facing a battle to regain the captaincy of the national team .
wounded pride has always been a strong motivator for the man from chemnitz and leverkusen will also benefit if ballack pulls on the shirt every week believing he has something to prove .
those players around him will need to feel that desire too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfield loses toni kroos to bayern munich more in than out as heynckes boosts young team leverkusen will need ballack 's authority in a midfield shorn of the talents of youngster toni kroos , who has moved back to bayern munich from where he was on loan .
another returning leverkusen player and former ballack teammate , hanno balitsch , will give the team further midfield options after switching from hanover as will the 21-year-old marcel risse , a summer signing from nuremberg .
another 21-year-old , croatian midfielder domagoj vida , joins from nk osijek while sidney sam from kaiserslautern has been signed to boost leverkusen 's attacking options .
the leverkusen fans will be glad that , so far , their club has been investing more than offloading .
as well as kroos , leverkusen have only sold on the experienced polish midfielder tomasz zdebel to alemannia aachen while defender lukas sinkiewicz has moved to augsburg .
it will mostly be the team that ran the championship race from october to march last time and which will be hoping to stay the course to the end of this season .

the club hopes michael ballack can inspire the team to forget its disappointment . if only last season could have ended at christmas .
bayer leverkusen would not have just been celebrating a 3-2 victory over borussia moenchengladbach but they would have been lifting the championship shield in front of their own fans after being crowned worthy winners of the bundesliga .
they would have been undefeated champions , pipping second-placed schalke to the title by a point .
leverkusen fans do n't need to be reminded of what happened after the winter break , how the dream of their first ever title lasted a mere six weeks into 2010 before a goalless draw at home to cologne , followed by a 3-2 away defeat to nuremberg , starting the descent to fourth where they finished the season proper in may .
leverkusen painfully ran out of steam in a title race they led from the eighth week to the 23rd .
a team predominantly built around a host of talented youngsters with a few old heads thrown in for experience , leverkusen used that youthful exuberance to propel them to the top of the league and keep them there for almost half of the season .
often they reached sublime heights for such a young team , and often showed steel to avoid defeat in tricky circumstances .
but it was n't to last .
the defeat to nuremberg in march , their first in the league , knocked the belief out of them .
the four defeats and three draws that followed told a story of a team running on empty , mentally and physically .
even experienced players like sami hyypiae , manuel friedrich and hans sarpei could n't find the inspiration to push leverkusen 's youngsters into the final , desperate push as their title hopes faded .
once more they finished the season empty-handed .
bayer never-kusen had blown it again .
so what is coach jupp heynckes doing to make sure that any assault on the summit this season does n't end up running out of oxygen and slipping back down to base camp ?

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .
the comparison to the olympics is common , but kelly stevens , officer of communications for the parent group federation of gay games , said there are many important differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diving is one of the most popular events " we really do allow all levels of participation , " he told reporters at a press conference in cologne on friday .
" we categorize it by age or by level , and this allows beginners and really , really good athletes to participate against each other .
and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .
matthew mitcham , an openly gay olympic-gold medalist in diving from australia , said many young gays and lesbians might feel like there is no place for them in the sporting world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about more than competition " there are a lot of sports that have this macho mentality , and a lot of gay and lesbian people might not feel comfortable in that kind of environment , " he said .
" i think the gay games is a great way for people to actually participate in sport where they might not normally have felt comfortable enough . "
john amaechi , a retired professional basketball player for the american nba and official ambassador for this year 's games , added that the assumption that gays and lesbians are not excluded from sports is entirely false .
" you look at the olympics , that 's an organization that we 're supposed to believe is all about spreading peace and love , " he said .
" but we will have this coming olympics in london , teams that are sent from countries that will have no women in them .
so sport is not equal . "
not just for the athletes while the gay games are primarily an event for the athletes , kelly stevens said some of the people who are most changed by participating in the events are actually the officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheerleaders have been practicing hard " for many of them , it will be the first time they officiate an all-gay , lesbian sport event , " he said .
" and they gain respect for all of the athletes and participants .
and maybe the next time they 're officiating their own game in their own town and there 's some sort of taunting or homophobic statement , they might be inclined to care . "
the gay games opening ceremony takes place saturday evening in cologne , with performances by musical artists agnes and taylor dayne .
the games run until august 7 .

on saturday , the city played host to thousands of visitors from around the world as the gay games opened in the city . the eighth quadrennial gay games kicked off in cologne on saturday with an opening ceremony attended by openly-gay german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
as patron of the games , westerwelle gave the opening speech .
" we do not ask for privilege , we ask for respect , " he said during a ceremony that culminated in the olympic-style lighting of the gay games flame .
the games are a week-long celebration with 35 different sporting events , ranging from track and field and swimming to chess and bridge .
the event is expected to draw some 10,000 participants this year , from more than 70 different countries .

and i think that makes us very different . "
stevens added that all people are welcome to participate in the games , and that many of the athletes and organizers are straight .
a place for inclusion a common question people associated with the gay games often have to answer is why gay and lesbian athletes need their own , separate event when they are not specifically excluded from the olympics , or other sporting events .

later , around 2,000 people gathered in a mourning processional to the site of the tragedy . demands for explanation were heard saturday among the words of mourning at memorials for the 21 victims killed at last week 's love parade stampede . " it is extremely important for those affected by the tragedy to experience that the whole nation is mourning with them , that millions are sympathizing , " german president christian wulff told 1live radio . wulff added , without naming names , that someone had to take responsibility for the tragedy and that there would be consequences for those responsible . earlier , hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , spoke before grieving family members and politicians about the young victims who " had their whole futures ahead of them . " " how could this happen ? " she asked at a memorial service in at duisburg 's salvator church .
" who is to bear the blame ?
who is responsible ? " " we owe it to them and no less to ourselves to get to the bottom of this inconceivable event , " said kraft , whose own son had attended the love parade . ' love stronger than death ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers took part in the church service kraft 's speech was preceded by religious words from nikolaus schneider , the leader of germany 's protestants , and franz-josef overbeck , the roman catholic bishop of essen . " our lives are so contradictory , " said overbeck .
" one moment it 's party , the next we lie helpless , on the ground . " overbeck recalled to mourners the name of the love parade , saying that love was stronger than death and would help them through their time of distress .
although the ecumenical christian service for the victims had space for only 550 mourners , video coverage was relayed to the city 's football stadium and 12 churches around the city to accommodate the thousands of people who came to show their respects . priority of place in the church was given to the relatives of the dead and seriously injured as well as members of the emergency services .
they were joined by kraft , as well as german chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff . around 2,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional from the city train station to the tunnel outside which the tragedy occurred , retracing the final steps of the deceased and releasing black and white balloons at the site of the stampede . bildunterschrift : merkel , wulff and kraft were among those attending question of responsibility one person absent from public view was adolf sauerland , duisburg 's mayor , who has come under intense pressure to resign amid growing anger at last saturday 's disaster . earlier in the week , kraft told the german regional daily rheinische post that sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . "
sauerland has maintained throughout the week that he did not sign any permit for the event to be held . the left party has placed a motion for sauerland to be removed from office at the next meeting of the duisburg city council , according to the rheinische post on friday . wilhelm bies , council group leader of the free democrats , told the newspaper that his party colleagues would support the removal of sauerland .
however , the next meeting is not until october . criticism of the mayor increased following the release of a preliminary investigative report on wednesday , which stated that love parade organizers had failed to adhere to their own safety plan and that the city government , which approved the event permit , had been disorganized . author : richard connor , david levitz -lrb- dpa / epd / reuters / kna -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de poland -pipe- 31.07.2010 poland divided over plan to move kaczynski cross großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to remove the cross have sparked a heated debate the death of president lech kaczynski and many of poland 's political elite in a plane crash united a nation in grief in april .
now , plans to move a memorial to the tragedy reveal polish society 's true fault lines . protesters loyal to the poland 's late president lech kaczynski are picketing warsaw 's presidential palace over plans by the new administration to move a cross dedicated to their political hero .
nationalist and roman catholic protesters are demanding that the cross remain at the palace instead of being moved to a religious location .
poland 's president elect bronislaw komorowski , who is to take office in august , wants the wooden cross moved first to a church in warsaw 's historic old town before going on to a shrine in southern poland .
the presidential palace has agreed on the course of action along with the roman catholic warsaw diocese and a scout group that erected the cross soon after the air tragedy in april .
kaczynski and his wife maria were killed in an air crash in russia last april along with 94 others - including much of the country 's political elite .
in the months after the president 's death , the cross became a shrine for those who valued kaczynski 's patriotism and roman catholic values .
it has been adorned with floral tributes and candles by visitors from across the country .
disregarding poland 's tradition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of bronislaw komorowski as president marks a change of direction opponents to its removal include the late president 's identical twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the snap presidential elections earlier in july .
" if president komorowski does get rid of the cross then we 'll all be able to see him in his true colors , " said kaczynski .
" he has already demonstrated his disregard for poland 's historical tradition . "
" the cross is a symbol not just of the late president but also of all the victims of the air disaster in which they lost their lives .
not until a monument is erected to honor them will it be possible to move the cross , " kaczynski said .
the row over the cross has also highlighted divisions between roman catholic groups and secularists , who felt kaczynski was too close to the church .
critics of kaczynski also say that his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course , straining relations with the european union .
komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski is likely using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's policies were not universally liked divide within church the church also appears split on the issue .
meddling with the affairs of state could have far-reaching implications for the church , according to zbigniew nosowski , editor of the liberal religious magazine wiez .
" polish bishops are divided .
there are some bishops who support this type of thinking , they like this political stance , and others who are publicly critical .
but since they have n't reached a common opinion , no move was made , " he said .
" the biggest danger is that young people may identify the church 's message with a closed way of thinking , which is a kind of besieged fortress .
if problems last for too long and are not solved , the price has to be paid for it .
and this price can be speeding secularization in poland . "
meanwhile , polish authorities have agreed to place a plaque in front of the presidential palace to honor all the 96 victims of the air disaster .
