but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .

" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .
the newspaper reported that many of the accounts were with swiss lenders ubs and credit suisse. dfm / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .
" we think all parties have shown their political will to fulfill this exchange , " he said , without naming specific countries. bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .
the newspaper reported that many of the accounts were with swiss lenders ubs and credit suisse. dfm / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must mobilize all our levers of influence - political , economic , plus civil and military crisis management tools - in support of a single political strategy . "
ashton made the comments at the munich security conference , a a gathering of the world 's top defense officials .
" the days when a common eu foreign policy was regarded as mere talk are numbered , " she said at the munich security conference on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton says the eu must combine all its levers of influence ashton 's post as eu foreign minister was created in december 2009 by the lisbon reform treaty to give the bloc a more coherent international voice .
ashton said the lisbon treaty signalled a " significant change of pace . "
international credibility ashton said the eu should break down the traditional separation between for instance peacekeeping and development work or domestic and foreign police .
" there can not be sustainable development without peace and security .
and without development and poverty eradication there will be no sustainable peace , " she said .
ashton called for the eu to continue its focus on southern and eastern europe to further stabilize the balkans but also include former soviet neighbors such as ukraine and georgia .
" we know that we in the eu have primary responsibility for our neighbourhood .
this is important in itself but our wider international credibility also depends on the work we do with our neighbours , " she said .
at the same time , ashton urged for " strengthening partnerships with what we somewhat misleadingly call the ' new powers ' : china , india , south africa , brazil , mexico and indonesia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle too wants the eu to live up to its role as ' global player ' westerwelle backs european army germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle in munich also called for the eu to " live up to its role as global player . "
" the long-term goal is the establishment of a european army under full parliamentary control .
the eu must be able to respond quickly , flexibly and to take a united stand , " westerwelle said .
" we want strong european crisis management .
this is not intended to replace other security structures .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .
the newspaper reported that many of the accounts were with swiss lenders ubs and credit suisse. dfm / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.02.2010 latvians worried about decision to accept gitmo inmate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants european nations to take detainees from the guantanamo camp the latvian government says its decision to accept a detainee from the guantanamo military prison camp is prompted by its close ties to the us .
but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .
" we think all parties have shown their political will to fulfill this exchange , " he said , without naming specific countries. bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .

mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .
the newspaper reported that many of the accounts were with swiss lenders ubs and credit suisse. dfm / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann says the bank is well positioned for 2010 " i can not imagine that we will pay the same compensation level going forward if the other things are changing so drastically , " ackermann said , citing the regulatory overhaul expected in the global financial industry .
" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .
" in our business in asia , we intend to become one of the top three investment banks , " ackermann said. dc / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's consumer protection minister has warned of a ' millionfold violation of privacy rights . ' germany has warned internet giant google that it might take legal action to prevent google street view from offering photos on the country 's cities and streets .
the country 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner told focus magazine that she was considering " legal steps and possible changes to the law , " to prevent google from publishing photos taken in germany .
google 's street view offers 360-degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
the service is already available for the us , britain , france and other countries .
aigner said she was considering reversing a 2009 settlement whereby individuals would have to object should they not want to have their house or property photographed .
rather , aigner suggested , it should be google who has to seek permission from individuals to put their data online .
bildunterschrift : google street view is already available for the us and several european countries .
seen here is an image of paris ' charles de gaulle square ' a millionfold violation of privacy ' the minister described the images on google street view as " a millionfold violation of privacy rights . "
" no secret service in the world would hunt for images in such a cavalier manner , " aigner said .
google rejects the criticism , saying that it had been granted the permission to take the pictures under the 2009 settlement with the german authorities .
the deal included a provision that licence plates and faces would be blurred and that any individual could object to the their photographs appearing online .
google says only some hundred people so far had objected .

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .

" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .

google rejects the criticism , saying that it had been granted the permission to take the pictures under the 2009 settlement with the german authorities .
the deal included a provision that licence plates and faces would be blurred and that any individual could object to the their photographs appearing online .
google says only some hundred people so far had objected .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .
the newspaper reported that many of the accounts were with swiss lenders ubs and credit suisse. dfm / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .

this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "

although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .
" we think all parties have shown their political will to fulfill this exchange , " he said , without naming specific countries. bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .

the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .
the newspaper reported that many of the accounts were with swiss lenders ubs and credit suisse. dfm / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann says the bank is well positioned for 2010 " i can not imagine that we will pay the same compensation level going forward if the other things are changing so drastically , " ackermann said , citing the regulatory overhaul expected in the global financial industry .
" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .
" in our business in asia , we intend to become one of the top three investment banks , " ackermann said. dc / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 06.02.2010 germany steps up hunt for tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to pay 2.5 million euros for the swiss bank data german tax investigators are reportedly in france for negotiations with an informant to buy stolen swiss bank data on 1,500 alleged tax evaders .
the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .

" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.02.2010 latvians worried about decision to accept gitmo inmate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants european nations to take detainees from the guantanamo camp the latvian government says its decision to accept a detainee from the guantanamo military prison camp is prompted by its close ties to the us .
but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

" we know that we in the eu have primary responsibility for our neighbourhood .
this is important in itself but our wider international credibility also depends on the work we do with our neighbours , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.02.2010 latvians worried about decision to accept gitmo inmate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants european nations to take detainees from the guantanamo camp the latvian government says its decision to accept a detainee from the guantanamo military prison camp is prompted by its close ties to the us .
but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .

" we must mobilize all our levers of influence - political , economic , plus civil and military crisis management tools - in support of a single political strategy . "
ashton made the comments at the munich security conference , a a gathering of the world 's top defense officials .

international credibility ashton said the eu should break down the traditional separation between for instance peacekeeping and development work or domestic and foreign police .
" there can not be sustainable development without peace and security .
and without development and poverty eradication there will be no sustainable peace , " she said .
ashton called for the eu to continue its focus on southern and eastern europe to further stabilize the balkans but also include former soviet neighbors such as ukraine and georgia .
" we know that we in the eu have primary responsibility for our neighbourhood .
this is important in itself but our wider international credibility also depends on the work we do with our neighbours , " she said .
at the same time , ashton urged for " strengthening partnerships with what we somewhat misleadingly call the ' new powers ' : china , india , south africa , brazil , mexico and indonesia . "

the eu must be able to respond quickly , flexibly and to take a united stand , " westerwelle said .
" we want strong european crisis management .
this is not intended to replace other security structures .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .
" we think all parties have shown their political will to fulfill this exchange , " he said , without naming specific countries. bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann says the bank is well positioned for 2010 " i can not imagine that we will pay the same compensation level going forward if the other things are changing so drastically , " ackermann said , citing the regulatory overhaul expected in the global financial industry .
" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann says the bank is well positioned for 2010 " i can not imagine that we will pay the same compensation level going forward if the other things are changing so drastically , " ackermann said , citing the regulatory overhaul expected in the global financial industry .
" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .
" in our business in asia , we intend to become one of the top three investment banks , " ackermann said. dc / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .
pay to decrease , deutsche boss says during the conference call , ackermann also said that he expects bankers ' pay levels to decrease in years to come as banks lower the amount of bonus payments for their staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann says the bank is well positioned for 2010 " i can not imagine that we will pay the same compensation level going forward if the other things are changing so drastically , " ackermann said , citing the regulatory overhaul expected in the global financial industry .
" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .
in the final three months of last year , deutsche bank turned in profits of 1.3 billion euros , a statement said .
the results were bolstered by a tax benefit of 554 million euros .
analysts also reported concerns about a fall-off in earnings at the investment banking division in the final part of the year .
in 2010 , the bank aims to boost its presence in key emerging economies in asia , central and eastern europe , as well as the middle east .
" in our business in asia , we intend to become one of the top three investment banks , " ackermann said. dc / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .
a ban , however , she said was not justified .
disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .
the party could " continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people , schoolchildren and first-time voters " , npd member claus cremer said .
according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .
police in the state of lower saxony had requested for the cd to be banned arguing that it contains elements of nazi ideology .
the interior ministry of lower saxony reacted with disappointment to the decision .
" we find it strange that the cd has not been classified as dangerous to youth , " a ministry spokesman said .
the office for the protection of the constitution said that " independent of this decision we still regard the cd as dangerous . "
the material conveyed an anti-foreigner agenda , a spokeswoman said .
" we therefore will continue to work with schools to raise this issue with both teachers and parents . "
the npd , which has an overtly anti-immigration program , is under official observation by the german office for the protection of the constitution which describes the party as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist .
although the party has no seats in the federal parliament , it is represented in two of 16 german state legislatures . attempts to ban the party have failed in the past. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he expects industry pay to decline in coming years . deutsche bank - germany 's largest bank - was the first institution to reveal what it expects to pay in the uk " supertax " on bonuses .
ackermann said the bank will spread the tax burden across its global operations to avoid the bank 's key operations in london being " destroyed " if its 8,000 staff there were not adequately compensated .
" we are in a very sensitive situation right now and want to find the right optimization , " ackermann said in a conference call with analysts .
" we could not pay no bonus without jeopardizing the franchise . "
the 50 percent tax covers all bonus payments above the first 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .
deutsche bank 's payment is an indication that the tax could raise some 2 billion pounds to fill britain 's coffers , based on estimates from analysts of some 75,000 people working in london 's investment banking sector .

" the more we see capital , the more we see incremental taxation , the more likely and the more necessary it is , also for the benefit of shareholders , that we do something on the compensation level , " he said .
he said that deutsche bank is increasing employees ' fixed pay by 5 percent to 30 percent , in turn reducing bonus payments by an equal amount .
the bank may also claw back bonus payments in the event of losses .
2009 results posted alongside news of the uk bonus tax , deutsche bank also reported a rebound in the final quarter of 2009 , with an annual net profit of 5 billion euros following a loss of 3.9 billion euros in 2008 .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .

she said there had to be a balance between protecting teenagers and respecting the right to freedom of speech .
" political content alone is not enough to warrant a ban , " she said , adding that the cd did not contain calls for violence .
monssen-engberding however suggested that schools should nonetheless try to prevent the material from being distributed to students .

disappointment over decision the npd , germany 's leading far-right party , has welcomed the decision on their website .

according to monssen-engberding 's office , the npd has been distributing free cds with songs and interviews by party members outside schools since 2004 .

the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats . german magazine focus reported on saturday that tax authorities would acquire the controversial data on the weekend in france .
quoting sources close to the investigation , the munich-based magazine said the unnamed informant had insisted on a secret meeting in a neighboring country for fear of being arrested in germany .
germany is to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- for the stolen data on 1,500 german clients of a swiss bank .
reports say the data could potentially yield at least 400 million euros in tax revenues .
the decision to buy the illegally-obtained information has divided the german government and strained relations with switzerland .
on saturday , germany 's finance minister wolfgang schaueble said switzerland 's fabled banking secrecy laws were outdated and needed to be dismantled .
" bank secrecy can not be an instrument in the 21st century used to evade taxes , " schaueble told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" there 's no future for bank secrecy .
it 's finished .
its time has run out . "
the decision by germany to pay for the stolen data has sparked anger in switzerland .
politicians in the country say berlin 's willingness to buy stolen data raises worrying ethical questions .
two more german states offered data meanwhile , a new set of data with details of alleged tax evaders has reportedly been offered to german authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and the southern state of bavaria .
on friday , bertram dornheim , a spokesman for the state 's finance ministry , which was contacted by the informant offering the new data , could not confirm how many swiss accounts were involved , nor whether the informant had asked for a fee for the information .
but he did say that the informant had supplied authorities with samples of data on potential tax cheats last year and had now " supplied additional , substantial quantities of data . "
he added that the " potentially very interesting " information was currently being examined .
the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the new disk contained information on around 2,000 german investors holding accounts in switzerland .
the newspaper reported that many of the accounts were with swiss lenders ubs and credit suisse. dfm / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i personally believe we have created conducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future , " iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told the annual munich security conference on friday , january 5 .
such a deal could represent a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program , but it was not clear whether iran 's conditions would be acceptable to the united states and others .
mottaki said it should be up to tehran to set the amounts to be exchanged , based on its needs .
the uranium swap deal was first discussed last year between iran and six world powers , which saw it as a way to ensure tehran did not further enrich its uranium to a level that would be potentially usable in a nuclear bomb .
but tehran , which denies any bomb-making intentions , had failed to respond positively to the proposal from the group - the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -until this week .
mottaki said he would discuss the exchange on saturday with the new head of the international atomic energy agency , yukiya amano , on the fringes of the munich conference .
" we think all parties have shown their political will to fulfill this exchange , " he said , without naming specific countries. bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the move has sparked concerns among the baltic country 's citizens . us president barack obama has requested europe to accept detainees in his bid to close the widely criticized jail in cuba set up by his predecessor , george w. bush , to house suspected militants captured abroad . latvia is among several european nations - including france , hungary , ireland , italy , portugal , slovakia and spain - that in recent months have responded to obama 's request . latvia initially considered taking in three former inmates but reduced its offer to one .
the man , described as a former detainee , is reportedly an uzbek who spent five years at guantanamo after being detained in afghanistan .
latvia 's foreign ministry said earlier this week the man would arrive within the next six months .
at guantanamo , us authorities had categorized him as someone who did not pose a threat to the public , the ministry said , and therefore ' cleared ' him for release .
he would be considered for refugee status and provided with an apartment and a monthly allowance .
a close us ally latvia is a close us ally .
the country 's government says its decision was prompted at least in part as a gesture of thanks to the us which helped latvia regain its independence from russia in the early 1990s and become a nato member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to accept a gitmo inmate has sparked concern in latvia " this is the case -lrb- where -rrb- the us government has asked a number of european countries to assist them .
and , on the basis of our good relations , i think this is a matter of decision made between two very close partners , " latvian foreign affairs minister maris riekstins said .
" and , if we look at our recent history of last two decades there were number of concrete cases when we have felt strong assistance and support from us administration .
this is a way how we are reciprocating that support we have felt in previous years . "
misgivings among latvians but not everyone shares that view .
although the latvian security services will be closely monitoring the newcomer , some local citizens are concerned .
one woman interviewed by deutsche welle asked : " why ca n't he go back to asia ?
that 's where he comes from .
why should he come here ?
i do n't understand this decision ! "
another woman said " this could endanger the citizens of latvia .
i do n't believe that our authorities will manage to supervise him all of the time . "
another respondent told deutsche welle latvia had come under diplomatic pressure .
" i do n't think we had any other options .
big brother asked us to do this .
but it 's certainly not good . "
in fact , recent opinion polls show that one in three latvians is concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's foreign minister maris riekstins says the move is a gesture of thanks to the us zaneta ozolina , a professor of international affairs at the university of latvia said while international terrorism is high on the global news agenda latvia 's population always thought that terrorism was somewhere far outside their country .
" we have to be cautious , but we do n't have to be afraid .
so i think this guantanamo detainee case probably changes .. if i can say ... -lrb- the -rrb- different grades now of fear and feelings about terrorism .
it became closer , " ozolina told deutsche welle .
official rebuffs terrorism fears but the latvian government insists that the detainee will not pose any terrorist threats to the country .
the former latvian ambassador to the united states ojars kalnins said the move is a humanitarian gesture and is meant to demonstrate to its allies that latvia is a reliable partner .
" we are responding to a particular request .
i would hope that there would n't be future cases like this , " kalnins said .
" but i think latvia indicated with this that we can be relied on to provide help in the form that we are able to offer it – whether it 's the us , whether it 's europe .
and , i think here we just demonstrated that we 're open , we 're willing , and can contribute something to collective security , " he said .
