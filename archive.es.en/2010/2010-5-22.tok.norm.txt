" we 're delighted we 've reached agreement on a contract extension with one of the world 's best players , " rummenigge told the bundesliga club 's website .

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .

the news came as the irish airline announced plans for fresh investment in germany . germany 's federal court of justice ruled on thursday that ryanair put customers at a disadvantage by charging them a fee for using a credit or debit card to pay for tickets .
by charging the fee , the airline was thrusting on customers the costs of fulfilling its own legal obligations , the court , based in the southwestern town of karlsruhe , said .
germany 's leading consumer organization brought the case against the irish budget airline for charging a fee of between 1.50 and 4 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 - $ 5 -rrb- per passenger , saying ryanair did not offer consumers any way to pay for flights without paying an additional fee .
however , no fee was charged for paying with a visa electron card , a sister card to the visa debit card .
ryanair had argued that it was simply passing on to consumers the fee banks charge for credit card payments .
ryanair to create new jobs the court ruling came as ryanair announced plans to build a 25-million-euro crew training facility and maintenance hangar at frankfurt 's hahn airport .
the airline said the fresh investment would create up to 200 new jobs in the country .

he said the company was planning to rent a large maintenance hall that the airport will arrange for an investor to build at a cost of about 8 million euros .
o 'leary said construction work was due to begin in july .
starting in december , a major part of ryanair 's fleet would be serviced at hahn , he added .
about 1.5 million euros would be invested in a training center , located in an existing building , and the new facility would be in use as soon as august .
o 'leary added that ryanair intended to boost the number of planes it has based at hahn from 11 to 16 over the next five years , creating 350 new jobs .
the number of passengers was expected to rise from four million to six million a year .
hendrik hering , transport minister of the state of rhineland palatinate , where the airport is situated , said he was pleased with the decision .
he said the airline 's expansion plans were likely to attract other investors because it was now clear that ryanair intended to stay at hahn airport. rb / apb / dpa editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 22.05.2010 divisions emerge in german government over transaction tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners generally oppose new taxes days after the german center-right coalition government presented a unified front on a new tax on the financial sector , parliamentary and cabinet leaders have made skeptical statements over its feasibility . disagreements in the german government over a financial transaction tax resurfaced as the finance minister made statements saying that a global tax would likely be rejected by the united states .
" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .
" i ask that we consider what has a chance internationally , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief steinmeier said the transaction tax was essential opposition dissent perhaps the strongest support for the transaction tax has come from the opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who abstained from a vote on a eurozone bailout fund on friday largely because merkel 's government has not sufficiently supported the tax .
party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .
" we need this revenue to invest in the future and to secure our social welfare state , " he told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the highly-anticipated restructuring plan of general motors ' european unit is designed to qualify the company for state guarantees from the german government .
workers at opel agreed to a series of cuts that would amount to 265 million euros -lrb- $ 333 million -rrb- per year through 2014 .
the bulk of the money will come from salary freezes , reduced bonuses and holiday pay , and some layoffs that will eliminate just over 8,000 of opel 's 50,000-member workforce in europe .
about half of those cuts would come at the german factory in russelsheim , where most european opel employees work .
for their part in the restructuring plan , opel employees have been promised shares of profits and protection against further job cuts .
general motors hopes the cuts will satisfy requirements put forth by the german government for state aid. mz / dpa / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the semifinal match began like a fairy tale , however , with germany 's marcel goc scoring the go-ahead goal in the 16th minute .
the puck took a lucky bounce in a scramble in front of the russian net and goc chipped it past goalie vasili koshechkin .
russia stuck to its game plan and launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal with a team of international stars that read like the who 's who of ice hockey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany put up a great fight against the russians but it took until 12 minutes into the second period before one of them , yevgeni malkin , put away a blistering slapshot that was so fast the cameras could n't even see it .
with the score tied at one all , the teams returned to their dressing rooms for the second break with the russians wondering how they were ever going to win this match against a german team that knew it had to play the game of its life to win - and did its best to do just that .
the germans - and the russians - had oodles of scoring opportunities , but good defense and great goaltending on both sides pushed the sold-out crowd of 18,734 german and russian fans in the cologne arena to the brink of a communal nervous breakdown .
german coach uwe krupp called it one of the best games his team had ever played .
" we had chances to score a second and third goal .
but the russians scored instead .
that was the difference , " he said .
german nhl star christian ehrhoff of the vancouver canucks could barely conceal his frustration .
" i 'm disappointed .
it 's difficult to find the words .
we were so close , but the russians capitalized on our mistake , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russia launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal one man 's worst nightmare that fatal mistake came off the stick of philipp gogulla , the man who just two nights before scored the winning goal against switzerland to propel the german team into the semifinals in the first place .
with a little over two minutes to go in the third period , gogulla grabbed the puck in the german zone .
he accelerated up the right side , but without looking backhanded a sloppy pass intended for his teammate at center ice .
russian star pavel datsyuk intercepted it and streaked toward the german goal on a two-on-one break .
datsyuk buried the puck himself on the short side of german goaltender rob zepp .
it was the only time in the game that zepp did not look good .
russia now goes on to play the czech republic in sunday 's gold medal game .
germany meets sweden , which lost 3-2 to the czechs in the other semifinal on saturday afternoon , for the bronze .
" against sweden , we 're going to give it everything we 've got again .
we want a medal , " said ehrhoff. gb / sid / dpa / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?

although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture of harmony - fforst students in their club room a year later , they moved into such a multi-story building just to make a film about their idea . but then they never moved out , rescuing the building from its planned demolition - and so the fforst house-sharing community was born .
although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 22.05.2010 un 's extended mandate exposes sudan 's instability and mission 's frailties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan experiences an uneasy peace but tensions are rising the un security council extended the mandate of the un 's mission in sudan for another year earlier in may as tensions over a referendum on independence begin to pull at the threads of an already fragile peace agreement . the un mission in sudan -lrb- unmis -rrb- was created to back up the 2005 agreement which ended two decades of civil war between the north and south that killed at least two million people .
the expected 2011 referendum on the agreement will determine whether the country 's south secedes from the north and who gets control of the disputed oil-rich region of abyei and its resources . unmis has a broad mandate , ranging from monitoring the north-south peace agreement to promoting the rule of law and coordinating humanitarian aid .
the new mandate now hones its focus on next year 's independence referendum . an uneasy peace currently exists between the government in khartoum in the north and the sudan people 's liberation movement in the south but experts believe that the referendum next year could reignite the violence of the past .
the new un mandate will keep the approximately 10,000 troops and military observers in the country until april 30 next year in the bid to protect civilians , relief and development workers and refugees should hostilities resume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president al-bashir has been accused of war crimes in sudan the chances of a new conflict seem to be increasing .
secretary-general ban ki-moon has expressed concern there has been " little concrete progress " made between the government and secessionists in preparing for the referendum while the divide between them widens . the un also criticized national elections organized in mid-april in which sudanese president omar al-bashir , who first took power in late 1980s , was reelected . the un has expressed its concern that al-bashir , who has been indicted by the international criminal court on genocide charges , is behind the irregularities and the lack of preparations and education of voters which have sewn more seeds of distrust among rival parties . in turn , the sudanese view of the un mission continues to be , on the whole , an unfavorable one .
the mission has been criticized by some for reacting too late to the humanitarian crisis arising from the civil war and it has remained unpopular with many sudanese . opinion drawn from harsh reality of un presence allan duncan , a british development consultant who has worked in sudan for five years , said that the idea of living in a region with a peacekeeping force was very different from the reality ; something that has contributed to the sudanese attitude towards the un . " southern sudan was the first country i have worked in where there had been a peace-keeping force , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had always imagined that there would be lines of blue helmets out there in the street on a daily basis as a show of strength and force that would provide security and stability for the civil population within unstable environments . " " what actually happens is several thousand bangladeshi soldiers turn up at the airport one day and then go to their camp , the next time you see them is when they are leaving at the airport again .
in the five years that i worked in juba i could count on one hand the amount of un patrols that i saw in the street .
saying that , when small scale fighting did break out in the upper nile area over the past few years they did deploy troops between the factions and managed to dissipate the tension and flash points in the area . " un mission facing growing unease in southern sudan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its best efforts , the un mission has been criticized " unmis has a mixed reputation , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" it originally deployed slowly , and has been accused of responding slowly to outbreaks of violence in south sudan - although it did deploy troops to a number of at-risk areas last year , apparently deterring attacks .
south sudan remains volatile - over 400 civilians have been killed there this year alone - and there are reports that the population is dissatisfied with the un 's performance . " " the mission has also suffered from a shortage of civilian experts , and is constrained by south sudan 's lack of good roads and basic infrastructure .
these factors set limits on what the mission can achieve , " gowan added .
" the good news is that the un has now sent a new team of senior officials , headed by senior african diplomat haile menkerios , to take control of the situation .
menkerios is very well-respected , and has a clear grasp of the sudanese situation . " despite this , there is some concern that unmis may not be able to cope in its current form should the peace accord collapse and sudan is plunged once more into civil war .
the mission 's operating area is huge and it only has around 9,000 soldiers with the military primarily focused on monitoring the situation rather than protecting civilians directly . current mission status not strong enough to deal with war many experts believe that the mission will face very serious tests if the south votes for independence next year .
there is a high chance that this will lead to a wave of violence , and that un forces will come under pressure to react more forcefully than they have before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmis may not have enough troops to deal with conflict " the un may have to call for extra troops - either bringing in soldiers from its unamid mission in darfur , or having to ask another organization like the eu to send rapid reaction forces , " richard gowan said . " beyond any immediate crisis , there may be calls for the un to take on a more extensive role in building up a new state in south sudan - some experts are even talking about giving it the sort of executive mandate it had in kosovo and east timor .
for now , unmis has to try and head off violence around the referendum .
the odds are daunting , and unmis needs all the help it can get . " the scale of a potential crisis surrounding the independence referendum could also expose the un 's frailties elsewhere and could lead to further problems in the already crisis hit region of darfur .
" while the un was guilty of prioritizing darfur over south sudan in recent years - and so failed to see how dangerous the south was becoming - it now risks ignoring darfur 's ongoing crisis as it tries to save the south , " said gowan . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected 2011 referendum on the agreement will determine whether the country 's south secedes from the north and who gets control of the disputed oil-rich region of abyei and its resources . unmis has a broad mandate , ranging from monitoring the north-south peace agreement to promoting the rule of law and coordinating humanitarian aid .
the new mandate now hones its focus on next year 's independence referendum . an uneasy peace currently exists between the government in khartoum in the north and the sudan people 's liberation movement in the south but experts believe that the referendum next year could reignite the violence of the past .
the new un mandate will keep the approximately 10,000 troops and military observers in the country until april 30 next year in the bid to protect civilians , relief and development workers and refugees should hostilities resume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president al-bashir has been accused of war crimes in sudan the chances of a new conflict seem to be increasing .

the mission has been criticized by some for reacting too late to the humanitarian crisis arising from the civil war and it has remained unpopular with many sudanese . opinion drawn from harsh reality of un presence allan duncan , a british development consultant who has worked in sudan for five years , said that the idea of living in a region with a peacekeeping force was very different from the reality ; something that has contributed to the sudanese attitude towards the un . " southern sudan was the first country i have worked in where there had been a peace-keeping force , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had always imagined that there would be lines of blue helmets out there in the street on a daily basis as a show of strength and force that would provide security and stability for the civil population within unstable environments . " " what actually happens is several thousand bangladeshi soldiers turn up at the airport one day and then go to their camp , the next time you see them is when they are leaving at the airport again .

" " the mission has also suffered from a shortage of civilian experts , and is constrained by south sudan 's lack of good roads and basic infrastructure .

menkerios is very well-respected , and has a clear grasp of the sudanese situation . " despite this , there is some concern that unmis may not be able to cope in its current form should the peace accord collapse and sudan is plunged once more into civil war .
the mission 's operating area is huge and it only has around 9,000 soldiers with the military primarily focused on monitoring the situation rather than protecting civilians directly . current mission status not strong enough to deal with war many experts believe that the mission will face very serious tests if the south votes for independence next year .

" we have super fans .
they suffer with us but they also celebrate with us when we lose . "
" we won the league and the cup .
we lost the champions league but it does n't matter ...
i love all fans from bayern munich , " said french player franck ribery .
the 27-year-old midfielder enjoyed an especially warm welcome from fans following sunday 's announcement that he had signed a new contract to stay with the team until 2015 .
" we 're delighted we 've reached agreement on a contract extension with one of the world 's best players , " rummenigge told the bundesliga club 's website .

bildunterschrift : fans welcomed the team at munich 's central marienplatz unprecedented win after winning the serie a and coppa italia earlier in the season , inter milan ’ s victory over bayern munich meant the team had secured an unprecedented treble .
it was inter milan 's third champions league triumph after successes in 1964 and 1965 .
portuguese manager jose mourinho became only the third coach to win the european cup with two different clubs following his success with porto in 2004 .
the convincing victory ends a 45-year drought for the italian champions in europe 's prestige soccer tournament .

he also got the winner in the italian cup final .
" it 's a joy i 've never experienced .
incredible .
i am so happy for inter because we wanted this so badly .
we are so happy and it 's a unique sensation , " milito told reporters .
the loss meant that bayern , after a very successful season with new coach louis van gaal , missed out on the treble , having also won in the german leagues this year .
" inter were the better team over 90 minutes and deserved to win , " former bayern president franz beckenbauer told german tv .
even though bayern had a lot of possession , samuel eto 'o and milito were a constant threat to the bayern defense and inter were able to convert their goal scoring chances .
inter milan 's superb display of soccer skill and passion was typified by excellent skipper javier zanetti , who was playing in his 700th match for the club. cmk / nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : gabriel borrud send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the semifinal match began like a fairy tale , however , with germany 's marcel goc scoring the go-ahead goal in the 16th minute .
the puck took a lucky bounce in a scramble in front of the russian net and goc chipped it past goalie vasili koshechkin .
russia stuck to its game plan and launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal with a team of international stars that read like the who 's who of ice hockey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany put up a great fight against the russians but it took until 12 minutes into the second period before one of them , yevgeni malkin , put away a blistering slapshot that was so fast the cameras could n't even see it .
with the score tied at one all , the teams returned to their dressing rooms for the second break with the russians wondering how they were ever going to win this match against a german team that knew it had to play the game of its life to win - and did its best to do just that .
the germans - and the russians - had oodles of scoring opportunities , but good defense and great goaltending on both sides pushed the sold-out crowd of 18,734 german and russian fans in the cologne arena to the brink of a communal nervous breakdown .
german coach uwe krupp called it one of the best games his team had ever played .
" we had chances to score a second and third goal .
but the russians scored instead .
that was the difference , " he said .
german nhl star christian ehrhoff of the vancouver canucks could barely conceal his frustration .
" i 'm disappointed .
it 's difficult to find the words .
we were so close , but the russians capitalized on our mistake , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russia launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal one man 's worst nightmare that fatal mistake came off the stick of philipp gogulla , the man who just two nights before scored the winning goal against switzerland to propel the german team into the semifinals in the first place .
with a little over two minutes to go in the third period , gogulla grabbed the puck in the german zone .
he accelerated up the right side , but without looking backhanded a sloppy pass intended for his teammate at center ice .
russian star pavel datsyuk intercepted it and streaked toward the german goal on a two-on-one break .
datsyuk buried the puck himself on the short side of german goaltender rob zepp .
it was the only time in the game that zepp did not look good .
russia now goes on to play the czech republic in sunday 's gold medal game .
germany meets sweden , which lost 3-2 to the czechs in the other semifinal on saturday afternoon , for the bronze .
" against sweden , we 're going to give it everything we 've got again .
we want a medal , " said ehrhoff. gb / sid / dpa / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture of harmony - fforst students in their club room a year later , they moved into such a multi-story building just to make a film about their idea . but then they never moved out , rescuing the building from its planned demolition - and so the fforst house-sharing community was born .
although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .
" i ask that we consider what has a chance internationally , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief steinmeier said the transaction tax was essential opposition dissent perhaps the strongest support for the transaction tax has come from the opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who abstained from a vote on a eurozone bailout fund on friday largely because merkel 's government has not sufficiently supported the tax .
party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .
" we need this revenue to invest in the future and to secure our social welfare state , " he told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture of harmony - fforst students in their club room a year later , they moved into such a multi-story building just to make a film about their idea . but then they never moved out , rescuing the building from its planned demolition - and so the fforst house-sharing community was born .
although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .

the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture of harmony - fforst students in their club room a year later , they moved into such a multi-story building just to make a film about their idea . but then they never moved out , rescuing the building from its planned demolition - and so the fforst house-sharing community was born .
although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .

although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .

egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .
his three-day mideast trip is designed to coincide with chancellor angela merkel 's upcoming trip to the arabian peninsula , according to diplomatic officials. nrt / mz / acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .
" i ask that we consider what has a chance internationally , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief steinmeier said the transaction tax was essential opposition dissent perhaps the strongest support for the transaction tax has come from the opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who abstained from a vote on a eurozone bailout fund on friday largely because merkel 's government has not sufficiently supported the tax .
party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .
" we need this revenue to invest in the future and to secure our social welfare state , " he told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia has adapted its approach to iran and shown restraint in arms transfers , " state department spokesman philip crowley told news agency afp .
" this has given us confidence to lift these penalties while protecting our non-proliferation interests . "
crowley said a " good example " of moscow 's changing priorities was its decision to suspend a contract to deliver s300 air defence missiles to iran .
two of the organizations , the moscow aviation institute and d. mendeleyev university , were put under sanctions in 1999 during bill clinton 's presidency .
the third organization , russian state arms exporter rosoboronexport , had been under sanctions since 2008 .
the us also lifted sanctions on a fourth company , the tula instrument design bureau , which had been restricted since 1999 for allegedly selling anti-tank equipment to syria .
bildunterschrift : the us hopes to have russian support for un sanctions against iran shifting us-russian ties the lifting of the sanctions , which was published in the official state publication the federal register on friday , suggests efforts by the obama administration to increase cooperation with russia .
last month , us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev signed a historic agreement to reduce each country 's nuclear arsenal by one third , a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- .
the united states has also been seeking international support for new united nations security council sanctions against iran for its nuclear program , and russia 's status as a permanent member with veto power makes it a necessary ally. acb / afp / ap editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .
" i ask that we consider what has a chance internationally , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief steinmeier said the transaction tax was essential opposition dissent perhaps the strongest support for the transaction tax has come from the opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who abstained from a vote on a eurozone bailout fund on friday largely because merkel 's government has not sufficiently supported the tax .
party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .
" we need this revenue to invest in the future and to secure our social welfare state , " he told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .

the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .

the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .

party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 22.05.2010 idealistic students transform tower block into a community großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students seek a maximum of liberty in their house young adults studying at frankfurt-an-der-oder 's viadrina university have turned a dull prefab tower block from the 1980s into their self-administered dream home – and thus saved it from demolition . among the rows of prefab tower blocks in an old east german residential area in the center of frankfurt-an-der-oder , one block stands out .
its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture of harmony - fforst students in their club room a year later , they moved into such a multi-story building just to make a film about their idea . but then they never moved out , rescuing the building from its planned demolition - and so the fforst house-sharing community was born .
although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .

although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

the news came as the irish airline announced plans for fresh investment in germany . germany 's federal court of justice ruled on thursday that ryanair put customers at a disadvantage by charging them a fee for using a credit or debit card to pay for tickets .
by charging the fee , the airline was thrusting on customers the costs of fulfilling its own legal obligations , the court , based in the southwestern town of karlsruhe , said .
germany 's leading consumer organization brought the case against the irish budget airline for charging a fee of between 1.50 and 4 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 - $ 5 -rrb- per passenger , saying ryanair did not offer consumers any way to pay for flights without paying an additional fee .
however , no fee was charged for paying with a visa electron card , a sister card to the visa debit card .
ryanair had argued that it was simply passing on to consumers the fee banks charge for credit card payments .
ryanair to create new jobs the court ruling came as ryanair announced plans to build a 25-million-euro crew training facility and maintenance hangar at frankfurt 's hahn airport .
the airline said the fresh investment would create up to 200 new jobs in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says it plans to invest 25 million euros in new facilities in germany ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary told a press conference in the city of mainz on thursday that , among other things , his airline intended to invest in two flight simulators and an airplane fuselage for training purposes .
he said the company was planning to rent a large maintenance hall that the airport will arrange for an investor to build at a cost of about 8 million euros .
o 'leary said construction work was due to begin in july .
starting in december , a major part of ryanair 's fleet would be serviced at hahn , he added .
about 1.5 million euros would be invested in a training center , located in an existing building , and the new facility would be in use as soon as august .
o 'leary added that ryanair intended to boost the number of planes it has based at hahn from 11 to 16 over the next five years , creating 350 new jobs .
the number of passengers was expected to rise from four million to six million a year .
hendrik hering , transport minister of the state of rhineland palatinate , where the airport is situated , said he was pleased with the decision .
he said the airline 's expansion plans were likely to attract other investors because it was now clear that ryanair intended to stay at hahn airport. rb / apb / dpa editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 22.05.2010 divisions emerge in german government over transaction tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners generally oppose new taxes days after the german center-right coalition government presented a unified front on a new tax on the financial sector , parliamentary and cabinet leaders have made skeptical statements over its feasibility . disagreements in the german government over a financial transaction tax resurfaced as the finance minister made statements saying that a global tax would likely be rejected by the united states .
" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 22.05.2010 germans lose heartbreaker to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians missed a lot of great opportunities the german national ice hockey team succumbed to russia with just two minutes left in their semifinal match on saturday , setting up a gold medal game between russia and the czech republic . the world ice hockey championship experienced another thriller in cologne on saturday with underdogs germany putting up a scrappy fight against a world-class russian team , falling in the end by a mere two goals to one .
the semifinal match began like a fairy tale , however , with germany 's marcel goc scoring the go-ahead goal in the 16th minute .
the puck took a lucky bounce in a scramble in front of the russian net and goc chipped it past goalie vasili koshechkin .
russia stuck to its game plan and launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal with a team of international stars that read like the who 's who of ice hockey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany put up a great fight against the russians but it took until 12 minutes into the second period before one of them , yevgeni malkin , put away a blistering slapshot that was so fast the cameras could n't even see it .
with the score tied at one all , the teams returned to their dressing rooms for the second break with the russians wondering how they were ever going to win this match against a german team that knew it had to play the game of its life to win - and did its best to do just that .
the germans - and the russians - had oodles of scoring opportunities , but good defense and great goaltending on both sides pushed the sold-out crowd of 18,734 german and russian fans in the cologne arena to the brink of a communal nervous breakdown .
german coach uwe krupp called it one of the best games his team had ever played .
" we had chances to score a second and third goal .
but the russians scored instead .
that was the difference , " he said .
german nhl star christian ehrhoff of the vancouver canucks could barely conceal his frustration .
" i 'm disappointed .
it 's difficult to find the words .
we were so close , but the russians capitalized on our mistake , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russia launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal one man 's worst nightmare that fatal mistake came off the stick of philipp gogulla , the man who just two nights before scored the winning goal against switzerland to propel the german team into the semifinals in the first place .
with a little over two minutes to go in the third period , gogulla grabbed the puck in the german zone .
he accelerated up the right side , but without looking backhanded a sloppy pass intended for his teammate at center ice .
russian star pavel datsyuk intercepted it and streaked toward the german goal on a two-on-one break .
datsyuk buried the puck himself on the short side of german goaltender rob zepp .
it was the only time in the game that zepp did not look good .
russia now goes on to play the czech republic in sunday 's gold medal game .
germany meets sweden , which lost 3-2 to the czechs in the other semifinal on saturday afternoon , for the bronze .
" against sweden , we 're going to give it everything we 've got again .
we want a medal , " said ehrhoff. gb / sid / dpa / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the semifinal match began like a fairy tale , however , with germany 's marcel goc scoring the go-ahead goal in the 16th minute .
the puck took a lucky bounce in a scramble in front of the russian net and goc chipped it past goalie vasili koshechkin .
russia stuck to its game plan and launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal with a team of international stars that read like the who 's who of ice hockey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany put up a great fight against the russians but it took until 12 minutes into the second period before one of them , yevgeni malkin , put away a blistering slapshot that was so fast the cameras could n't even see it .
with the score tied at one all , the teams returned to their dressing rooms for the second break with the russians wondering how they were ever going to win this match against a german team that knew it had to play the game of its life to win - and did its best to do just that .
the germans - and the russians - had oodles of scoring opportunities , but good defense and great goaltending on both sides pushed the sold-out crowd of 18,734 german and russian fans in the cologne arena to the brink of a communal nervous breakdown .
german coach uwe krupp called it one of the best games his team had ever played .
" we had chances to score a second and third goal .
but the russians scored instead .
that was the difference , " he said .
german nhl star christian ehrhoff of the vancouver canucks could barely conceal his frustration .
" i 'm disappointed .
it 's difficult to find the words .
we were so close , but the russians capitalized on our mistake , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russia launched wave after wave of attacks against the german goal one man 's worst nightmare that fatal mistake came off the stick of philipp gogulla , the man who just two nights before scored the winning goal against switzerland to propel the german team into the semifinals in the first place .
with a little over two minutes to go in the third period , gogulla grabbed the puck in the german zone .
he accelerated up the right side , but without looking backhanded a sloppy pass intended for his teammate at center ice .
russian star pavel datsyuk intercepted it and streaked toward the german goal on a two-on-one break .
datsyuk buried the puck himself on the short side of german goaltender rob zepp .
it was the only time in the game that zepp did not look good .
russia now goes on to play the czech republic in sunday 's gold medal game .
germany meets sweden , which lost 3-2 to the czechs in the other semifinal on saturday afternoon , for the bronze .
" against sweden , we 're going to give it everything we 've got again .
we want a medal , " said ehrhoff. gb / sid / dpa / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia has adapted its approach to iran and shown restraint in arms transfers , " state department spokesman philip crowley told news agency afp .
" this has given us confidence to lift these penalties while protecting our non-proliferation interests . "
crowley said a " good example " of moscow 's changing priorities was its decision to suspend a contract to deliver s300 air defence missiles to iran .
two of the organizations , the moscow aviation institute and d. mendeleyev university , were put under sanctions in 1999 during bill clinton 's presidency .
the third organization , russian state arms exporter rosoboronexport , had been under sanctions since 2008 .
the us also lifted sanctions on a fourth company , the tula instrument design bureau , which had been restricted since 1999 for allegedly selling anti-tank equipment to syria .
bildunterschrift : the us hopes to have russian support for un sanctions against iran shifting us-russian ties the lifting of the sanctions , which was published in the official state publication the federal register on friday , suggests efforts by the obama administration to increase cooperation with russia .
last month , us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev signed a historic agreement to reduce each country 's nuclear arsenal by one third , a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- .
the united states has also been seeking international support for new united nations security council sanctions against iran for its nuclear program , and russia 's status as a permanent member with veto power makes it a necessary ally. acb / afp / ap editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected 2011 referendum on the agreement will determine whether the country 's south secedes from the north and who gets control of the disputed oil-rich region of abyei and its resources . unmis has a broad mandate , ranging from monitoring the north-south peace agreement to promoting the rule of law and coordinating humanitarian aid .
the new mandate now hones its focus on next year 's independence referendum . an uneasy peace currently exists between the government in khartoum in the north and the sudan people 's liberation movement in the south but experts believe that the referendum next year could reignite the violence of the past .
the new un mandate will keep the approximately 10,000 troops and military observers in the country until april 30 next year in the bid to protect civilians , relief and development workers and refugees should hostilities resume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president al-bashir has been accused of war crimes in sudan the chances of a new conflict seem to be increasing .
secretary-general ban ki-moon has expressed concern there has been " little concrete progress " made between the government and secessionists in preparing for the referendum while the divide between them widens . the un also criticized national elections organized in mid-april in which sudanese president omar al-bashir , who first took power in late 1980s , was reelected . the un has expressed its concern that al-bashir , who has been indicted by the international criminal court on genocide charges , is behind the irregularities and the lack of preparations and education of voters which have sewn more seeds of distrust among rival parties . in turn , the sudanese view of the un mission continues to be , on the whole , an unfavorable one .
the mission has been criticized by some for reacting too late to the humanitarian crisis arising from the civil war and it has remained unpopular with many sudanese . opinion drawn from harsh reality of un presence allan duncan , a british development consultant who has worked in sudan for five years , said that the idea of living in a region with a peacekeeping force was very different from the reality ; something that has contributed to the sudanese attitude towards the un . " southern sudan was the first country i have worked in where there had been a peace-keeping force , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had always imagined that there would be lines of blue helmets out there in the street on a daily basis as a show of strength and force that would provide security and stability for the civil population within unstable environments . " " what actually happens is several thousand bangladeshi soldiers turn up at the airport one day and then go to their camp , the next time you see them is when they are leaving at the airport again .
in the five years that i worked in juba i could count on one hand the amount of un patrols that i saw in the street .
saying that , when small scale fighting did break out in the upper nile area over the past few years they did deploy troops between the factions and managed to dissipate the tension and flash points in the area . " un mission facing growing unease in southern sudan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its best efforts , the un mission has been criticized " unmis has a mixed reputation , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" it originally deployed slowly , and has been accused of responding slowly to outbreaks of violence in south sudan - although it did deploy troops to a number of at-risk areas last year , apparently deterring attacks .
south sudan remains volatile - over 400 civilians have been killed there this year alone - and there are reports that the population is dissatisfied with the un 's performance . " " the mission has also suffered from a shortage of civilian experts , and is constrained by south sudan 's lack of good roads and basic infrastructure .
these factors set limits on what the mission can achieve , " gowan added .
" the good news is that the un has now sent a new team of senior officials , headed by senior african diplomat haile menkerios , to take control of the situation .
menkerios is very well-respected , and has a clear grasp of the sudanese situation . " despite this , there is some concern that unmis may not be able to cope in its current form should the peace accord collapse and sudan is plunged once more into civil war .
the mission 's operating area is huge and it only has around 9,000 soldiers with the military primarily focused on monitoring the situation rather than protecting civilians directly . current mission status not strong enough to deal with war many experts believe that the mission will face very serious tests if the south votes for independence next year .
there is a high chance that this will lead to a wave of violence , and that un forces will come under pressure to react more forcefully than they have before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmis may not have enough troops to deal with conflict " the un may have to call for extra troops - either bringing in soldiers from its unamid mission in darfur , or having to ask another organization like the eu to send rapid reaction forces , " richard gowan said . " beyond any immediate crisis , there may be calls for the un to take on a more extensive role in building up a new state in south sudan - some experts are even talking about giving it the sort of executive mandate it had in kosovo and east timor .
for now , unmis has to try and head off violence around the referendum .
the odds are daunting , and unmis needs all the help it can get . " the scale of a potential crisis surrounding the independence referendum could also expose the un 's frailties elsewhere and could lead to further problems in the already crisis hit region of darfur .
" while the un was guilty of prioritizing darfur over south sudan in recent years - and so failed to see how dangerous the south was becoming - it now risks ignoring darfur 's ongoing crisis as it tries to save the south , " said gowan . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected 2011 referendum on the agreement will determine whether the country 's south secedes from the north and who gets control of the disputed oil-rich region of abyei and its resources . unmis has a broad mandate , ranging from monitoring the north-south peace agreement to promoting the rule of law and coordinating humanitarian aid .
the new mandate now hones its focus on next year 's independence referendum . an uneasy peace currently exists between the government in khartoum in the north and the sudan people 's liberation movement in the south but experts believe that the referendum next year could reignite the violence of the past .
the new un mandate will keep the approximately 10,000 troops and military observers in the country until april 30 next year in the bid to protect civilians , relief and development workers and refugees should hostilities resume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president al-bashir has been accused of war crimes in sudan the chances of a new conflict seem to be increasing .
secretary-general ban ki-moon has expressed concern there has been " little concrete progress " made between the government and secessionists in preparing for the referendum while the divide between them widens . the un also criticized national elections organized in mid-april in which sudanese president omar al-bashir , who first took power in late 1980s , was reelected . the un has expressed its concern that al-bashir , who has been indicted by the international criminal court on genocide charges , is behind the irregularities and the lack of preparations and education of voters which have sewn more seeds of distrust among rival parties . in turn , the sudanese view of the un mission continues to be , on the whole , an unfavorable one .
the mission has been criticized by some for reacting too late to the humanitarian crisis arising from the civil war and it has remained unpopular with many sudanese . opinion drawn from harsh reality of un presence allan duncan , a british development consultant who has worked in sudan for five years , said that the idea of living in a region with a peacekeeping force was very different from the reality ; something that has contributed to the sudanese attitude towards the un . " southern sudan was the first country i have worked in where there had been a peace-keeping force , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had always imagined that there would be lines of blue helmets out there in the street on a daily basis as a show of strength and force that would provide security and stability for the civil population within unstable environments . " " what actually happens is several thousand bangladeshi soldiers turn up at the airport one day and then go to their camp , the next time you see them is when they are leaving at the airport again .
in the five years that i worked in juba i could count on one hand the amount of un patrols that i saw in the street .
saying that , when small scale fighting did break out in the upper nile area over the past few years they did deploy troops between the factions and managed to dissipate the tension and flash points in the area . " un mission facing growing unease in southern sudan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its best efforts , the un mission has been criticized " unmis has a mixed reputation , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" it originally deployed slowly , and has been accused of responding slowly to outbreaks of violence in south sudan - although it did deploy troops to a number of at-risk areas last year , apparently deterring attacks .
south sudan remains volatile - over 400 civilians have been killed there this year alone - and there are reports that the population is dissatisfied with the un 's performance . " " the mission has also suffered from a shortage of civilian experts , and is constrained by south sudan 's lack of good roads and basic infrastructure .
these factors set limits on what the mission can achieve , " gowan added .
" the good news is that the un has now sent a new team of senior officials , headed by senior african diplomat haile menkerios , to take control of the situation .
menkerios is very well-respected , and has a clear grasp of the sudanese situation . " despite this , there is some concern that unmis may not be able to cope in its current form should the peace accord collapse and sudan is plunged once more into civil war .
the mission 's operating area is huge and it only has around 9,000 soldiers with the military primarily focused on monitoring the situation rather than protecting civilians directly . current mission status not strong enough to deal with war many experts believe that the mission will face very serious tests if the south votes for independence next year .
there is a high chance that this will lead to a wave of violence , and that un forces will come under pressure to react more forcefully than they have before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmis may not have enough troops to deal with conflict " the un may have to call for extra troops - either bringing in soldiers from its unamid mission in darfur , or having to ask another organization like the eu to send rapid reaction forces , " richard gowan said . " beyond any immediate crisis , there may be calls for the un to take on a more extensive role in building up a new state in south sudan - some experts are even talking about giving it the sort of executive mandate it had in kosovo and east timor .
for now , unmis has to try and head off violence around the referendum .
the odds are daunting , and unmis needs all the help it can get . " the scale of a potential crisis surrounding the independence referendum could also expose the un 's frailties elsewhere and could lead to further problems in the already crisis hit region of darfur .
" while the un was guilty of prioritizing darfur over south sudan in recent years - and so failed to see how dangerous the south was becoming - it now risks ignoring darfur 's ongoing crisis as it tries to save the south , " said gowan . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission 's operating area is huge and it only has around 9,000 soldiers with the military primarily focused on monitoring the situation rather than protecting civilians directly . current mission status not strong enough to deal with war many experts believe that the mission will face very serious tests if the south votes for independence next year .
there is a high chance that this will lead to a wave of violence , and that un forces will come under pressure to react more forcefully than they have before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmis may not have enough troops to deal with conflict " the un may have to call for extra troops - either bringing in soldiers from its unamid mission in darfur , or having to ask another organization like the eu to send rapid reaction forces , " richard gowan said . " beyond any immediate crisis , there may be calls for the un to take on a more extensive role in building up a new state in south sudan - some experts are even talking about giving it the sort of executive mandate it had in kosovo and east timor .
for now , unmis has to try and head off violence around the referendum .
the odds are daunting , and unmis needs all the help it can get . " the scale of a potential crisis surrounding the independence referendum could also expose the un 's frailties elsewhere and could lead to further problems in the already crisis hit region of darfur .
" while the un was guilty of prioritizing darfur over south sudan in recent years - and so failed to see how dangerous the south was becoming - it now risks ignoring darfur 's ongoing crisis as it tries to save the south , " said gowan . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia has adapted its approach to iran and shown restraint in arms transfers , " state department spokesman philip crowley told news agency afp .
" this has given us confidence to lift these penalties while protecting our non-proliferation interests . "
crowley said a " good example " of moscow 's changing priorities was its decision to suspend a contract to deliver s300 air defence missiles to iran .
two of the organizations , the moscow aviation institute and d. mendeleyev university , were put under sanctions in 1999 during bill clinton 's presidency .
the third organization , russian state arms exporter rosoboronexport , had been under sanctions since 2008 .
the us also lifted sanctions on a fourth company , the tula instrument design bureau , which had been restricted since 1999 for allegedly selling anti-tank equipment to syria .
bildunterschrift : the us hopes to have russian support for un sanctions against iran shifting us-russian ties the lifting of the sanctions , which was published in the official state publication the federal register on friday , suggests efforts by the obama administration to increase cooperation with russia .
last month , us president barack obama and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev signed a historic agreement to reduce each country 's nuclear arsenal by one third , a successor to the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- .
the united states has also been seeking international support for new united nations security council sanctions against iran for its nuclear program , and russia 's status as a permanent member with veto power makes it a necessary ally. acb / afp / ap editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 22.05.2010 idealistic students transform tower block into a community großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students seek a maximum of liberty in their house young adults studying at frankfurt-an-der-oder 's viadrina university have turned a dull prefab tower block from the 1980s into their self-administered dream home – and thus saved it from demolition . among the rows of prefab tower blocks in an old east german residential area in the center of frankfurt-an-der-oder , one block stands out .
its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture of harmony - fforst students in their club room a year later , they moved into such a multi-story building just to make a film about their idea . but then they never moved out , rescuing the building from its planned demolition - and so the fforst house-sharing community was born .
although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .

although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .
win-win situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture of harmony - fforst students in their club room a year later , they moved into such a multi-story building just to make a film about their idea . but then they never moved out , rescuing the building from its planned demolition - and so the fforst house-sharing community was born .
although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

the news came as the irish airline announced plans for fresh investment in germany . germany 's federal court of justice ruled on thursday that ryanair put customers at a disadvantage by charging them a fee for using a credit or debit card to pay for tickets .
by charging the fee , the airline was thrusting on customers the costs of fulfilling its own legal obligations , the court , based in the southwestern town of karlsruhe , said .
germany 's leading consumer organization brought the case against the irish budget airline for charging a fee of between 1.50 and 4 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 - $ 5 -rrb- per passenger , saying ryanair did not offer consumers any way to pay for flights without paying an additional fee .
however , no fee was charged for paying with a visa electron card , a sister card to the visa debit card .
ryanair had argued that it was simply passing on to consumers the fee banks charge for credit card payments .
ryanair to create new jobs the court ruling came as ryanair announced plans to build a 25-million-euro crew training facility and maintenance hangar at frankfurt 's hahn airport .
the airline said the fresh investment would create up to 200 new jobs in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says it plans to invest 25 million euros in new facilities in germany ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary told a press conference in the city of mainz on thursday that , among other things , his airline intended to invest in two flight simulators and an airplane fuselage for training purposes .
he said the company was planning to rent a large maintenance hall that the airport will arrange for an investor to build at a cost of about 8 million euros .
o 'leary said construction work was due to begin in july .
starting in december , a major part of ryanair 's fleet would be serviced at hahn , he added .
about 1.5 million euros would be invested in a training center , located in an existing building , and the new facility would be in use as soon as august .
o 'leary added that ryanair intended to boost the number of planes it has based at hahn from 11 to 16 over the next five years , creating 350 new jobs .
the number of passengers was expected to rise from four million to six million a year .
hendrik hering , transport minister of the state of rhineland palatinate , where the airport is situated , said he was pleased with the decision .
he said the airline 's expansion plans were likely to attract other investors because it was now clear that ryanair intended to stay at hahn airport. rb / apb / dpa editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the highly-anticipated restructuring plan of general motors ' european unit is designed to qualify the company for state guarantees from the german government .
workers at opel agreed to a series of cuts that would amount to 265 million euros -lrb- $ 333 million -rrb- per year through 2014 .
the bulk of the money will come from salary freezes , reduced bonuses and holiday pay , and some layoffs that will eliminate just over 8,000 of opel 's 50,000-member workforce in europe .
about half of those cuts would come at the german factory in russelsheim , where most european opel employees work .

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .
" i ask that we consider what has a chance internationally , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief steinmeier said the transaction tax was essential opposition dissent perhaps the strongest support for the transaction tax has come from the opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who abstained from a vote on a eurozone bailout fund on friday largely because merkel 's government has not sufficiently supported the tax .
party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .
" we need this revenue to invest in the future and to secure our social welfare state , " he told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .
" i ask that we consider what has a chance internationally , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief steinmeier said the transaction tax was essential opposition dissent perhaps the strongest support for the transaction tax has come from the opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who abstained from a vote on a eurozone bailout fund on friday largely because merkel 's government has not sufficiently supported the tax .
party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .
" we need this revenue to invest in the future and to secure our social welfare state , " he told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i love all fans from bayern munich , " said french player franck ribery .
the 27-year-old midfielder enjoyed an especially warm welcome from fans following sunday 's announcement that he had signed a new contract to stay with the team until 2015 .
" we 're delighted we 've reached agreement on a contract extension with one of the world 's best players , " rummenigge told the bundesliga club 's website .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .

" we have super fans .
they suffer with us but they also celebrate with us when we lose . "
" we won the league and the cup .
we lost the champions league but it does n't matter ...
i love all fans from bayern munich , " said french player franck ribery .
the 27-year-old midfielder enjoyed an especially warm welcome from fans following sunday 's announcement that he had signed a new contract to stay with the team until 2015 .
" we 're delighted we 've reached agreement on a contract extension with one of the world 's best players , " rummenigge told the bundesliga club 's website .

" it 's a joy i 've never experienced .
incredible .
i am so happy for inter because we wanted this so badly .
we are so happy and it 's a unique sensation , " milito told reporters .

" inter were the better team over 90 minutes and deserved to win , " former bayern president franz beckenbauer told german tv .
even though bayern had a lot of possession , samuel eto 'o and milito were a constant threat to the bayern defense and inter were able to convert their goal scoring chances .
inter milan 's superb display of soccer skill and passion was typified by excellent skipper javier zanetti , who was playing in his 700th match for the club. cmk / nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : gabriel borrud send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .

the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .

two of the organizations , the moscow aviation institute and d. mendeleyev university , were put under sanctions in 1999 during bill clinton 's presidency .

the expected 2011 referendum on the agreement will determine whether the country 's south secedes from the north and who gets control of the disputed oil-rich region of abyei and its resources . unmis has a broad mandate , ranging from monitoring the north-south peace agreement to promoting the rule of law and coordinating humanitarian aid .
the new mandate now hones its focus on next year 's independence referendum . an uneasy peace currently exists between the government in khartoum in the north and the sudan people 's liberation movement in the south but experts believe that the referendum next year could reignite the violence of the past .
the new un mandate will keep the approximately 10,000 troops and military observers in the country until april 30 next year in the bid to protect civilians , relief and development workers and refugees should hostilities resume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president al-bashir has been accused of war crimes in sudan the chances of a new conflict seem to be increasing .
secretary-general ban ki-moon has expressed concern there has been " little concrete progress " made between the government and secessionists in preparing for the referendum while the divide between them widens . the un also criticized national elections organized in mid-april in which sudanese president omar al-bashir , who first took power in late 1980s , was reelected . the un has expressed its concern that al-bashir , who has been indicted by the international criminal court on genocide charges , is behind the irregularities and the lack of preparations and education of voters which have sewn more seeds of distrust among rival parties . in turn , the sudanese view of the un mission continues to be , on the whole , an unfavorable one .
the mission has been criticized by some for reacting too late to the humanitarian crisis arising from the civil war and it has remained unpopular with many sudanese . opinion drawn from harsh reality of un presence allan duncan , a british development consultant who has worked in sudan for five years , said that the idea of living in a region with a peacekeeping force was very different from the reality ; something that has contributed to the sudanese attitude towards the un . " southern sudan was the first country i have worked in where there had been a peace-keeping force , " he told deutsche welle .
" i had always imagined that there would be lines of blue helmets out there in the street on a daily basis as a show of strength and force that would provide security and stability for the civil population within unstable environments . " " what actually happens is several thousand bangladeshi soldiers turn up at the airport one day and then go to their camp , the next time you see them is when they are leaving at the airport again .
in the five years that i worked in juba i could count on one hand the amount of un patrols that i saw in the street .
saying that , when small scale fighting did break out in the upper nile area over the past few years they did deploy troops between the factions and managed to dissipate the tension and flash points in the area . " un mission facing growing unease in southern sudan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its best efforts , the un mission has been criticized " unmis has a mixed reputation , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" it originally deployed slowly , and has been accused of responding slowly to outbreaks of violence in south sudan - although it did deploy troops to a number of at-risk areas last year , apparently deterring attacks .
south sudan remains volatile - over 400 civilians have been killed there this year alone - and there are reports that the population is dissatisfied with the un 's performance . " " the mission has also suffered from a shortage of civilian experts , and is constrained by south sudan 's lack of good roads and basic infrastructure .
these factors set limits on what the mission can achieve , " gowan added .
" the good news is that the un has now sent a new team of senior officials , headed by senior african diplomat haile menkerios , to take control of the situation .
menkerios is very well-respected , and has a clear grasp of the sudanese situation . " despite this , there is some concern that unmis may not be able to cope in its current form should the peace accord collapse and sudan is plunged once more into civil war .
the mission 's operating area is huge and it only has around 9,000 soldiers with the military primarily focused on monitoring the situation rather than protecting civilians directly . current mission status not strong enough to deal with war many experts believe that the mission will face very serious tests if the south votes for independence next year .
there is a high chance that this will lead to a wave of violence , and that un forces will come under pressure to react more forcefully than they have before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmis may not have enough troops to deal with conflict " the un may have to call for extra troops - either bringing in soldiers from its unamid mission in darfur , or having to ask another organization like the eu to send rapid reaction forces , " richard gowan said . " beyond any immediate crisis , there may be calls for the un to take on a more extensive role in building up a new state in south sudan - some experts are even talking about giving it the sort of executive mandate it had in kosovo and east timor .
for now , unmis has to try and head off violence around the referendum .
the odds are daunting , and unmis needs all the help it can get . " the scale of a potential crisis surrounding the independence referendum could also expose the un 's frailties elsewhere and could lead to further problems in the already crisis hit region of darfur .
" while the un was guilty of prioritizing darfur over south sudan in recent years - and so failed to see how dangerous the south was becoming - it now risks ignoring darfur 's ongoing crisis as it tries to save the south , " said gowan . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .
his three-day mideast trip is designed to coincide with chancellor angela merkel 's upcoming trip to the arabian peninsula , according to diplomatic officials. nrt / mz / acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news came as the irish airline announced plans for fresh investment in germany . germany 's federal court of justice ruled on thursday that ryanair put customers at a disadvantage by charging them a fee for using a credit or debit card to pay for tickets .
by charging the fee , the airline was thrusting on customers the costs of fulfilling its own legal obligations , the court , based in the southwestern town of karlsruhe , said .
germany 's leading consumer organization brought the case against the irish budget airline for charging a fee of between 1.50 and 4 euros -lrb- $ 1.90 - $ 5 -rrb- per passenger , saying ryanair did not offer consumers any way to pay for flights without paying an additional fee .
however , no fee was charged for paying with a visa electron card , a sister card to the visa debit card .
ryanair had argued that it was simply passing on to consumers the fee banks charge for credit card payments .
ryanair to create new jobs the court ruling came as ryanair announced plans to build a 25-million-euro crew training facility and maintenance hangar at frankfurt 's hahn airport .
the airline said the fresh investment would create up to 200 new jobs in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says it plans to invest 25 million euros in new facilities in germany ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary told a press conference in the city of mainz on thursday that , among other things , his airline intended to invest in two flight simulators and an airplane fuselage for training purposes .
he said the company was planning to rent a large maintenance hall that the airport will arrange for an investor to build at a cost of about 8 million euros .
o 'leary said construction work was due to begin in july .
starting in december , a major part of ryanair 's fleet would be serviced at hahn , he added .
about 1.5 million euros would be invested in a training center , located in an existing building , and the new facility would be in use as soon as august .
o 'leary added that ryanair intended to boost the number of planes it has based at hahn from 11 to 16 over the next five years , creating 350 new jobs .
the number of passengers was expected to rise from four million to six million a year .
hendrik hering , transport minister of the state of rhineland palatinate , where the airport is situated , said he was pleased with the decision .
he said the airline 's expansion plans were likely to attract other investors because it was now clear that ryanair intended to stay at hahn airport. rb / apb / dpa editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am afraid the americans do n't want any financial transaction tax , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper on saturday .
he said the feasibility of such a tax must be clarified at the g-20 conference of global economic powers in june , and that if it lacks support , " the german government will fight for a european solution . "
what must absolutely be avoided , he said , is " that we talk for three years and get nothing out of it . "
he added that new taxes on banks and a ban on short selling in financial markets also need serious multilateral negotiation .
bildunterschrift : the tax discussions come at a time of volatile financial markets coalition rift while chancellor angela merkel supports the transaction tax and her coalition government officially presented a unified stance last tuesday , divisions have appeared over the form of the tax between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her junior coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the split is on whether the government should levy a minimal , across-the-board " financial transaction tax " or a " financial activity tax " on profits , salaries and bonuses .
birgit homburger , parliamentary leader of the fdp , rejected the idea of a transaction tax , saying it would be passed down to ordinary savers .
she added that the activity tax was more likely to receive support from other global powers .
" i ask that we consider what has a chance internationally , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief steinmeier said the transaction tax was essential opposition dissent perhaps the strongest support for the transaction tax has come from the opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who abstained from a vote on a eurozone bailout fund on friday largely because merkel 's government has not sufficiently supported the tax .
party chief frank-walter steinmeier said the tax was essential , and that it would bring more money into state funds than the activity tax the government favors .
" we need this revenue to invest in the future and to secure our social welfare state , " he told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its external concrete slabs are n't any less gray than its neighbors , but the replica statue of liberty mounted above the entrance tells passers-by that its occupants must be of a special kind .
and indeed they are .
the residents are an international group of students from the town 's european viadrina university , who have come together to create the fforst community project .
they hail from germany , poland , portugal , france , russia , brazil and other nations .
and they look after a self-administered block , which they took over from the local housing association .
the association still owns the building , but has agreed to waive the rent .
" the room is full of different colors associated with the people who live here , " said mihal , a polish student , presenting the block 's club rooms in the basement .
" everybody in here wants to leave a mark that symbolizes something . "
in the mid-2000s , students at the university attended a seminar on how to put empty residential buildings in the city near the polish border to better use .
up to 6,000 apartments were left empty as thousands of locals left in pursuit of jobs elsewhere in the wake of german reunification .
the students explored what it would take to get a whole apartment block under their control and turn it into a self-administered unit .

although negotiations with the wowi housing company proved difficult at first , the deal struck in the end was that the students would pay for all utilities and would raise additional resources to organize cultural events for the whole town on a regular basis .
and that 's exactly what they 've been doing .
" everybody living here makes a contribution - often linked to the places they come from , " says tristan , a student from france .
" we all try to make our house shine as much as we can . "
among other things , the group members have organized international cultural evenings focusing on their various home countries .
but there have also been dance courses and parties as well as talks on important university-related subjects .
with the gift of hindsight , wowi has now swung round to viewing fforst as something extremely positive for the whole town .
frankfurt profits from the overwhelming media coverage the project has received .
the publicity was so welcome that financial considerations were pushed into the background .
" money is n't all that counts , and in this particular case it 's definitely not about making sure that all costs are covered by the occupants , " said doris kuehl , spokeswoman for wowi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wowi housing association has not regretted its approval pole position ?
the fact that living in the students ' home is so affordable plays into the hands of the project 's initiators , who also intended to create a place where neighboring german and polish students could get to know each other better than they did on the university campus .
outside the house , rents on the german side of the border are too high for polish students .
consequently , one of the first rules the students set in their house was that roommates must be from different countries to foster bilateral and international understanding .
the occupants believe this concept has worked marvelously , and some have taken this idea even further and celebrated wedding parties in the house .
meanwhile , the fforst home-sharing community has become a household name in town .
smoking the peace pipe with neighbors this is not to say that building good relations with everyone has always been plain sailing .
students tend to go to bed late , and sometimes they can get quite loud .
friction with neighbors seems inevitable , and indeed locals occasionally expressed resentment towards the new occupants , but now the buzzword is peaceful coexistence .
" we definitely look for compromises , and we invite the neighbors to our joint events , " said mihal from poland .
" or we give them chocolates if we 've been too loud . "
mihal adds that the creation of such a lively community should have symbolic value for a town that many are still leaving .
" we want to show that eastern germans can stay in such a region and that it 's up to them to change it for the better and turn it into an area worth living in , " he told deutsche welle .

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .
his three-day mideast trip is designed to coincide with chancellor angela merkel 's upcoming trip to the arabian peninsula , according to diplomatic officials. nrt / mz / acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundeswehr soldiers are part of the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , which is charged with preventing weapons smuggling by the radical islamist group hezbollah .
the international mission has run in its current capacity since 2006 , and german troops are scheduled to leave at the end of june .
earlier on saturday , westerwelle held a meeting with lebanese prime minister saad hariri in beirut .
there , he told reporters that peace in the middle east is important for the entire world , not just to those in the region .
" conflicts nowadays are international , and that is why we feel it is our responsibility to support stability and peace , " said westerwelle .
during his talks with westerwelle , hariri made it clear that he hoped the unifil mission would be extended .
he added that security , peace and stability in the region were in the best interests of germany .
peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met lebanese prime minister hariri on friday later westerwelle traveled to cairo to meet with the general secretary of the arab league , amr moussa , as well his egyptian counterpart ahmed aboul gheit .
the german politician stressed the need for direct israeli-palestinian talks , adding that " durable peace can only be achieved in the region in a two-state solution . " westerwelle is scheduled to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak on sunday .
egypt is considered a key actor in the middle east and an important partner in the middle east peace process that has worked towards the initiation of the israeli-palestinian proximity talks , the german foreign ministry said on its website .
nefertiti spat during talks with egyptian foreign minister abul-gheit the two politicians also discussed ownership of the bust of ancient egyptian queen nefertiti .
german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased in 1913 .
" we will come to an agreement that will satisfy both sides , " abul-gheit said .
westerwelle argued that the bust was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle will also visit syria and jordan .
his three-day mideast trip is designed to coincide with chancellor angela merkel 's upcoming trip to the arabian peninsula , according to diplomatic officials. nrt / mz / acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
