the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .

however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .

michael schumacher , meanwhile , made enemies with rubens barrichello , pushing him off the track . australian racer mark webber overtook his teammate , german pole position favorite sebastian vettel , at sunday 's hungarian grand prix in budapest , grabbing back the formula one championship lead from lewis hamilton and taking the lead for red bull .
mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel had been the bookmakers ' favorite angrily shaking his fist at officials , the 23-year-old came in third behind ferrari 's fernando alonso , further frustrated by a radio problem that left him unable to understand what mistake he had made .
' a gift ' webber celebrated the win he referred to as " a gift " from vettel .
" he was on pole and was leading the first stint and unless he makes a mistake or has a problem , it is probably going to be his race ... but this is racing and sometimes it happens .
most of my other victories have n't been gifted to me , " webber said .
vettel said he was " obviously disappointed " at losing what should have been a " walk in the park . "
renault 's rookie vitaly petrov of russia came in fifth after ferrari 's felipe massa , who came back to budapest after suffering a nearly-fatal accident in the 2009 hungarian grand prix .
schumacher makes enemies meanwhile , german comeback racer michael schumacher earned enemies in budapest in a maneuver his former ferrari teammate rubens barrichello called the most dangerous ever used against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : webber called the win a " gift " " if michael wants to go to heaven - in the event that he is going to heaven - then i do n't really care .
but i do n't want to go before him , " said barrichello , who demanded that action be taken against schumacher .
barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .
" but it 's clear that i wanted to make life for him as difficult as possible . "

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .

a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .

michael schumacher , meanwhile , made enemies with rubens barrichello , pushing him off the track . australian racer mark webber overtook his teammate , german pole position favorite sebastian vettel , at sunday 's hungarian grand prix in budapest , grabbing back the formula one championship lead from lewis hamilton and taking the lead for red bull .
mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel had been the bookmakers ' favorite angrily shaking his fist at officials , the 23-year-old came in third behind ferrari 's fernando alonso , further frustrated by a radio problem that left him unable to understand what mistake he had made .
' a gift ' webber celebrated the win he referred to as " a gift " from vettel .
" he was on pole and was leading the first stint and unless he makes a mistake or has a problem , it is probably going to be his race ... but this is racing and sometimes it happens .
most of my other victories have n't been gifted to me , " webber said .
vettel said he was " obviously disappointed " at losing what should have been a " walk in the park . "
renault 's rookie vitaly petrov of russia came in fifth after ferrari 's felipe massa , who came back to budapest after suffering a nearly-fatal accident in the 2009 hungarian grand prix .
schumacher makes enemies meanwhile , german comeback racer michael schumacher earned enemies in budapest in a maneuver his former ferrari teammate rubens barrichello called the most dangerous ever used against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : webber called the win a " gift " " if michael wants to go to heaven - in the event that he is going to heaven - then i do n't really care .
but i do n't want to go before him , " said barrichello , who demanded that action be taken against schumacher .
barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .
" but it 's clear that i wanted to make life for him as difficult as possible . "

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

germany is among 108 countries who have signed up , but there are still some major military powers missing from the list . an international convention banning cluster bombs came into force on sunday , august 1 .
so far over 100 countries have signed the treaty , and 38 countries , including germany , have ratified it .
" this is a milestone on the path to a universal ban of inhumane weapons .
and it ’ s an unmistakeable sign that arms reduction is possible , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said .
" it 's also an encouragement to strive for arms reduction in other fields , " he added .
westerwelle also called on all those countries that have n't ratified the treaty yet , to " join the ban on cluster bombs as soon as possible . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said the swift entry into force of the new convention highlights " the world 's collective revulsion at these abhorrent weapons . "
indiscriminate weapons cluster bombs are considered to be particularly insidious .
they are packed by the hundreds into artillery shells , or missiles and can scatter over vast areas .
tens of thousands have died as a result of unexploded devices , which can remain hidden for years .
they often go off only when they are discovered by children or farmers in fields .
according to handicap international , 98 percent of those who are injured by cluster bombs are civilians , some decades after war has ended .
bildunterschrift : various types of cluster bomb were used by israel in lebanon the new convention outlaws the use , development , production , storage and distribution of cluster bombs .
germany says it will destroy its cluster bomb stock by 2015 .
austria and spain have already paved the way .
to date the bombs have been used in over 20 countries .
during the vietnam war 400,000 cluster bombs were dropped on laos alone .
the treaty also means that countries will have to help victims to deal with the medical and psychological effects of the weapons .
not everyone has signed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many victims are children who discover the unexploded bombs whilst playing however , major military powers , notably the us , russia and china are not signatories of the convention .
but according to paul vermeulen of handicap international , these countries can not ignore such strong international condemnation of cluster bombs .
" a convention like this stigmatises a whole style of weaponry and that 's incredibly powerful .
we observe that all states have changed their attitudes , " he said .
even though the ban is now in force , it will be decades before some countries are free of cluster bombs .
the first conference for those who have signed the convention will take place in laos in november .
there the countries will discuss an action plan , to ensure the treaty is put into force effectively .

it consists of a vast series of dams , canals , water wheels and underground water chambers and originally provided energy for mining .
the earliest features date from the 12th century and were built by cistercian monks .
the success of mining in the region contributed to economic prosperity in the middle ages and beyond .
will this put the region on the map ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its picturesque ponds and lakes , the region already attracts thousands of tourists the nearby rammelsberg mines and the ancient town of goslar were awarded world heritage status in 1992 .
the new award extends recognition to the water system that served the area .
whilst unesco status is seen as a badge of honour for the region , it remains to be seen whether it will boost tourism .
the waterways are already a popular holiday destination .
" it could affect tourism , but i do n't know how it would affect it because harz is already a tourist region , " said dieter offenhauser , deputy secretary general of the german unesco commission .
still in use today this vast system of caves , ponds and channels is in part still functioning , another thing that makes it unique .
it requires millions of euros of investment by the regional authorities .
maintaing and preserving the site is " a big responsibility , " according to dieter offenhauser .
to qualify for the world heritage list the historic monuments have to be managed and preserved appropriately .
the upper harz water management system will become germany 's 34th unesco world heritage site ; there are 890 such sites in the world .

athens had deployed military vehicles to restore fuel supplies to a crippled country . greek truckers ended their seven-day strike sunday , handing a victory to athens ' push for freight sector reform .
" the general assembly of truck federations decided , with a marginal majority , to end the strike , " truckers ' union head george tzortzatos told reporters on sunday .
truckers are now expected to enter talks with athens about opening up their closed-shop profession .
armed forces had been working around the clock from friday to supply airports , power plants and hospitals after the strike left the country largely crippled and its motorways littered with abandoned cars .
opening up road freight industry greece 's 33,000 protesting truck and fuel-tanker owners walked off the job to protest against the creation of new trucking licenses after the government stopped issuing new permits 40 years ago .
truckers said the plan was unfair to existing operators , as it would devalue their initial investment ; many have paid up to 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 391,550 -rrb- to buy their permits , and would not be able to recoup this amount when they retire and sell off their permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel shortages hit during the busy summer tourist season athens says the move will help liberalize the freight sector and open the industry to more competition by september , a key part of the reforms outlined in the 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 144 billion -rrb- european union / international monetary fund bailout for the debt-ridden country .
financial analysts have stressed that opening up greece 's closed professions , which also include architecture and law , is essential to revitalizing the country 's economy .
" it is even more important than fiscal stabilization because it is the operation of the market which is hindered , " said yannis stournaras of the athens-based iobe think tank .
" when these markets open , gdp will be much higher , " he added .
consequences linger until the strike was called off , truckers had been risking criminal prosecution and a loss of license for defying a government back-to-work order issued on wednesday businesses , meanwhile , reported that the strike had damaged their livelihood and dealt further blows to greece 's image abroad .
tourism , which accounts for nearly a fifth of greece 's recession-hit economy , was also hit hard .
with an estimated hundreds of thousands of tourists stranded in greece , many more chose to cancel their summer vacation plans .

michael schumacher , meanwhile , made enemies with rubens barrichello , pushing him off the track . australian racer mark webber overtook his teammate , german pole position favorite sebastian vettel , at sunday 's hungarian grand prix in budapest , grabbing back the formula one championship lead from lewis hamilton and taking the lead for red bull .
mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel had been the bookmakers ' favorite angrily shaking his fist at officials , the 23-year-old came in third behind ferrari 's fernando alonso , further frustrated by a radio problem that left him unable to understand what mistake he had made .
' a gift ' webber celebrated the win he referred to as " a gift " from vettel .
" he was on pole and was leading the first stint and unless he makes a mistake or has a problem , it is probably going to be his race ... but this is racing and sometimes it happens .
most of my other victories have n't been gifted to me , " webber said .
vettel said he was " obviously disappointed " at losing what should have been a " walk in the park . "
renault 's rookie vitaly petrov of russia came in fifth after ferrari 's felipe massa , who came back to budapest after suffering a nearly-fatal accident in the 2009 hungarian grand prix .
schumacher makes enemies meanwhile , german comeback racer michael schumacher earned enemies in budapest in a maneuver his former ferrari teammate rubens barrichello called the most dangerous ever used against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : webber called the win a " gift " " if michael wants to go to heaven - in the event that he is going to heaven - then i do n't really care .
but i do n't want to go before him , " said barrichello , who demanded that action be taken against schumacher .
barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .
" but it 's clear that i wanted to make life for him as difficult as possible . "

the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .

barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .

germany is among 108 countries who have signed up , but there are still some major military powers missing from the list . an international convention banning cluster bombs came into force on sunday , august 1 .
so far over 100 countries have signed the treaty , and 38 countries , including germany , have ratified it .
" this is a milestone on the path to a universal ban of inhumane weapons .
and it ’ s an unmistakeable sign that arms reduction is possible , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said .
" it 's also an encouragement to strive for arms reduction in other fields , " he added .
westerwelle also called on all those countries that have n't ratified the treaty yet , to " join the ban on cluster bombs as soon as possible . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said the swift entry into force of the new convention highlights " the world 's collective revulsion at these abhorrent weapons . "
indiscriminate weapons cluster bombs are considered to be particularly insidious .
they are packed by the hundreds into artillery shells , or missiles and can scatter over vast areas .
tens of thousands have died as a result of unexploded devices , which can remain hidden for years .
they often go off only when they are discovered by children or farmers in fields .
according to handicap international , 98 percent of those who are injured by cluster bombs are civilians , some decades after war has ended .
bildunterschrift : various types of cluster bomb were used by israel in lebanon the new convention outlaws the use , development , production , storage and distribution of cluster bombs .
germany says it will destroy its cluster bomb stock by 2015 .
austria and spain have already paved the way .
to date the bombs have been used in over 20 countries .
during the vietnam war 400,000 cluster bombs were dropped on laos alone .
the treaty also means that countries will have to help victims to deal with the medical and psychological effects of the weapons .
not everyone has signed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many victims are children who discover the unexploded bombs whilst playing however , major military powers , notably the us , russia and china are not signatories of the convention .
but according to paul vermeulen of handicap international , these countries can not ignore such strong international condemnation of cluster bombs .
" a convention like this stigmatises a whole style of weaponry and that 's incredibly powerful .
we observe that all states have changed their attitudes , " he said .
even though the ban is now in force , it will be decades before some countries are free of cluster bombs .
the first conference for those who have signed the convention will take place in laos in november .
there the countries will discuss an action plan , to ensure the treaty is put into force effectively .

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .

the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

michael schumacher , meanwhile , made enemies with rubens barrichello , pushing him off the track . australian racer mark webber overtook his teammate , german pole position favorite sebastian vettel , at sunday 's hungarian grand prix in budapest , grabbing back the formula one championship lead from lewis hamilton and taking the lead for red bull .
mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel had been the bookmakers ' favorite angrily shaking his fist at officials , the 23-year-old came in third behind ferrari 's fernando alonso , further frustrated by a radio problem that left him unable to understand what mistake he had made .
' a gift ' webber celebrated the win he referred to as " a gift " from vettel .
" he was on pole and was leading the first stint and unless he makes a mistake or has a problem , it is probably going to be his race ... but this is racing and sometimes it happens .
most of my other victories have n't been gifted to me , " webber said .
vettel said he was " obviously disappointed " at losing what should have been a " walk in the park . "
renault 's rookie vitaly petrov of russia came in fifth after ferrari 's felipe massa , who came back to budapest after suffering a nearly-fatal accident in the 2009 hungarian grand prix .
schumacher makes enemies meanwhile , german comeback racer michael schumacher earned enemies in budapest in a maneuver his former ferrari teammate rubens barrichello called the most dangerous ever used against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : webber called the win a " gift " " if michael wants to go to heaven - in the event that he is going to heaven - then i do n't really care .
but i do n't want to go before him , " said barrichello , who demanded that action be taken against schumacher .
barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .
" but it 's clear that i wanted to make life for him as difficult as possible . "

" the general assembly of truck federations decided , with a marginal majority , to end the strike , " truckers ' union head george tzortzatos told reporters on sunday .
truckers are now expected to enter talks with athens about opening up their closed-shop profession .

opening up road freight industry greece 's 33,000 protesting truck and fuel-tanker owners walked off the job to protest against the creation of new trucking licenses after the government stopped issuing new permits 40 years ago .
truckers said the plan was unfair to existing operators , as it would devalue their initial investment ; many have paid up to 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 391,550 -rrb- to buy their permits , and would not be able to recoup this amount when they retire and sell off their permit .

" it is even more important than fiscal stabilization because it is the operation of the market which is hindered , " said yannis stournaras of the athens-based iobe think tank .

but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

athens had deployed military vehicles to restore fuel supplies to a crippled country . greek truckers ended their seven-day strike sunday , handing a victory to athens ' push for freight sector reform .
" the general assembly of truck federations decided , with a marginal majority , to end the strike , " truckers ' union head george tzortzatos told reporters on sunday .
truckers are now expected to enter talks with athens about opening up their closed-shop profession .
armed forces had been working around the clock from friday to supply airports , power plants and hospitals after the strike left the country largely crippled and its motorways littered with abandoned cars .
opening up road freight industry greece 's 33,000 protesting truck and fuel-tanker owners walked off the job to protest against the creation of new trucking licenses after the government stopped issuing new permits 40 years ago .
truckers said the plan was unfair to existing operators , as it would devalue their initial investment ; many have paid up to 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 391,550 -rrb- to buy their permits , and would not be able to recoup this amount when they retire and sell off their permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel shortages hit during the busy summer tourist season athens says the move will help liberalize the freight sector and open the industry to more competition by september , a key part of the reforms outlined in the 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 144 billion -rrb- european union / international monetary fund bailout for the debt-ridden country .
financial analysts have stressed that opening up greece 's closed professions , which also include architecture and law , is essential to revitalizing the country 's economy .
" it is even more important than fiscal stabilization because it is the operation of the market which is hindered , " said yannis stournaras of the athens-based iobe think tank .
" when these markets open , gdp will be much higher , " he added .
consequences linger until the strike was called off , truckers had been risking criminal prosecution and a loss of license for defying a government back-to-work order issued on wednesday businesses , meanwhile , reported that the strike had damaged their livelihood and dealt further blows to greece 's image abroad .
tourism , which accounts for nearly a fifth of greece 's recession-hit economy , was also hit hard .
with an estimated hundreds of thousands of tourists stranded in greece , many more chose to cancel their summer vacation plans .

michael schumacher , meanwhile , made enemies with rubens barrichello , pushing him off the track . australian racer mark webber overtook his teammate , german pole position favorite sebastian vettel , at sunday 's hungarian grand prix in budapest , grabbing back the formula one championship lead from lewis hamilton and taking the lead for red bull .
mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel had been the bookmakers ' favorite angrily shaking his fist at officials , the 23-year-old came in third behind ferrari 's fernando alonso , further frustrated by a radio problem that left him unable to understand what mistake he had made .
' a gift ' webber celebrated the win he referred to as " a gift " from vettel .
" he was on pole and was leading the first stint and unless he makes a mistake or has a problem , it is probably going to be his race ... but this is racing and sometimes it happens .
most of my other victories have n't been gifted to me , " webber said .
vettel said he was " obviously disappointed " at losing what should have been a " walk in the park . "
renault 's rookie vitaly petrov of russia came in fifth after ferrari 's felipe massa , who came back to budapest after suffering a nearly-fatal accident in the 2009 hungarian grand prix .
schumacher makes enemies meanwhile , german comeback racer michael schumacher earned enemies in budapest in a maneuver his former ferrari teammate rubens barrichello called the most dangerous ever used against him .

but i do n't want to go before him , " said barrichello , who demanded that action be taken against schumacher .
barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .
" but it 's clear that i wanted to make life for him as difficult as possible . "

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the un cultural committee announced the news at a conference in brazil on sunday . the unesco committee has declared an 850-year-old water management system in the upper harz region of germany as a world heritage site .
at a conference in brasília , brazil the united nations cultural organization discussed applications for world heritage status for 32 new sites .
according to unesco spokesperson , sue williams , the 21 experts at the conference decided unanimously to put the german water system on the list of world heritage sites .
" there 's no comparable system anywhere , " according to professor reinhard roseneck , responsible for environmental heritage in the lower saxony region , who helped prepare the german application .
the water management system is one of the biggest surviving pre-industrial energy suppliers .
it consists of a vast series of dams , canals , water wheels and underground water chambers and originally provided energy for mining .
the earliest features date from the 12th century and were built by cistercian monks .
the success of mining in the region contributed to economic prosperity in the middle ages and beyond .
will this put the region on the map ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its picturesque ponds and lakes , the region already attracts thousands of tourists the nearby rammelsberg mines and the ancient town of goslar were awarded world heritage status in 1992 .
the new award extends recognition to the water system that served the area .
whilst unesco status is seen as a badge of honour for the region , it remains to be seen whether it will boost tourism .
the waterways are already a popular holiday destination .
" it could affect tourism , but i do n't know how it would affect it because harz is already a tourist region , " said dieter offenhauser , deputy secretary general of the german unesco commission .
still in use today this vast system of caves , ponds and channels is in part still functioning , another thing that makes it unique .
it requires millions of euros of investment by the regional authorities .
maintaing and preserving the site is " a big responsibility , " according to dieter offenhauser .
to qualify for the world heritage list the historic monuments have to be managed and preserved appropriately .
the upper harz water management system will become germany 's 34th unesco world heritage site ; there are 890 such sites in the world .

mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .

barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the un cultural committee announced the news at a conference in brazil on sunday . the unesco committee has declared an 850-year-old water management system in the upper harz region of germany as a world heritage site .
at a conference in brasília , brazil the united nations cultural organization discussed applications for world heritage status for 32 new sites .
according to unesco spokesperson , sue williams , the 21 experts at the conference decided unanimously to put the german water system on the list of world heritage sites .
" there 's no comparable system anywhere , " according to professor reinhard roseneck , responsible for environmental heritage in the lower saxony region , who helped prepare the german application .
the water management system is one of the biggest surviving pre-industrial energy suppliers .
it consists of a vast series of dams , canals , water wheels and underground water chambers and originally provided energy for mining .
the earliest features date from the 12th century and were built by cistercian monks .
the success of mining in the region contributed to economic prosperity in the middle ages and beyond .
will this put the region on the map ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its picturesque ponds and lakes , the region already attracts thousands of tourists the nearby rammelsberg mines and the ancient town of goslar were awarded world heritage status in 1992 .
the new award extends recognition to the water system that served the area .
whilst unesco status is seen as a badge of honour for the region , it remains to be seen whether it will boost tourism .
the waterways are already a popular holiday destination .
" it could affect tourism , but i do n't know how it would affect it because harz is already a tourist region , " said dieter offenhauser , deputy secretary general of the german unesco commission .
still in use today this vast system of caves , ponds and channels is in part still functioning , another thing that makes it unique .
it requires millions of euros of investment by the regional authorities .
maintaing and preserving the site is " a big responsibility , " according to dieter offenhauser .
to qualify for the world heritage list the historic monuments have to be managed and preserved appropriately .
the upper harz water management system will become germany 's 34th unesco world heritage site ; there are 890 such sites in the world .

they 're connected by a common enthusiasm for finding and presenting the right story . since there is little money to be earned in the field of documentary film production , most people venture into it for the passion .
that is what documentary filmmakers magdalena hutter , bettina braun and lisa glahn have in common - and what keeps them going .
as women in the business , they 're still in the minority and often get less than a fair share of available funding . in an often lonely industry , teamwork is essential to them and is the basis of the cologne-based organization , ladoc - a sort of support group for documentary filmmakers who share the same passion . " what i like most about documentary making is that you can definitely shape very strongly what you make , it 's not like you just record what 's there , " hutter told deutsche welle . for her latest project , she and another german filmmaker were invited to work with a film institute in montreal .
they were given just three weeks to find and shoot a story . " we just roamed the streets and looked for things that made an impression on us , " said hutter , adding that co-directing is very complicated and intimate .

" they were living in a little flat , with five or six women in two rooms , " said glahn , " and i was there and i felt at home , so in this poverty they started to integrate me and immediately there was a friendship . " those kind of human connections are what drive documentary filmmakers ' passion for their trade . glahn 's ladoc colleague bettina braun recently made a film that focuses on immigrant families who were born and raised in cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documentary making is sometimes a gritty business " what drew me to these people is this question of belonging , identity , " said braun .

they 're connected by a common enthusiasm for finding and presenting the right story . since there is little money to be earned in the field of documentary film production , most people venture into it for the passion .
that is what documentary filmmakers magdalena hutter , bettina braun and lisa glahn have in common - and what keeps them going .
as women in the business , they 're still in the minority and often get less than a fair share of available funding . in an often lonely industry , teamwork is essential to them and is the basis of the cologne-based organization , ladoc - a sort of support group for documentary filmmakers who share the same passion . " what i like most about documentary making is that you can definitely shape very strongly what you make , it 's not like you just record what 's there , " hutter told deutsche welle . for her latest project , she and another german filmmaker were invited to work with a film institute in montreal .
they were given just three weeks to find and shoot a story . " we just roamed the streets and looked for things that made an impression on us , " said hutter , adding that co-directing is very complicated and intimate .
she 's used to working alone , which is common for documentary filmmakers . bildunterschrift : a scene from bettina braun 's documentary " was lebst du ? "
what impressed them in montreal reflects something much deeper than what seems to be going on in germany : the question of how immigration affects a whole society 's identity . " people deal with immigration in a way that just does n't happen in europe , " she said , " -lsb- canadian are -rsb- very open , really want people to come .
there ’ s a diversity there that we found very impressive . " deep human connections director lisa glahn , another member of ladoc , also recently made a film in 2001 that dealt with immigration ; " black odyssey " sheds light on the plight of nigerian women who have been trafficked to italy to work as prostitutes . " they were living in a little flat , with five or six women in two rooms , " said glahn , " and i was there and i felt at home , so in this poverty they started to integrate me and immediately there was a friendship . " those kind of human connections are what drive documentary filmmakers ' passion for their trade . glahn 's ladoc colleague bettina braun recently made a film that focuses on immigrant families who were born and raised in cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documentary making is sometimes a gritty business " what drew me to these people is this question of belonging , identity , " said braun .
" and then there were other things that drew me to them : a sense of humor , and maybe also certain values in life . " it took her over a year to sell the film - a time when she likely relied on her ladoc colleagues for support and connections . network for a niche group the group was founded seven years ago and now includes more than 24 women working in the documentary film industry in cologne . ladoc does not have a legal structure , staff , hierarchy or its own funding , but they invite guest lecturers and participate together in film festivals .

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .
" we need more courage to make a real change in the field of data protection in the fight against terror . "

germany is among 108 countries who have signed up , but there are still some major military powers missing from the list . an international convention banning cluster bombs came into force on sunday , august 1 .
so far over 100 countries have signed the treaty , and 38 countries , including germany , have ratified it .
" this is a milestone on the path to a universal ban of inhumane weapons .
and it ’ s an unmistakeable sign that arms reduction is possible , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said .
" it 's also an encouragement to strive for arms reduction in other fields , " he added .
westerwelle also called on all those countries that have n't ratified the treaty yet , to " join the ban on cluster bombs as soon as possible . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said the swift entry into force of the new convention highlights " the world 's collective revulsion at these abhorrent weapons . "
indiscriminate weapons cluster bombs are considered to be particularly insidious .
they are packed by the hundreds into artillery shells , or missiles and can scatter over vast areas .
tens of thousands have died as a result of unexploded devices , which can remain hidden for years .
they often go off only when they are discovered by children or farmers in fields .
according to handicap international , 98 percent of those who are injured by cluster bombs are civilians , some decades after war has ended .
bildunterschrift : various types of cluster bomb were used by israel in lebanon the new convention outlaws the use , development , production , storage and distribution of cluster bombs .
germany says it will destroy its cluster bomb stock by 2015 .
austria and spain have already paved the way .
to date the bombs have been used in over 20 countries .
during the vietnam war 400,000 cluster bombs were dropped on laos alone .
the treaty also means that countries will have to help victims to deal with the medical and psychological effects of the weapons .
not everyone has signed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many victims are children who discover the unexploded bombs whilst playing however , major military powers , notably the us , russia and china are not signatories of the convention .
but according to paul vermeulen of handicap international , these countries can not ignore such strong international condemnation of cluster bombs .
" a convention like this stigmatises a whole style of weaponry and that 's incredibly powerful .
we observe that all states have changed their attitudes , " he said .
even though the ban is now in force , it will be decades before some countries are free of cluster bombs .
the first conference for those who have signed the convention will take place in laos in november .
there the countries will discuss an action plan , to ensure the treaty is put into force effectively .

they 're connected by a common enthusiasm for finding and presenting the right story . since there is little money to be earned in the field of documentary film production , most people venture into it for the passion .
that is what documentary filmmakers magdalena hutter , bettina braun and lisa glahn have in common - and what keeps them going .
as women in the business , they 're still in the minority and often get less than a fair share of available funding . in an often lonely industry , teamwork is essential to them and is the basis of the cologne-based organization , ladoc - a sort of support group for documentary filmmakers who share the same passion . " what i like most about documentary making is that you can definitely shape very strongly what you make , it 's not like you just record what 's there , " hutter told deutsche welle . for her latest project , she and another german filmmaker were invited to work with a film institute in montreal .
they were given just three weeks to find and shoot a story . " we just roamed the streets and looked for things that made an impression on us , " said hutter , adding that co-directing is very complicated and intimate .

" they were living in a little flat , with five or six women in two rooms , " said glahn , " and i was there and i felt at home , so in this poverty they started to integrate me and immediately there was a friendship . " those kind of human connections are what drive documentary filmmakers ' passion for their trade . glahn 's ladoc colleague bettina braun recently made a film that focuses on immigrant families who were born and raised in cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documentary making is sometimes a gritty business " what drew me to these people is this question of belonging , identity , " said braun .

" it took her over a year to sell the film - a time when she likely relied on her ladoc colleagues for support and connections . network for a niche group the group was founded seven years ago and now includes more than 24 women working in the documentary film industry in cologne . ladoc does not have a legal structure , staff , hierarchy or its own funding , but they invite guest lecturers and participate together in film festivals .
they also help each other out whenever possible with research , production assistance , legal counsel and connections to broadcasters and sponsors . as a student for the past five years , hutter has benefited from access to equipment and support offered by her film schools .

they 're connected by a common enthusiasm for finding and presenting the right story . since there is little money to be earned in the field of documentary film production , most people venture into it for the passion .
that is what documentary filmmakers magdalena hutter , bettina braun and lisa glahn have in common - and what keeps them going .
as women in the business , they 're still in the minority and often get less than a fair share of available funding . in an often lonely industry , teamwork is essential to them and is the basis of the cologne-based organization , ladoc - a sort of support group for documentary filmmakers who share the same passion . " what i like most about documentary making is that you can definitely shape very strongly what you make , it 's not like you just record what 's there , " hutter told deutsche welle . for her latest project , she and another german filmmaker were invited to work with a film institute in montreal .
they were given just three weeks to find and shoot a story . " we just roamed the streets and looked for things that made an impression on us , " said hutter , adding that co-directing is very complicated and intimate .
she 's used to working alone , which is common for documentary filmmakers . bildunterschrift : a scene from bettina braun 's documentary " was lebst du ? "
what impressed them in montreal reflects something much deeper than what seems to be going on in germany : the question of how immigration affects a whole society 's identity .

" they were living in a little flat , with five or six women in two rooms , " said glahn , " and i was there and i felt at home , so in this poverty they started to integrate me and immediately there was a friendship . " those kind of human connections are what drive documentary filmmakers ' passion for their trade . glahn 's ladoc colleague bettina braun recently made a film that focuses on immigrant families who were born and raised in cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documentary making is sometimes a gritty business " what drew me to these people is this question of belonging , identity , " said braun .

they also help each other out whenever possible with research , production assistance , legal counsel and connections to broadcasters and sponsors . as a student for the past five years , hutter has benefited from access to equipment and support offered by her film schools .

the un cultural committee announced the news at a conference in brazil on sunday . the unesco committee has declared an 850-year-old water management system in the upper harz region of germany as a world heritage site .
at a conference in brasília , brazil the united nations cultural organization discussed applications for world heritage status for 32 new sites .
according to unesco spokesperson , sue williams , the 21 experts at the conference decided unanimously to put the german water system on the list of world heritage sites .
" there 's no comparable system anywhere , " according to professor reinhard roseneck , responsible for environmental heritage in the lower saxony region , who helped prepare the german application .
the water management system is one of the biggest surviving pre-industrial energy suppliers .
it consists of a vast series of dams , canals , water wheels and underground water chambers and originally provided energy for mining .
the earliest features date from the 12th century and were built by cistercian monks .
the success of mining in the region contributed to economic prosperity in the middle ages and beyond .
will this put the region on the map ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its picturesque ponds and lakes , the region already attracts thousands of tourists the nearby rammelsberg mines and the ancient town of goslar were awarded world heritage status in 1992 .
the new award extends recognition to the water system that served the area .
whilst unesco status is seen as a badge of honour for the region , it remains to be seen whether it will boost tourism .
the waterways are already a popular holiday destination .
" it could affect tourism , but i do n't know how it would affect it because harz is already a tourist region , " said dieter offenhauser , deputy secretary general of the german unesco commission .
still in use today this vast system of caves , ponds and channels is in part still functioning , another thing that makes it unique .
it requires millions of euros of investment by the regional authorities .
maintaing and preserving the site is " a big responsibility , " according to dieter offenhauser .
to qualify for the world heritage list the historic monuments have to be managed and preserved appropriately .
the upper harz water management system will become germany 's 34th unesco world heritage site ; there are 890 such sites in the world .

michael schumacher , meanwhile , made enemies with rubens barrichello , pushing him off the track . australian racer mark webber overtook his teammate , german pole position favorite sebastian vettel , at sunday 's hungarian grand prix in budapest , grabbing back the formula one championship lead from lewis hamilton and taking the lead for red bull .
mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel had been the bookmakers ' favorite angrily shaking his fist at officials , the 23-year-old came in third behind ferrari 's fernando alonso , further frustrated by a radio problem that left him unable to understand what mistake he had made .
' a gift ' webber celebrated the win he referred to as " a gift " from vettel .
" he was on pole and was leading the first stint and unless he makes a mistake or has a problem , it is probably going to be his race ... but this is racing and sometimes it happens .
most of my other victories have n't been gifted to me , " webber said .
vettel said he was " obviously disappointed " at losing what should have been a " walk in the park . "
renault 's rookie vitaly petrov of russia came in fifth after ferrari 's felipe massa , who came back to budapest after suffering a nearly-fatal accident in the 2009 hungarian grand prix .
schumacher makes enemies meanwhile , german comeback racer michael schumacher earned enemies in budapest in a maneuver his former ferrari teammate rubens barrichello called the most dangerous ever used against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : webber called the win a " gift " " if michael wants to go to heaven - in the event that he is going to heaven - then i do n't really care .
but i do n't want to go before him , " said barrichello , who demanded that action be taken against schumacher .
barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .
" but it 's clear that i wanted to make life for him as difficult as possible . "

michael schumacher , meanwhile , made enemies with rubens barrichello , pushing him off the track . australian racer mark webber overtook his teammate , german pole position favorite sebastian vettel , at sunday 's hungarian grand prix in budapest , grabbing back the formula one championship lead from lewis hamilton and taking the lead for red bull .
mclaren 's hamilton meanwhile retired with a gearbox failure , falling to second overall , four points adrift .
the briton had led the championship since deposing webber in canada in june .
vettel , who had started on pole position for the seventh time in 12 races , pulled away at almost a second a lap but was shaken when the safety car was released at the 15th of 70 laps to clean up tire debris .
vettel became trapped in third when he was handed a penalty for failing to keep the correct distance in second place behind the clean-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel had been the bookmakers ' favorite angrily shaking his fist at officials , the 23-year-old came in third behind ferrari 's fernando alonso , further frustrated by a radio problem that left him unable to understand what mistake he had made .
' a gift ' webber celebrated the win he referred to as " a gift " from vettel .
" he was on pole and was leading the first stint and unless he makes a mistake or has a problem , it is probably going to be his race ... but this is racing and sometimes it happens .
most of my other victories have n't been gifted to me , " webber said .
vettel said he was " obviously disappointed " at losing what should have been a " walk in the park . "
renault 's rookie vitaly petrov of russia came in fifth after ferrari 's felipe massa , who came back to budapest after suffering a nearly-fatal accident in the 2009 hungarian grand prix .
schumacher makes enemies meanwhile , german comeback racer michael schumacher earned enemies in budapest in a maneuver his former ferrari teammate rubens barrichello called the most dangerous ever used against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : webber called the win a " gift " " if michael wants to go to heaven - in the event that he is going to heaven - then i do n't really care .
but i do n't want to go before him , " said barrichello , who demanded that action be taken against schumacher .
barrichello managed to pull ahead of schumacher , finishing in 10th place despite schumacher allegedly pushing him within millimeters of the wall and off the track .
stewards ruled that schumacher had " illegitimately impeded " the brazilian racer .
" as far as i was concerned there was enough room for him to get through there , " schumacher responded .
" but it 's clear that i wanted to make life for him as difficult as possible . "

the so-called swift agreement gives us authorities access to information about bank transfers which go through the belgian-based financial messaging company .
swift has around 80 percent of the electronic transfer market .
the company enables transactions between around 8,000 banks in 200 countries .
the us will be able to demand information about transfers that take place between the european union and the rest of the world .
however , because swift does not have the structures in place to filter the information , they will send data in bulk packages to the us .
german interior minister thomas de maizière said the controversial agreement between the eu and the usa was an important step in the international fight against terror .
privacy concerns however , some members of the european parliament are worried that this could infringe the privacy of innocent individuals .
the european parliament has worked to build safeguards into the system to prevent any misuse of data .
the issue has been debated since 2006 , and at various stages meps have put pressure on the council of ministers for more parliamentary control and increased personal data protection .
the green mep jan philipp albrecht is worried that the agreement reached between the eu and the us will be " a step backwards for negotiations for a comprehensive privacy rights in international security operations . "
" it 's a real shame that the eu is weakening their influence over the usa with this agreement , " albrecht said .

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the withdrawal is seen as a blow for the nato-led coalition , who had wanted the dutch to stay on . dutch troops have left afghanistan after four years , handing over control to an american-led group of soldiers .
just under 2,000 dutch soldiers had been deployed in central uruzgan province since 2006 .
but now , after a political row in the netherlands , the army has been forced to pull out of the country .
a statement from the international security force said , " dutch forces have served with distinction on uruzgan , and we honour their sacrifice and that of their afghan counterparts during the netherlands ' tenure in the province . "
nato had asked the netherlands to extend their work in uruzgan province , where opium production is rife , and the taliban remain active .
the row over the dutch presence in afghanistan led to the collapse of the coalition government in february .
the mission has cost the dutch state some 1.4 billion euros -lrb- 1.8 billion dollars -rrb- .
24 dutch soldiers have died during the afghan mission .
praise for the withdrawing force the dutch were widely admired for their comprehensive approach to defence , development and diplomacy .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen praised them as " the benchmark for others . "
us president barack obama said they were " one of the most outstanding " forces in afghanistan .
the withdrawal comes at a sensitive time for the nato alliance .
canada is also pulling its soldiers out of afghanistan next year , whilst britain and the us have pledged to reduce their troop numbers by 2011 .

the un cultural committee announced the news at a conference in brazil on sunday . the unesco committee has declared an 850-year-old water management system in the upper harz region of germany as a world heritage site .
at a conference in brasília , brazil the united nations cultural organization discussed applications for world heritage status for 32 new sites .
according to unesco spokesperson , sue williams , the 21 experts at the conference decided unanimously to put the german water system on the list of world heritage sites .
" there 's no comparable system anywhere , " according to professor reinhard roseneck , responsible for environmental heritage in the lower saxony region , who helped prepare the german application .
the water management system is one of the biggest surviving pre-industrial energy suppliers .
it consists of a vast series of dams , canals , water wheels and underground water chambers and originally provided energy for mining .
the earliest features date from the 12th century and were built by cistercian monks .
the success of mining in the region contributed to economic prosperity in the middle ages and beyond .
will this put the region on the map ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its picturesque ponds and lakes , the region already attracts thousands of tourists the nearby rammelsberg mines and the ancient town of goslar were awarded world heritage status in 1992 .
the new award extends recognition to the water system that served the area .
whilst unesco status is seen as a badge of honour for the region , it remains to be seen whether it will boost tourism .
the waterways are already a popular holiday destination .
" it could affect tourism , but i do n't know how it would affect it because harz is already a tourist region , " said dieter offenhauser , deputy secretary general of the german unesco commission .
still in use today this vast system of caves , ponds and channels is in part still functioning , another thing that makes it unique .
it requires millions of euros of investment by the regional authorities .
maintaing and preserving the site is " a big responsibility , " according to dieter offenhauser .
to qualify for the world heritage list the historic monuments have to be managed and preserved appropriately .
the upper harz water management system will become germany 's 34th unesco world heritage site ; there are 890 such sites in the world .
