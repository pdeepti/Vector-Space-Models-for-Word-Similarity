the carrier hopes to make inroads into cutting the size of its carbon footprint . germany 's national air carrier lufthansa said on monday it would start to test the use of biofuel to supplement kerosene on one of its major domestic flights .
the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel being tested contains 50 percent vegetable oil a quarter of the fuel used by the airbus 321 airplanes operating on the route will be composed of a synthetic mixture made from 50 percent vegetable oil .

project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

the 90-year-old demjanjuk has denied the charges .
demjanjuk 's case might be the last major holocaust trial in germany .
the trial has made little progress since it opened on november 30 , 2009 .
one of the main problems has been a series of interruptions , said barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the public prosecutors ' office in munich .
" there have been days during the presentation of evidence in which no progress has been made due to motions being filed or other interruptions , " she said .
" if we could have operated more efficiently , we would have gotten much further or maybe even finished it . "
due to demjanjuk 's poor health -lrb- he suffers from low hemoglobin blood levels -rrb- , the court can only meet for about three hours a day .
demjanjuk follows the hearings from a hospital bed in the courtroom where he sometimes nods off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk has been known to doze off during the hearings " i think the defendant is sleeping , " public prosecutors attorney hans-joachim lutz recently told magistrate ralph alt during a court hearing .
in addition to that , demjanjuk 's lawyer , ulrich busch has been accused of purposely trying to delay the trial by recycling evidence , which was previously rejected .
at the start of the trial , busch accused the judges of being biased against his client .
on some occasions , the hearings have degenerated into shouting matches between busch and the presiding judge , ralph alt .
" not a perpetrator but a victim " according to busch , demjanjuk regards himself not as a perpetrator but as a victim .
" he still sees himself as a prisoner of war , he views the proceedings as a form of torture , " he said .
" of course he also gets owerwhelmed because of his mental health , he is in total despair . "
demjanjuk was born in ukraine and was first taken prisoner of war by the nazis . barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office , said that the evidence provided so far does show that demjanjuk committed the crimes he is accused of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense lawyer busch says there is no evidence against his client but this of course looks completely different to defense lawyer busch .
" over the past year , the court has not found one piece of evidence that implicates demjanjuk , " he said .
" and even though the court might express the opinion that he is guilty - an opinion is just a belief .
and a belief is no foundation for a verdict in accordance with the rule of law , " he added .
but there is little doubt that demjanjuk was in sobibor .
this view is echoed by cornelius nestler , a law professor who represents relatives of sobibor victims .
to him , one very probing question is whether demjanjuk acted to save himself from the nazi terror .
" but there has been no indication whatsoever to support that , " he said .
demjanjuk was put on trial once before in israel , but that country 's supreme court overturned his conviction of having been a guard at the treblinka camp , ruling that he had been the victim of mistaken identity .
the munich trial is expected to continue until at least march of 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy middle east -pipe- 30.11.2010 wikileaks revelations on iran create problems for gulf states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad now knows who his true allies are tensions in the middle east are increasing as the fallout from the latest wikileaks revelations spreads .
previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

geissler , who is a former secretary-general of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the project should continue , but that germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn , should agree to " decisive changes . "
" the project to build stuttgart 21 will most probably go ahead , " he said at a stuttgart news conference on tuesday .
he pointed out that stuttgart 21 already has planning permission , unlike the plans for modernization of the existing station , favored by critics of the underground railway .
abandoning the project would also be too expensive , geissler argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler led nine rounds of mediation talks controversial project stuttgart 21 divided the community in stuttgart , with thousands of supporters and opponents taking to the streets before the mediation talks started .
opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although around 290 trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
geissler recommended that the areas above the planned underground station be shielded from property speculators by setting up a foundation to handle their redevelopment .
he also asked deutsche bahn to improve the security aspects of the project .
stefan mappus , the premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , welcomed the recommendations .

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

" in the coming decade we face the following alternatives : either we reach agreement on missile defense and create a fully-fledged joint mechanism of cooperation , or ... a new round of the arms race will begin , " medvedev said on tuesday .
russia and nato agreed in lisbon earlier this month that they would work together on a new missile defense shield in europe , something russia had previously rejected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama plans to station interceptors on us navy ships demanding equal say medvedev , who has been striking a softer note with the us and europe in recent times and compared to his predecessor vladimir putin , insists that russia to be treated as an equal partner .
but that would imply a level of military and intelligence cooperation never before seen between the former cold war foes .
last september , us president barack obama announced an overhaul of his predecessor 's strategy on the missile shield , which critics said served the sole purpose of appeasing russia , which had been opposed to us plans to build land-based missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic .
those plans were scrapped in favor of interceptors based on us navy ships , designed to fend off missile threats from iran .
touchy topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and medvedev await the ratification of start by us lawmakers missile defense has been a tetchy topic between the us , europe and russia since the 1980s , but the decision to invite russia to participate in the shield was hailed as a breakthrough and seen as concrete evidence that obama is serious about resetting relations with russia .
but the devil is , as so often , in the details and medvedev 's warning of an arms race is a reminder that the particulars of the project still have to be ironed out .
russia is also still waiting for the us senate to ratify the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , signed by medvedev and obama in april .
it 's seen as the centerpiece of improved ties , but some us lawmakers are worried it may weaken us nuclear defenses .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

those who stayed behind are worried the north could attack again . loudspeakers around the island blast announcements telling residents that they should come to the community center if they want to be evacuated and go to the mainland .
however , most of the 1,600 residents of the island have already left . at the community center , district director choi cheol young tells me that the people who stayed behind did so either because they have no means to support themselves off the island or because they were too old to take the two-hour ferry ride to incheon , the closest port . choi says the decision to stay or go is ultimately up to the residents .
" we do not encourage anyone to leave the island and go to incheon .
but if they stay , we support them administratively and also provide them with food , " he explains . reduced to rubble just from walking around some of the areas that were damaged by north korea 's shelling last week , it is easy to see why so many of yeonpyeong ’ s residents took off . in one alleyway , there is broken glass everywhere .
several buildings have completely collapsed in on themselves and others were gutted by fire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahn gwang-hun says he will not leave the island as he has things to do such as make kimchi just one block away is the home of 51-year-old fisherman ahn gwang-hun .
he and his wife are washing cabbage to make kimchi . the military restrictions mean that he can not take his boat out to sea .
" we were actually making kimchi when the attack happened .
however , we are not ready to leave the island , there are still many things we need to do here , " he says . prefabricated houses to replace destroyed homes while fishermen can not work , engineers are busy trying to get the island ’ s utilities back up and running .
there are electric crews up on telephone polls , running new power lines in neighborhoods damaged during the attack . one electrician tells me that all the repair work is almost done .
in what was the playground for yeonpyeong 's elementary school , construction crews are putting together small fabricated houses . " we are building 15 temporary houses for the people whose homes were completely destroyed during the north korean attack , explains the manager kim sam yeol . " when they return to the island they will have a place to stay while they reconstruct their own houses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean marine in yeongpyeong however , he adds that he doesn ’ t know when that will be .
some are not even sure if they will come back at all but choi cheol young is optimistic : " this island has a long history and i do not think it will ever be completely abandoned .
but the government will have to help encourage the people to move back to it . " it is likely to take more than just government help to encourage residents to return as many are worried that north korea will strike again .
after two civilians were killed last week , many locals realize this was no longer just a military fight . park myung jae , a resident of an adjacent island that was also shelled during the attack , has come from incheon to check on his home and then turn back around . " i don ’ t know when it will become peaceful enough for me to return to my home . " he says .
" over the years north korea has made many attacks near the island .
i think the government should have had more missile or soldiers stationed here , they failed to stop this attack from happening . " author : jason strother editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" without confidentiality , there is no information , no give-and-take , no access , " the paper wrote .
" without information , there is also no knowledge , no reasoning powers , no correct decisions .
the usa has been struggling for credibility in the world for years .
wikileaks has turned out to be the weapon of mass destruction for the last ounce of trust . "
" distrust does not only grow among low-ranked informants , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented .
" heads of state have been embarrassed , and the consequences for their countries ' relations towards the states and politicians who had been talking about them are difficult to foresee .
such disclosures could have a much more destructive effect in the world 's trouble spots than in the areas of tension within -lsb- germany 's governing -rsb- coalition . "
france 's daily liberation wrote that a country could not act in a world full of violent conflicts while under constant observation by the public .
the state " has the right to protect its defense secrets , to talk to allies or foes by ensuring confidentiality and to conduct special missions provided that they are suspect to supervision by elected representatives . "
the paper added that it was " a paradox that wikileaks attacks first and foremost democracies and leaves the darkest and most oppressive dictatorships aside . "
madrid-based daily el pais took a different line : " according to the vienna convention , diplomats have the right to gather any information on a country that can be legally obtained .
the recent disclosures do not show that the us has violated the law .
but they do prove that the americans are too prone to secretiveness .
information is kept under lock and key that is in the public interest .
however , transparency is the most important weapon in the fight against arbitrariness and corruption .
the disclosures also reveal the demise of us leadership in world politics . "
the financial times commented that not all information belongs in the public domain .
" in order for states to conduct their affairs effectively , and ensure the security of their citizens , some secrets must remain .
wikileaks ' latest disclosure does not quite cross this line .
but nor does the release of this trove pass the public interest test unequivocally .
the material released so far does not reveal any wrongdoing . "

a novel feature : calling on private investors to help on a " case by case basis . " european finance ministers had a busy weekend .
first , they agreed to an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 111 billion -rrb- aid package for cash-strapped ireland .
then they threw their support behind a franco-german compromise for resolving debt crises in the eurozone from mid-2013 onward .
financial markets displayed a largely negative reaction on monday to the multibillion-euro rescue package for ireland and the announcement of new rules for dealing with future debt crises .
the weeks ahead will tell whether the measures are enough to quell market fears of contagion spreading to other heavily indebted euro countries , like portugal and spain .
diluted compromise under the agreement announced sunday , the current european financial stability facility – established as an ad hoc measure to support eurozone countries with sovereign debt problems after the greek crisis – will be replaced by the european stabilization mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- , based on a proposal by germany and france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy aim to stabilize the eurozone the compromise dilutes an earlier demand by chancellor angela merkel for investors to " automatically " assume losses and share bailout costs with taxpayers .
wording in the esm agreement now speaks of having private bondholders share the cost of restructuring a eurozone country 's debt on a " case-by-case basis . "
" the sunday agreement aligns europe with the international monetary fund practice that -lrb- involving -rrb- private-sector creditors should be done on a case-by-case basis , " philip lane , a macroeconomics professor at trinity college dublin , told deutsche welle .
" this is sensible since every crisis is different and the appropriate policy response should be calibrated to the details of the crisis . "
although the agreement makes no mention of an " automatic " mechanism for bondholders , experts argue that such an instrument is implied nevertheless .
" in the cases that are likely to appear in the euro area , a high degree of automaticity , which germany sought in the area of sanctions for fiscal transgressions , seems overwhelmingly likely , " said niels christoffer thygesen , a retired economics professor at copenhagen university .
the lack of detail in an earlier franco-german deal on a crisis mechanism , agreed in october , and talk of private investors having to take losses , or " haircuts , " on the value of sovereign bonds , helped drive ireland over the cliff , critics claim .
tough fiscal adjustment program for weeks , european officials have been scrambling to play down possible links between ireland and portugal , which is seen as the next eurozone country at risk – and the possibility that troubles in portugal could quickly spread to spain because of their close economic ties .
under the new two-step plan , a eurozone country with liquidity problems would be able to apply for emergency funding from the esm subject to a tough fiscal adjustment program , without having to restructure its debt or agree to a standstill .
countries whose debt positions are judged by the imf , the european central bank and the european commission as unsustainable would have to enter into negotiations with creditors to restructure its debt as a condition for further bailout funding .
international monetary fund procedures would apply in the esm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf procedures would apply in the new euro stablization scheme the plan has won some praise from the investment community but also raised some concern .
" i think the idea of differentiating between a liquidity and a solvency crisis is a good one in theory , but it will be difficult to distinguish in practice , and the decision will always inevitably be partly political , " said marco annunziata , chief economist of the unicredit group .
" just think how often in the last three years we have been unsure whether banks and governments were illiquid or insolvent . "
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies in brussels , agrees the highly complex esm could be challenging to implement .
" there are no rules for proceeding on a step-by-step basis , " he told deutsche welle .
" this will be extremely difficult and will vary from country to country . "
the permanent crisis resolution mechanism , to be finalized in the weeks ahead , promises a break with several longstanding taboos in the europe union .
for instance , it effectively drops the " no bailout " clause in the eu treaty , accepts for the first time the possibility of a sovereign default in the eurozone and allows for the possibility of making private bondholders share the cost with taxpayers .
" overall , this sends a clear message to private investors to be very careful before lending to governments , " said unicredit 's annunziata .

fifa had already suspended two executive committee members over similar allegations . a bbc television report and an article in the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper prompted watchdog body transparency international to call for a thorough independent investigation and for thursday 's vote in zurich to be postponed .
" fifa 's integrity and credibility , already shaken in the past , have been badly tarnished and the reputational damage suffered by fifa these last weeks is considerable , " the anti-corruption organization said in a statement .
" the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football world cup must be postponed until all light has been shed on the allegations published in the press .
these have cast such discredit on fifa 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . "
' unpatriotic ' timing the bbc television program " panorama , " which aired on monday night , accused three fifa executives of taking bribes worth millions of dollars .
the three men - ricardo teixera of brazil , african football chief issa hayatou and south america 's nicolas leoz - are alleged to have received secret payments from the international sports and leisure -lrb- isl -rrb- sports marketing firm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations fifa president sepp blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations facing the executives , though in the " panorama " report he had said that all isl officials implicated in the bribery scandal had been exonerated .
meanwhile , officials campaigning for england 's 2018 bid have since lashed out at the bbc for running the report , which they deemed " sensationalist " and ill-timed .
" if -lsb- the bbc -rsb- truly believes there 's a journalistic reason to run this panorama - and that that 's their decision - then they could have done it at any time in the past two years , " england bid chief andy anson said .
" to do it the week before the vote is about one thing - sensationalism .
i do n't think that 's helpful and i do n't think it 's patriotic . "
england is up against favorites russia and the two joint bids from spain / portugal and holland / belgium to host the 2018 world cup .
the 2022 race , also scheduled to be decided in thursday 's vote , sees australia , qatar , japan , south korea and the united states vying for the competition .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .
it has urged the us to deal with the fallout appropriately . " we have seen the reports .
we hope that the us side will properly handle relevant issues , " said foreign ministry spokesman hong lei , refusing to comment on the contents . some of the other disclosed documents have hinted that china could be willing to accept a reunified korea under south korean control .
however , it would not be willing to welcome us troops on northern korean territory were reunification to take place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us suspects china 's top leadership to be behind a hacking campaign against google the relationship between china and its erratic ally is not the only controversial theme in the documents revealed by wikileaks . it would seem that according to certain us officials recent cyber attacks on the search engine google might have been organized by the top chinese leadership . but hong lei refused to comment on this too : " we do n't want to see any disturbance to china-us relations , " he said . little coverage of leaks in chinese media there has not been much talk about the wikileaks revelations in china .
the wikileaks website is blocked and the chinese media are only allowed to report generally about the leaks .
there has been nothing in the coverage about china or north korea . there is also very little to be found on the internet - a sign that the censors have been deleting user comments and warning internet servers . but one commentator did manage to get around the censors : " respect !

the carrier hopes to make inroads into cutting the size of its carbon footprint . germany 's national air carrier lufthansa said on monday it would start to test the use of biofuel to supplement kerosene on one of its major domestic flights .
the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel being tested contains 50 percent vegetable oil a quarter of the fuel used by the airbus 321 airplanes operating on the route will be composed of a synthetic mixture made from 50 percent vegetable oil .
up to four times more costly than kerosene lufthansa plans to spend 6.6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.7 million -rrb- on the project , estimating that the biofuel will cost three to four times more than kerosene .
project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

global ideas presents four projects which are using solar energy to help transform lives - and economies . ethiopia the village of rema is situated on a plateau in northern ethiopia , and is home to the country 's largest solar project , set up five years ago with financial support from germany 's solar energy foundation .
since then , 1,200 solar systems have been installed in rema , bringing power to over 5,000 people in a country where only one percent of the population in rural areas has access to electricity .
the first international solar energy school , where students from technical schools are trained to manage solar energy , also opened its doors here .
the school itself is powered by solar energy , with a photovoltaic system providing electricity and a solar thermal system providing warm water .
the solar panels in rema are used to power lighting , refrigeration for medicine , water pumps , and water disinfection plants .
the pioneering project is now being introduced in other villages .
india only one in three indians has access to electricity .
the rest of the population uses kerosene lamps , which burn almost 60 million tons of oil in developing nations every year .
in a village some 100 kilometers away from mumbai , the local adivasi or tribal community have begun using mobile lamps powered by solar energy .
even the children benefit : now , they can continue to do schoolwork even when it 's dark .
morocco morocco has launched what it claims is the biggest solar-thermal energy project in a single country .
located in the east of the country near the algerian border , the plant is now supplying electricity to the moroccan grid , using over 200 parabolic mirror collectors concentrating sun energy and boosting the steam output needed to produce electricity .
and it 's just the beginning : morocco is preparing major solar power projects on a total of five sites , with state-of-the-art solar facilities composed of photovoltaic and solar thermal energy mechanisms .
we accompany moroccan solar energy pioneer abdelaziz bennouna to one of these new locations .
by 2020 , the country expects to draw over 40 percent of its energy needs from solar , wind , hydro power and biomass .
spain the plataforma solar de almeria is the largest european center for research , development and testing of concentrating solar technologies .
we meet up with christoph richter from the german aerospace center , who has spent over 15 years developing concepts for solar thermal power plants in spain .
like many experts , he believes the future belongs to solar power towers -lrb- also known as ' central tower ' power plants or ' heliostat ' power plants -rrb- .
these focus the sun 's rays upon a collector tower and boast designs that allow power to be generated even when the sun is not shining .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 30.11.2010 libyan power struggle raises questions about post-gadhafi future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi is torn between his reformer son and his conservative government a recent spat between conservatives and reformers in libya has left leader colonel moammar gadhafi sitting on a fence between his government and his son , who is assembling a tribal coalition behind his reform movement . a new round in an ongoing power struggle between reformers and defenders of the status quo in libya has left gadhafi - who has led the country for over 40 years - in something of a dilemma .
but as has always been the case , the ultimate decision lies with him - and he is clearly not yet ready to give his verdict . the latest row pitted gadhafi 's pro-reform son saif al-islam against powerful conservatives in the government , ending in another stalemate and continued uncertainty about the oil exporter 's future direction . it began soon after a media group linked to saif al-islam launched a fierce attack on the government .
in apparent retaliation , 20 of the group 's journalists were detained and one of its newspapers was suspended .
the spat only ended when gadhafi intervened personally , and ordered that the journalists be freed . fence sitting the incident illustrates gadhafi 's position in libyan politics as the 68-year-old 's reign enters its final phase .
he stands apparently comfortable in his position as mediator , while political rivals - not least among them some of his sons - begin to vie for his legacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some observers say saif al-islam lacks his father 's charisma and political savvy charles gurdon , libya expert at the london-based political risk consultancy menas associates , said he believes gadhafi is himself caught in a personal struggle between conservatism and reform . " when you look at gadhafi , i think it 's best to think of his heart and his head , " gurdon told deutsche welle .
" at heart , he is still a revolutionary .
for decades he 's been anti-western , has had little interest in the economy , and not a lot of interest in political or economy modernization .
his main interest remains in foreign policy and , in particular , his personal legacy in both the middle east and africa . " but international developments in the last decade have brought out the pragmatist in gadhafi , he said . " his head recognized that a rapprochement with the west , and particularly with the us , was essential in 2003 if libya was to avoid being attacked as iraq was , " gurdon said .
libya was one of the countries in washington 's so-called " axis of evil . " in from the cold as a result , in the past six years , libya has gone from international outcast with a stagnating economy to a bustling country where new office buildings and hotels spring up every month .
foreign businesspeople flock in search of lucrative deals , the largest concerning libya 's rich oil reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is modernizing fast , but needs more infrastructure reform " gadhafi recognized that the oil sector is the economy 's milk cow and that it urgently needed modernization and foreign investment , " gurdon said .
" continuing international sanctions had severely weakened the sector and therefore , there had to be a radical change in policy . " but isabelle werenfels , researcher for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- points out that attracting foreign investment means a lot more than reforming the economy .
western-educated saif al-islam is currently leading a movement that potentially means a wholesale reform of many aspects of libyan society . " the son sees the mid to long-term problems of the country if they do n't embark on economic reforms , but also the modernization of infrastructure , the constitution and education , " werenfels said .
however , gadhafi 's commitment to this is ambiguous , according to gurdon . " with colonel gadhafi , reform is always two steps forward , one step back , " gurdon said .
" but his son recognizes that things need to change in libya , and he 's spearheading the whole movement for a formal constitution , greater democracy , and other reforms which will turn libya into a normal country as we in the west would know it . " winning over the tribes saif al-islam faces much opposition from the old libyan revolutionaries , though .
his lack of military training has meant that he has no constituency in the army or the security services , whereas two of his younger brothers do .
to counter this , saif al-islam has reportedly been travelling around the country hoping to secure the support of some of libya 's all-important tribes . " libya is a very tribal state , and the whole gadhafi system is supported by a number of big tribes that gadhafi united around himself , " werenfels said .
" saif al-islam has been very busy in recent months , travelling to the east , where you have the more rebellious , more marginalized tribes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saif al-islam is hoping to appeal to young libyans granted , saif al-islam is winning popularity among the libyan population , but there are plenty of reasons why gadhafi will not name him as a successor any time soon , for example due to the country 's political structure . libya has a dual political system .
on the one hand , it has a pseudo-direct democratic system , and on the other it has a revolutionary sector made up of committees , informal groups , former comrades of gadhafi , free officer organizations and the security sector .
this second group is extremely powerful and has much to lose if saif al-islam takes over . " i 'm not sure gadhafi can afford to name him as a successor at this point , because there are so many people profiting from the status quo in the elite , " werenfels said . marshalling the endgame on top of this , gadhafi knows that naming saif al-islam as successor would instantly weaken his own position . " as with any leader who 's been in power for over 40 years , you have to work out your endgame , " gurdon said .
" the problem with all of the middle east republics is that , as soon as a successor is nominated , it makes the head of state a lame duck . "
and then there is the old tugging on gadhafi 's revolutionary heart . " libya needs foreign investments - it wants to be part of the international community , " gurdon said .
" at the same time , gadhafi is very reluctant to scrap the political and economic system that he has established and maintained for over 40 years . " but whatever happens , post-gadhafi libya is bound to be profoundly different . " whenever gadhafi eventually goes , i think libya will operate more like a normal country , " gurdon said .
" it is much less likely to be the maverick state it has been in the past . " gadhafi has no official position in the country 's legal system .
he calls himself only the " guide of the revolution . "
if nothing else , it is unlikely that any successor will occupy a similarly unique position above and outside the libyan system .
this in itself will be an irreversible reform . author : ben knight editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to counter this , saif al-islam has reportedly been travelling around the country hoping to secure the support of some of libya 's all-important tribes . " libya is a very tribal state , and the whole gadhafi system is supported by a number of big tribes that gadhafi united around himself , " werenfels said .
" saif al-islam has been very busy in recent months , travelling to the east , where you have the more rebellious , more marginalized tribes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saif al-islam is hoping to appeal to young libyans granted , saif al-islam is winning popularity among the libyan population , but there are plenty of reasons why gadhafi will not name him as a successor any time soon , for example due to the country 's political structure . libya has a dual political system .
on the one hand , it has a pseudo-direct democratic system , and on the other it has a revolutionary sector made up of committees , informal groups , former comrades of gadhafi , free officer organizations and the security sector .
this second group is extremely powerful and has much to lose if saif al-islam takes over . " i 'm not sure gadhafi can afford to name him as a successor at this point , because there are so many people profiting from the status quo in the elite , " werenfels said . marshalling the endgame on top of this , gadhafi knows that naming saif al-islam as successor would instantly weaken his own position . " as with any leader who 's been in power for over 40 years , you have to work out your endgame , " gurdon said .
" the problem with all of the middle east republics is that , as soon as a successor is nominated , it makes the head of state a lame duck . "
and then there is the old tugging on gadhafi 's revolutionary heart . " libya needs foreign investments - it wants to be part of the international community , " gurdon said .
" at the same time , gadhafi is very reluctant to scrap the political and economic system that he has established and maintained for over 40 years . " but whatever happens , post-gadhafi libya is bound to be profoundly different . " whenever gadhafi eventually goes , i think libya will operate more like a normal country , " gurdon said .
" it is much less likely to be the maverick state it has been in the past . " gadhafi has no official position in the country 's legal system .
he calls himself only the " guide of the revolution . "
if nothing else , it is unlikely that any successor will occupy a similarly unique position above and outside the libyan system .
this in itself will be an irreversible reform . author : ben knight editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

geissler , who is a former secretary-general of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the project should continue , but that germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn , should agree to " decisive changes . "
" the project to build stuttgart 21 will most probably go ahead , " he said at a stuttgart news conference on tuesday .
he pointed out that stuttgart 21 already has planning permission , unlike the plans for modernization of the existing station , favored by critics of the underground railway .
abandoning the project would also be too expensive , geissler argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler led nine rounds of mediation talks controversial project stuttgart 21 divided the community in stuttgart , with thousands of supporters and opponents taking to the streets before the mediation talks started .
opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although around 290 trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
geissler recommended that the areas above the planned underground station be shielded from property speculators by setting up a foundation to handle their redevelopment .
he also asked deutsche bahn to improve the security aspects of the project .
stefan mappus , the premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , welcomed the recommendations .
" we want to face up to this stress test , because we think it 's only fair that we openly discuss what the strengths and weaknesses of this project are , and to get rid of the weaknesses , " he said on tuesday .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

" in the coming decade we face the following alternatives : either we reach agreement on missile defense and create a fully-fledged joint mechanism of cooperation , or ... a new round of the arms race will begin , " medvedev said on tuesday .
russia and nato agreed in lisbon earlier this month that they would work together on a new missile defense shield in europe , something russia had previously rejected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama plans to station interceptors on us navy ships demanding equal say medvedev , who has been striking a softer note with the us and europe in recent times and compared to his predecessor vladimir putin , insists that russia to be treated as an equal partner .
but that would imply a level of military and intelligence cooperation never before seen between the former cold war foes .
last september , us president barack obama announced an overhaul of his predecessor 's strategy on the missile shield , which critics said served the sole purpose of appeasing russia , which had been opposed to us plans to build land-based missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic .
those plans were scrapped in favor of interceptors based on us navy ships , designed to fend off missile threats from iran .
touchy topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and medvedev await the ratification of start by us lawmakers missile defense has been a tetchy topic between the us , europe and russia since the 1980s , but the decision to invite russia to participate in the shield was hailed as a breakthrough and seen as concrete evidence that obama is serious about resetting relations with russia .
but the devil is , as so often , in the details and medvedev 's warning of an arms race is a reminder that the particulars of the project still have to be ironed out .
russia is also still waiting for the us senate to ratify the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , signed by medvedev and obama in april .
it 's seen as the centerpiece of improved ties , but some us lawmakers are worried it may weaken us nuclear defenses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

" in the coming decade we face the following alternatives : either we reach agreement on missile defense and create a fully-fledged joint mechanism of cooperation , or ... a new round of the arms race will begin , " medvedev said on tuesday .
russia and nato agreed in lisbon earlier this month that they would work together on a new missile defense shield in europe , something russia had previously rejected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama plans to station interceptors on us navy ships demanding equal say medvedev , who has been striking a softer note with the us and europe in recent times and compared to his predecessor vladimir putin , insists that russia to be treated as an equal partner .
but that would imply a level of military and intelligence cooperation never before seen between the former cold war foes .
last september , us president barack obama announced an overhaul of his predecessor 's strategy on the missile shield , which critics said served the sole purpose of appeasing russia , which had been opposed to us plans to build land-based missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic .
those plans were scrapped in favor of interceptors based on us navy ships , designed to fend off missile threats from iran .
touchy topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and medvedev await the ratification of start by us lawmakers missile defense has been a tetchy topic between the us , europe and russia since the 1980s , but the decision to invite russia to participate in the shield was hailed as a breakthrough and seen as concrete evidence that obama is serious about resetting relations with russia .
but the devil is , as so often , in the details and medvedev 's warning of an arms race is a reminder that the particulars of the project still have to be ironed out .
russia is also still waiting for the us senate to ratify the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , signed by medvedev and obama in april .
it 's seen as the centerpiece of improved ties , but some us lawmakers are worried it may weaken us nuclear defenses .

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

the usa has been struggling for credibility in the world for years .
wikileaks has turned out to be the weapon of mass destruction for the last ounce of trust . "

france 's daily liberation wrote that a country could not act in a world full of violent conflicts while under constant observation by the public .
the state " has the right to protect its defense secrets , to talk to allies or foes by ensuring confidentiality and to conduct special missions provided that they are suspect to supervision by elected representatives . "
the paper added that it was " a paradox that wikileaks attacks first and foremost democracies and leaves the darkest and most oppressive dictatorships aside . "
madrid-based daily el pais took a different line : " according to the vienna convention , diplomats have the right to gather any information on a country that can be legally obtained .

however , transparency is the most important weapon in the fight against arbitrariness and corruption .
the disclosures also reveal the demise of us leadership in world politics . "
the financial times commented that not all information belongs in the public domain .
" in order for states to conduct their affairs effectively , and ensure the security of their citizens , some secrets must remain .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .

the authorities can now use controversial stolen cds that list alleged evaders . judges of the german constitutional court issued a landmark ruling on tuesday permitting the use of stolen information in cases brought against tax evaders .
the karlsruhe-based court ruled against a german woman 's claim that the investigation into her case was " illegal " because it was based on a stolen cd purchased by germany 's bka intelligence agency in 2008 .
authorities in bochum used information on the disc - containing account information from a bank in the small alpine tax haven of liechtenstein - as grounds to search the woman 's apartment , to which she objected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizens may have more than 23 billion euros in swiss bank accounts the court rejected the claim , ruling instead that such police searches are legal and all evidence obtained through them admissible .
a dangerous precedent ?
despite the financial benefits for the state , tax lawyer jens schmidt of the international law firm white and case is not happy with the decision , mainly because it effectively puts state prosecutors above the law .
" i do n't really see this as a positive development , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's always this consideration in the background - the principle is , state prosecutors are n't allowed to do anything illegal .
but then they do n't draw the conclusion - as you would do for instance under us law - that this makes the whole investigation impermissible . "
but for thomas eigenthaler of the german tax workers union , tax investigators have a duty to get information about tax cheats any way they can .
" tax investigators and tax workers need clarity , " he commented . " as far as we 're concerned - if you can buy the data , you have to buy the data , and the political parties that deny this will gain a reputation for protecting tax evaders . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds may be obtained illegally sudden honesty before tuesday 's ruling , germany 's 16 federal states had been divided over using the data to investigate tax evaders .
but now authorities in all states will be able to prosecute tax evaders , irrespective of how evidence is gathered .
in february , authorities in the state of north-rhine westphalia bought a stolen tax cd for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- containing information on over 1,000 accounts at a swiss bank .
at least six more such cds have since been bought by german authorities , at a cost of several million euros each .
for the state it 's probably very good business : it is estimated the tax man could stand to receive up to a billion euros in back taxes thanks to the cds .
in response , around 20,000 germans turned themselves into the authorities , resulting in surpluses of over one billion euros in government coffers .

but to date , no real progress has been made . it has been one year since the beginning of the trial against john demjanjuk , who is accused of helping to murder about 28,000 jews at the sobibor death camp .
the 90-year-old demjanjuk has denied the charges .
demjanjuk 's case might be the last major holocaust trial in germany .
the trial has made little progress since it opened on november 30 , 2009 .
one of the main problems has been a series of interruptions , said barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the public prosecutors ' office in munich .
" there have been days during the presentation of evidence in which no progress has been made due to motions being filed or other interruptions , " she said .
" if we could have operated more efficiently , we would have gotten much further or maybe even finished it . "
due to demjanjuk 's poor health -lrb- he suffers from low hemoglobin blood levels -rrb- , the court can only meet for about three hours a day .
demjanjuk follows the hearings from a hospital bed in the courtroom where he sometimes nods off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk has been known to doze off during the hearings " i think the defendant is sleeping , " public prosecutors attorney hans-joachim lutz recently told magistrate ralph alt during a court hearing .
in addition to that , demjanjuk 's lawyer , ulrich busch has been accused of purposely trying to delay the trial by recycling evidence , which was previously rejected .
at the start of the trial , busch accused the judges of being biased against his client .
on some occasions , the hearings have degenerated into shouting matches between busch and the presiding judge , ralph alt .
" not a perpetrator but a victim " according to busch , demjanjuk regards himself not as a perpetrator but as a victim .
" he still sees himself as a prisoner of war , he views the proceedings as a form of torture , " he said .
" of course he also gets owerwhelmed because of his mental health , he is in total despair . "
demjanjuk was born in ukraine and was first taken prisoner of war by the nazis . barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office , said that the evidence provided so far does show that demjanjuk committed the crimes he is accused of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense lawyer busch says there is no evidence against his client but this of course looks completely different to defense lawyer busch .
" over the past year , the court has not found one piece of evidence that implicates demjanjuk , " he said .
" and even though the court might express the opinion that he is guilty - an opinion is just a belief .
and a belief is no foundation for a verdict in accordance with the rule of law , " he added .
but there is little doubt that demjanjuk was in sobibor .
this view is echoed by cornelius nestler , a law professor who represents relatives of sobibor victims .
to him , one very probing question is whether demjanjuk acted to save himself from the nazi terror .
" but there has been no indication whatsoever to support that , " he said .
demjanjuk was put on trial once before in israel , but that country 's supreme court overturned his conviction of having been a guard at the treblinka camp , ruling that he had been the victim of mistaken identity .
the munich trial is expected to continue until at least march of 2011 .

fifa had already suspended two executive committee members over similar allegations . a bbc television report and an article in the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper prompted watchdog body transparency international to call for a thorough independent investigation and for thursday 's vote in zurich to be postponed .
" fifa 's integrity and credibility , already shaken in the past , have been badly tarnished and the reputational damage suffered by fifa these last weeks is considerable , " the anti-corruption organization said in a statement .
" the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football world cup must be postponed until all light has been shed on the allegations published in the press .
these have cast such discredit on fifa 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . "
' unpatriotic ' timing the bbc television program " panorama , " which aired on monday night , accused three fifa executives of taking bribes worth millions of dollars .
the three men - ricardo teixera of brazil , african football chief issa hayatou and south america 's nicolas leoz - are alleged to have received secret payments from the international sports and leisure -lrb- isl -rrb- sports marketing firm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations fifa president sepp blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations facing the executives , though in the " panorama " report he had said that all isl officials implicated in the bribery scandal had been exonerated .
meanwhile , officials campaigning for england 's 2018 bid have since lashed out at the bbc for running the report , which they deemed " sensationalist " and ill-timed .
" if -lsb- the bbc -rsb- truly believes there 's a journalistic reason to run this panorama - and that that 's their decision - then they could have done it at any time in the past two years , " england bid chief andy anson said .
" to do it the week before the vote is about one thing - sensationalism .
i do n't think that 's helpful and i do n't think it 's patriotic . "
england is up against favorites russia and the two joint bids from spain / portugal and holland / belgium to host the 2018 world cup .
the 2022 race , also scheduled to be decided in thursday 's vote , sees australia , qatar , japan , south korea and the united states vying for the competition .

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

the carrier hopes to make inroads into cutting the size of its carbon footprint . germany 's national air carrier lufthansa said on monday it would start to test the use of biofuel to supplement kerosene on one of its major domestic flights .
the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .

project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 30.11.2010 european commission opens antitrust probe against google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google could faces fines up to 1.84 billion euros brussels has opened up an inquiry examining the californian company 's dominant position in the eu .
meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

global ideas presents four projects which are using solar energy to help transform lives - and economies . ethiopia the village of rema is situated on a plateau in northern ethiopia , and is home to the country 's largest solar project , set up five years ago with financial support from germany 's solar energy foundation .
since then , 1,200 solar systems have been installed in rema , bringing power to over 5,000 people in a country where only one percent of the population in rural areas has access to electricity .
the first international solar energy school , where students from technical schools are trained to manage solar energy , also opened its doors here .
the school itself is powered by solar energy , with a photovoltaic system providing electricity and a solar thermal system providing warm water .
the solar panels in rema are used to power lighting , refrigeration for medicine , water pumps , and water disinfection plants .
the pioneering project is now being introduced in other villages .
india only one in three indians has access to electricity .
the rest of the population uses kerosene lamps , which burn almost 60 million tons of oil in developing nations every year .
in a village some 100 kilometers away from mumbai , the local adivasi or tribal community have begun using mobile lamps powered by solar energy .
even the children benefit : now , they can continue to do schoolwork even when it 's dark .
morocco morocco has launched what it claims is the biggest solar-thermal energy project in a single country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 30.11.2010 libyan power struggle raises questions about post-gadhafi future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi is torn between his reformer son and his conservative government a recent spat between conservatives and reformers in libya has left leader colonel moammar gadhafi sitting on a fence between his government and his son , who is assembling a tribal coalition behind his reform movement . a new round in an ongoing power struggle between reformers and defenders of the status quo in libya has left gadhafi - who has led the country for over 40 years - in something of a dilemma .
but as has always been the case , the ultimate decision lies with him - and he is clearly not yet ready to give his verdict . the latest row pitted gadhafi 's pro-reform son saif al-islam against powerful conservatives in the government , ending in another stalemate and continued uncertainty about the oil exporter 's future direction . it began soon after a media group linked to saif al-islam launched a fierce attack on the government .
in apparent retaliation , 20 of the group 's journalists were detained and one of its newspapers was suspended .
the spat only ended when gadhafi intervened personally , and ordered that the journalists be freed . fence sitting the incident illustrates gadhafi 's position in libyan politics as the 68-year-old 's reign enters its final phase .
he stands apparently comfortable in his position as mediator , while political rivals - not least among them some of his sons - begin to vie for his legacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some observers say saif al-islam lacks his father 's charisma and political savvy charles gurdon , libya expert at the london-based political risk consultancy menas associates , said he believes gadhafi is himself caught in a personal struggle between conservatism and reform . " when you look at gadhafi , i think it 's best to think of his heart and his head , " gurdon told deutsche welle .
" at heart , he is still a revolutionary .
for decades he 's been anti-western , has had little interest in the economy , and not a lot of interest in political or economy modernization .
his main interest remains in foreign policy and , in particular , his personal legacy in both the middle east and africa . " but international developments in the last decade have brought out the pragmatist in gadhafi , he said . " his head recognized that a rapprochement with the west , and particularly with the us , was essential in 2003 if libya was to avoid being attacked as iraq was , " gurdon said .
libya was one of the countries in washington 's so-called " axis of evil . " in from the cold as a result , in the past six years , libya has gone from international outcast with a stagnating economy to a bustling country where new office buildings and hotels spring up every month .
foreign businesspeople flock in search of lucrative deals , the largest concerning libya 's rich oil reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is modernizing fast , but needs more infrastructure reform " gadhafi recognized that the oil sector is the economy 's milk cow and that it urgently needed modernization and foreign investment , " gurdon said .
" continuing international sanctions had severely weakened the sector and therefore , there had to be a radical change in policy . " but isabelle werenfels , researcher for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- points out that attracting foreign investment means a lot more than reforming the economy .
western-educated saif al-islam is currently leading a movement that potentially means a wholesale reform of many aspects of libyan society . " the son sees the mid to long-term problems of the country if they do n't embark on economic reforms , but also the modernization of infrastructure , the constitution and education , " werenfels said .
however , gadhafi 's commitment to this is ambiguous , according to gurdon . " with colonel gadhafi , reform is always two steps forward , one step back , " gurdon said .
" but his son recognizes that things need to change in libya , and he 's spearheading the whole movement for a formal constitution , greater democracy , and other reforms which will turn libya into a normal country as we in the west would know it . " winning over the tribes saif al-islam faces much opposition from the old libyan revolutionaries , though .
his lack of military training has meant that he has no constituency in the army or the security services , whereas two of his younger brothers do .
to counter this , saif al-islam has reportedly been travelling around the country hoping to secure the support of some of libya 's all-important tribes . " libya is a very tribal state , and the whole gadhafi system is supported by a number of big tribes that gadhafi united around himself , " werenfels said .
" saif al-islam has been very busy in recent months , travelling to the east , where you have the more rebellious , more marginalized tribes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saif al-islam is hoping to appeal to young libyans granted , saif al-islam is winning popularity among the libyan population , but there are plenty of reasons why gadhafi will not name him as a successor any time soon , for example due to the country 's political structure . libya has a dual political system .
on the one hand , it has a pseudo-direct democratic system , and on the other it has a revolutionary sector made up of committees , informal groups , former comrades of gadhafi , free officer organizations and the security sector .
this second group is extremely powerful and has much to lose if saif al-islam takes over . " i 'm not sure gadhafi can afford to name him as a successor at this point , because there are so many people profiting from the status quo in the elite , " werenfels said . marshalling the endgame on top of this , gadhafi knows that naming saif al-islam as successor would instantly weaken his own position . " as with any leader who 's been in power for over 40 years , you have to work out your endgame , " gurdon said .
" the problem with all of the middle east republics is that , as soon as a successor is nominated , it makes the head of state a lame duck . "
and then there is the old tugging on gadhafi 's revolutionary heart . " libya needs foreign investments - it wants to be part of the international community , " gurdon said .
" at the same time , gadhafi is very reluctant to scrap the political and economic system that he has established and maintained for over 40 years . " but whatever happens , post-gadhafi libya is bound to be profoundly different . " whenever gadhafi eventually goes , i think libya will operate more like a normal country , " gurdon said .
" it is much less likely to be the maverick state it has been in the past . " gadhafi has no official position in the country 's legal system .
he calls himself only the " guide of the revolution . "
if nothing else , it is unlikely that any successor will occupy a similarly unique position above and outside the libyan system .
this in itself will be an irreversible reform . author : ben knight editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 30.11.2010 libyan power struggle raises questions about post-gadhafi future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi is torn between his reformer son and his conservative government a recent spat between conservatives and reformers in libya has left leader colonel moammar gadhafi sitting on a fence between his government and his son , who is assembling a tribal coalition behind his reform movement . a new round in an ongoing power struggle between reformers and defenders of the status quo in libya has left gadhafi - who has led the country for over 40 years - in something of a dilemma .
but as has always been the case , the ultimate decision lies with him - and he is clearly not yet ready to give his verdict . the latest row pitted gadhafi 's pro-reform son saif al-islam against powerful conservatives in the government , ending in another stalemate and continued uncertainty about the oil exporter 's future direction . it began soon after a media group linked to saif al-islam launched a fierce attack on the government .
in apparent retaliation , 20 of the group 's journalists were detained and one of its newspapers was suspended .
the spat only ended when gadhafi intervened personally , and ordered that the journalists be freed . fence sitting the incident illustrates gadhafi 's position in libyan politics as the 68-year-old 's reign enters its final phase .
he stands apparently comfortable in his position as mediator , while political rivals - not least among them some of his sons - begin to vie for his legacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some observers say saif al-islam lacks his father 's charisma and political savvy charles gurdon , libya expert at the london-based political risk consultancy menas associates , said he believes gadhafi is himself caught in a personal struggle between conservatism and reform . " when you look at gadhafi , i think it 's best to think of his heart and his head , " gurdon told deutsche welle .
" at heart , he is still a revolutionary .
for decades he 's been anti-western , has had little interest in the economy , and not a lot of interest in political or economy modernization .
his main interest remains in foreign policy and , in particular , his personal legacy in both the middle east and africa . " but international developments in the last decade have brought out the pragmatist in gadhafi , he said . " his head recognized that a rapprochement with the west , and particularly with the us , was essential in 2003 if libya was to avoid being attacked as iraq was , " gurdon said .
libya was one of the countries in washington 's so-called " axis of evil . " in from the cold as a result , in the past six years , libya has gone from international outcast with a stagnating economy to a bustling country where new office buildings and hotels spring up every month .
foreign businesspeople flock in search of lucrative deals , the largest concerning libya 's rich oil reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is modernizing fast , but needs more infrastructure reform " gadhafi recognized that the oil sector is the economy 's milk cow and that it urgently needed modernization and foreign investment , " gurdon said .
" continuing international sanctions had severely weakened the sector and therefore , there had to be a radical change in policy . " but isabelle werenfels , researcher for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- points out that attracting foreign investment means a lot more than reforming the economy .
western-educated saif al-islam is currently leading a movement that potentially means a wholesale reform of many aspects of libyan society . " the son sees the mid to long-term problems of the country if they do n't embark on economic reforms , but also the modernization of infrastructure , the constitution and education , " werenfels said .
however , gadhafi 's commitment to this is ambiguous , according to gurdon . " with colonel gadhafi , reform is always two steps forward , one step back , " gurdon said .
" but his son recognizes that things need to change in libya , and he 's spearheading the whole movement for a formal constitution , greater democracy , and other reforms which will turn libya into a normal country as we in the west would know it . " winning over the tribes saif al-islam faces much opposition from the old libyan revolutionaries , though .
his lack of military training has meant that he has no constituency in the army or the security services , whereas two of his younger brothers do .
to counter this , saif al-islam has reportedly been travelling around the country hoping to secure the support of some of libya 's all-important tribes . " libya is a very tribal state , and the whole gadhafi system is supported by a number of big tribes that gadhafi united around himself , " werenfels said .
" saif al-islam has been very busy in recent months , travelling to the east , where you have the more rebellious , more marginalized tribes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saif al-islam is hoping to appeal to young libyans granted , saif al-islam is winning popularity among the libyan population , but there are plenty of reasons why gadhafi will not name him as a successor any time soon , for example due to the country 's political structure . libya has a dual political system .
on the one hand , it has a pseudo-direct democratic system , and on the other it has a revolutionary sector made up of committees , informal groups , former comrades of gadhafi , free officer organizations and the security sector .
this second group is extremely powerful and has much to lose if saif al-islam takes over . " i 'm not sure gadhafi can afford to name him as a successor at this point , because there are so many people profiting from the status quo in the elite , " werenfels said . marshalling the endgame on top of this , gadhafi knows that naming saif al-islam as successor would instantly weaken his own position . " as with any leader who 's been in power for over 40 years , you have to work out your endgame , " gurdon said .
" the problem with all of the middle east republics is that , as soon as a successor is nominated , it makes the head of state a lame duck . "
and then there is the old tugging on gadhafi 's revolutionary heart . " libya needs foreign investments - it wants to be part of the international community , " gurdon said .
" at the same time , gadhafi is very reluctant to scrap the political and economic system that he has established and maintained for over 40 years . " but whatever happens , post-gadhafi libya is bound to be profoundly different . " whenever gadhafi eventually goes , i think libya will operate more like a normal country , " gurdon said .
" it is much less likely to be the maverick state it has been in the past . " gadhafi has no official position in the country 's legal system .
he calls himself only the " guide of the revolution . "
if nothing else , it is unlikely that any successor will occupy a similarly unique position above and outside the libyan system .
this in itself will be an irreversible reform . author : ben knight editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

the carrier hopes to make inroads into cutting the size of its carbon footprint . germany 's national air carrier lufthansa said on monday it would start to test the use of biofuel to supplement kerosene on one of its major domestic flights .
the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel being tested contains 50 percent vegetable oil a quarter of the fuel used by the airbus 321 airplanes operating on the route will be composed of a synthetic mixture made from 50 percent vegetable oil .
up to four times more costly than kerosene lufthansa plans to spend 6.6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.7 million -rrb- on the project , estimating that the biofuel will cost three to four times more than kerosene .
project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy middle east -pipe- 30.11.2010 wikileaks revelations on iran create problems for gulf states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad now knows who his true allies are tensions in the middle east are increasing as the fallout from the latest wikileaks revelations spreads .
previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .
it has urged the us to deal with the fallout appropriately . " we have seen the reports .
we hope that the us side will properly handle relevant issues , " said foreign ministry spokesman hong lei , refusing to comment on the contents . some of the other disclosed documents have hinted that china could be willing to accept a reunified korea under south korean control .
however , it would not be willing to welcome us troops on northern korean territory were reunification to take place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us suspects china 's top leadership to be behind a hacking campaign against google the relationship between china and its erratic ally is not the only controversial theme in the documents revealed by wikileaks . it would seem that according to certain us officials recent cyber attacks on the search engine google might have been organized by the top chinese leadership . but hong lei refused to comment on this too : " we do n't want to see any disturbance to china-us relations , " he said . little coverage of leaks in chinese media there has not been much talk about the wikileaks revelations in china .
the wikileaks website is blocked and the chinese media are only allowed to report generally about the leaks .
there has been nothing in the coverage about china or north korea . there is also very little to be found on the internet - a sign that the censors have been deleting user comments and warning internet servers . but one commentator did manage to get around the censors : " respect !
wikileaks is powerful .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

global ideas presents four projects which are using solar energy to help transform lives - and economies . ethiopia the village of rema is situated on a plateau in northern ethiopia , and is home to the country 's largest solar project , set up five years ago with financial support from germany 's solar energy foundation .
since then , 1,200 solar systems have been installed in rema , bringing power to over 5,000 people in a country where only one percent of the population in rural areas has access to electricity .
the first international solar energy school , where students from technical schools are trained to manage solar energy , also opened its doors here .
the school itself is powered by solar energy , with a photovoltaic system providing electricity and a solar thermal system providing warm water .
the solar panels in rema are used to power lighting , refrigeration for medicine , water pumps , and water disinfection plants .
the pioneering project is now being introduced in other villages .
india only one in three indians has access to electricity .
the rest of the population uses kerosene lamps , which burn almost 60 million tons of oil in developing nations every year .
in a village some 100 kilometers away from mumbai , the local adivasi or tribal community have begun using mobile lamps powered by solar energy .
even the children benefit : now , they can continue to do schoolwork even when it 's dark .
morocco morocco has launched what it claims is the biggest solar-thermal energy project in a single country .
located in the east of the country near the algerian border , the plant is now supplying electricity to the moroccan grid , using over 200 parabolic mirror collectors concentrating sun energy and boosting the steam output needed to produce electricity .
and it 's just the beginning : morocco is preparing major solar power projects on a total of five sites , with state-of-the-art solar facilities composed of photovoltaic and solar thermal energy mechanisms .
we accompany moroccan solar energy pioneer abdelaziz bennouna to one of these new locations .
by 2020 , the country expects to draw over 40 percent of its energy needs from solar , wind , hydro power and biomass .
spain the plataforma solar de almeria is the largest european center for research , development and testing of concentrating solar technologies .
we meet up with christoph richter from the german aerospace center , who has spent over 15 years developing concepts for solar thermal power plants in spain .
like many experts , he believes the future belongs to solar power towers -lrb- also known as ' central tower ' power plants or ' heliostat ' power plants -rrb- .
these focus the sun 's rays upon a collector tower and boast designs that allow power to be generated even when the sun is not shining .

global ideas presents four projects which are using solar energy to help transform lives - and economies . ethiopia the village of rema is situated on a plateau in northern ethiopia , and is home to the country 's largest solar project , set up five years ago with financial support from germany 's solar energy foundation .
since then , 1,200 solar systems have been installed in rema , bringing power to over 5,000 people in a country where only one percent of the population in rural areas has access to electricity .
the first international solar energy school , where students from technical schools are trained to manage solar energy , also opened its doors here .
the school itself is powered by solar energy , with a photovoltaic system providing electricity and a solar thermal system providing warm water .
the solar panels in rema are used to power lighting , refrigeration for medicine , water pumps , and water disinfection plants .
the pioneering project is now being introduced in other villages .
india only one in three indians has access to electricity .
the rest of the population uses kerosene lamps , which burn almost 60 million tons of oil in developing nations every year .
in a village some 100 kilometers away from mumbai , the local adivasi or tribal community have begun using mobile lamps powered by solar energy .
even the children benefit : now , they can continue to do schoolwork even when it 's dark .
morocco morocco has launched what it claims is the biggest solar-thermal energy project in a single country .
located in the east of the country near the algerian border , the plant is now supplying electricity to the moroccan grid , using over 200 parabolic mirror collectors concentrating sun energy and boosting the steam output needed to produce electricity .
and it 's just the beginning : morocco is preparing major solar power projects on a total of five sites , with state-of-the-art solar facilities composed of photovoltaic and solar thermal energy mechanisms .
we accompany moroccan solar energy pioneer abdelaziz bennouna to one of these new locations .
by 2020 , the country expects to draw over 40 percent of its energy needs from solar , wind , hydro power and biomass .
spain the plataforma solar de almeria is the largest european center for research , development and testing of concentrating solar technologies .
we meet up with christoph richter from the german aerospace center , who has spent over 15 years developing concepts for solar thermal power plants in spain .
like many experts , he believes the future belongs to solar power towers -lrb- also known as ' central tower ' power plants or ' heliostat ' power plants -rrb- .
these focus the sun 's rays upon a collector tower and boast designs that allow power to be generated even when the sun is not shining .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 30.11.2010 libyan power struggle raises questions about post-gadhafi future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi is torn between his reformer son and his conservative government a recent spat between conservatives and reformers in libya has left leader colonel moammar gadhafi sitting on a fence between his government and his son , who is assembling a tribal coalition behind his reform movement . a new round in an ongoing power struggle between reformers and defenders of the status quo in libya has left gadhafi - who has led the country for over 40 years - in something of a dilemma .
but as has always been the case , the ultimate decision lies with him - and he is clearly not yet ready to give his verdict . the latest row pitted gadhafi 's pro-reform son saif al-islam against powerful conservatives in the government , ending in another stalemate and continued uncertainty about the oil exporter 's future direction . it began soon after a media group linked to saif al-islam launched a fierce attack on the government .
in apparent retaliation , 20 of the group 's journalists were detained and one of its newspapers was suspended .
the spat only ended when gadhafi intervened personally , and ordered that the journalists be freed . fence sitting the incident illustrates gadhafi 's position in libyan politics as the 68-year-old 's reign enters its final phase .
he stands apparently comfortable in his position as mediator , while political rivals - not least among them some of his sons - begin to vie for his legacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some observers say saif al-islam lacks his father 's charisma and political savvy charles gurdon , libya expert at the london-based political risk consultancy menas associates , said he believes gadhafi is himself caught in a personal struggle between conservatism and reform . " when you look at gadhafi , i think it 's best to think of his heart and his head , " gurdon told deutsche welle .
" at heart , he is still a revolutionary .
for decades he 's been anti-western , has had little interest in the economy , and not a lot of interest in political or economy modernization .
his main interest remains in foreign policy and , in particular , his personal legacy in both the middle east and africa . " but international developments in the last decade have brought out the pragmatist in gadhafi , he said . " his head recognized that a rapprochement with the west , and particularly with the us , was essential in 2003 if libya was to avoid being attacked as iraq was , " gurdon said .
libya was one of the countries in washington 's so-called " axis of evil . " in from the cold as a result , in the past six years , libya has gone from international outcast with a stagnating economy to a bustling country where new office buildings and hotels spring up every month .
foreign businesspeople flock in search of lucrative deals , the largest concerning libya 's rich oil reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is modernizing fast , but needs more infrastructure reform " gadhafi recognized that the oil sector is the economy 's milk cow and that it urgently needed modernization and foreign investment , " gurdon said .
" continuing international sanctions had severely weakened the sector and therefore , there had to be a radical change in policy . " but isabelle werenfels , researcher for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- points out that attracting foreign investment means a lot more than reforming the economy .
western-educated saif al-islam is currently leading a movement that potentially means a wholesale reform of many aspects of libyan society . " the son sees the mid to long-term problems of the country if they do n't embark on economic reforms , but also the modernization of infrastructure , the constitution and education , " werenfels said .
however , gadhafi 's commitment to this is ambiguous , according to gurdon . " with colonel gadhafi , reform is always two steps forward , one step back , " gurdon said .
" but his son recognizes that things need to change in libya , and he 's spearheading the whole movement for a formal constitution , greater democracy , and other reforms which will turn libya into a normal country as we in the west would know it . " winning over the tribes saif al-islam faces much opposition from the old libyan revolutionaries , though .
his lack of military training has meant that he has no constituency in the army or the security services , whereas two of his younger brothers do .
to counter this , saif al-islam has reportedly been travelling around the country hoping to secure the support of some of libya 's all-important tribes . " libya is a very tribal state , and the whole gadhafi system is supported by a number of big tribes that gadhafi united around himself , " werenfels said .
" saif al-islam has been very busy in recent months , travelling to the east , where you have the more rebellious , more marginalized tribes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saif al-islam is hoping to appeal to young libyans granted , saif al-islam is winning popularity among the libyan population , but there are plenty of reasons why gadhafi will not name him as a successor any time soon , for example due to the country 's political structure . libya has a dual political system .
on the one hand , it has a pseudo-direct democratic system , and on the other it has a revolutionary sector made up of committees , informal groups , former comrades of gadhafi , free officer organizations and the security sector .
this second group is extremely powerful and has much to lose if saif al-islam takes over . " i 'm not sure gadhafi can afford to name him as a successor at this point , because there are so many people profiting from the status quo in the elite , " werenfels said . marshalling the endgame on top of this , gadhafi knows that naming saif al-islam as successor would instantly weaken his own position . " as with any leader who 's been in power for over 40 years , you have to work out your endgame , " gurdon said .
" the problem with all of the middle east republics is that , as soon as a successor is nominated , it makes the head of state a lame duck . "
and then there is the old tugging on gadhafi 's revolutionary heart . " libya needs foreign investments - it wants to be part of the international community , " gurdon said .
" at the same time , gadhafi is very reluctant to scrap the political and economic system that he has established and maintained for over 40 years . " but whatever happens , post-gadhafi libya is bound to be profoundly different . " whenever gadhafi eventually goes , i think libya will operate more like a normal country , " gurdon said .
" it is much less likely to be the maverick state it has been in the past . " gadhafi has no official position in the country 's legal system .
he calls himself only the " guide of the revolution . "
if nothing else , it is unlikely that any successor will occupy a similarly unique position above and outside the libyan system .
this in itself will be an irreversible reform . author : ben knight editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

the carrier hopes to make inroads into cutting the size of its carbon footprint . germany 's national air carrier lufthansa said on monday it would start to test the use of biofuel to supplement kerosene on one of its major domestic flights .
the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel being tested contains 50 percent vegetable oil a quarter of the fuel used by the airbus 321 airplanes operating on the route will be composed of a synthetic mixture made from 50 percent vegetable oil .
up to four times more costly than kerosene lufthansa plans to spend 6.6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.7 million -rrb- on the project , estimating that the biofuel will cost three to four times more than kerosene .
project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

" without confidentiality , there is no information , no give-and-take , no access , " the paper wrote .
" without information , there is also no knowledge , no reasoning powers , no correct decisions .
the usa has been struggling for credibility in the world for years .
wikileaks has turned out to be the weapon of mass destruction for the last ounce of trust . "
" distrust does not only grow among low-ranked informants , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented .
" heads of state have been embarrassed , and the consequences for their countries ' relations towards the states and politicians who had been talking about them are difficult to foresee .
such disclosures could have a much more destructive effect in the world 's trouble spots than in the areas of tension within -lsb- germany 's governing -rsb- coalition . "
france 's daily liberation wrote that a country could not act in a world full of violent conflicts while under constant observation by the public .
the state " has the right to protect its defense secrets , to talk to allies or foes by ensuring confidentiality and to conduct special missions provided that they are suspect to supervision by elected representatives . "
the paper added that it was " a paradox that wikileaks attacks first and foremost democracies and leaves the darkest and most oppressive dictatorships aside . "
madrid-based daily el pais took a different line : " according to the vienna convention , diplomats have the right to gather any information on a country that can be legally obtained .
the recent disclosures do not show that the us has violated the law .
but they do prove that the americans are too prone to secretiveness .
information is kept under lock and key that is in the public interest .
however , transparency is the most important weapon in the fight against arbitrariness and corruption .
the disclosures also reveal the demise of us leadership in world politics . "
the financial times commented that not all information belongs in the public domain .
" in order for states to conduct their affairs effectively , and ensure the security of their citizens , some secrets must remain .
wikileaks ' latest disclosure does not quite cross this line .
but nor does the release of this trove pass the public interest test unequivocally .
the material released so far does not reveal any wrongdoing . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

but to date , no real progress has been made . it has been one year since the beginning of the trial against john demjanjuk , who is accused of helping to murder about 28,000 jews at the sobibor death camp .
the 90-year-old demjanjuk has denied the charges .
demjanjuk 's case might be the last major holocaust trial in germany .
the trial has made little progress since it opened on november 30 , 2009 .
one of the main problems has been a series of interruptions , said barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the public prosecutors ' office in munich .
" there have been days during the presentation of evidence in which no progress has been made due to motions being filed or other interruptions , " she said .
" if we could have operated more efficiently , we would have gotten much further or maybe even finished it . "
due to demjanjuk 's poor health -lrb- he suffers from low hemoglobin blood levels -rrb- , the court can only meet for about three hours a day .
demjanjuk follows the hearings from a hospital bed in the courtroom where he sometimes nods off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk has been known to doze off during the hearings " i think the defendant is sleeping , " public prosecutors attorney hans-joachim lutz recently told magistrate ralph alt during a court hearing .
in addition to that , demjanjuk 's lawyer , ulrich busch has been accused of purposely trying to delay the trial by recycling evidence , which was previously rejected .
at the start of the trial , busch accused the judges of being biased against his client .
on some occasions , the hearings have degenerated into shouting matches between busch and the presiding judge , ralph alt .
" not a perpetrator but a victim " according to busch , demjanjuk regards himself not as a perpetrator but as a victim .
" he still sees himself as a prisoner of war , he views the proceedings as a form of torture , " he said .
" of course he also gets owerwhelmed because of his mental health , he is in total despair . "
demjanjuk was born in ukraine and was first taken prisoner of war by the nazis . barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office , said that the evidence provided so far does show that demjanjuk committed the crimes he is accused of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense lawyer busch says there is no evidence against his client but this of course looks completely different to defense lawyer busch .
" over the past year , the court has not found one piece of evidence that implicates demjanjuk , " he said .
" and even though the court might express the opinion that he is guilty - an opinion is just a belief .
and a belief is no foundation for a verdict in accordance with the rule of law , " he added .
but there is little doubt that demjanjuk was in sobibor .
this view is echoed by cornelius nestler , a law professor who represents relatives of sobibor victims .
to him , one very probing question is whether demjanjuk acted to save himself from the nazi terror .
" but there has been no indication whatsoever to support that , " he said .
demjanjuk was put on trial once before in israel , but that country 's supreme court overturned his conviction of having been a guard at the treblinka camp , ruling that he had been the victim of mistaken identity .
the munich trial is expected to continue until at least march of 2011 .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy middle east -pipe- 30.11.2010 wikileaks revelations on iran create problems for gulf states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad now knows who his true allies are tensions in the middle east are increasing as the fallout from the latest wikileaks revelations spreads .
previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .

geissler , who is a former secretary-general of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the project should continue , but that germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn , should agree to " decisive changes . "
" the project to build stuttgart 21 will most probably go ahead , " he said at a stuttgart news conference on tuesday .
he pointed out that stuttgart 21 already has planning permission , unlike the plans for modernization of the existing station , favored by critics of the underground railway .
abandoning the project would also be too expensive , geissler argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler led nine rounds of mediation talks controversial project stuttgart 21 divided the community in stuttgart , with thousands of supporters and opponents taking to the streets before the mediation talks started .
opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although around 290 trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
geissler recommended that the areas above the planned underground station be shielded from property speculators by setting up a foundation to handle their redevelopment .
he also asked deutsche bahn to improve the security aspects of the project .
stefan mappus , the premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , welcomed the recommendations .
" we want to face up to this stress test , because we think it 's only fair that we openly discuss what the strengths and weaknesses of this project are , and to get rid of the weaknesses , " he said on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 30.11.2010 major exhibition brings european enlightenment art to beijing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition features nearly 600 works by european artists and scientists presenting works and ideas from the enlightenment period , the exhibition unveils the visual world of the western pre-modern era .
despite cultural differences , it is expected to generate great public interest in china . one of the world 's most significant enlightenment art exhibitions is due to open at the national museum of china in the spring of 2011 , titled " the art of the enlightenment . "
it comprises nearly 600 exhibits - including paintings , sculptures and even scientific inventions - that originate from the 18th-century western cultural movement which advocated reason as the primary source for legitimacy and authority . it is to be the first exhibition held at the beijing museum 's newly-renovated and expanded facilities - planned by hamburg architectural company gerkan , marg and partners .
the extension to the museum makes it the largest in the world . " the chinese public will appreciate the highly developed painting techniques and the artistic level of german and european artists , " commented huang zhenchun , the national museum 's deputy director . the exhibits are sourced from the berlin state museums collections , the dresden state art collections and the bavarian state picture collections . shaping of a culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich 's works often reflect enlightenment philosophy western art and culture , especially philosophy and science , have been well-received in china .
many works have been translated into chinese , and to this day political and social debates in china are strongly influenced by western thought .
director of the berlin state museums , michael eissenhauer , expects the new exhibition to be met with interest . " we always discover a deep knowledge of literature from this period in our -lsb- chinese -rsb- contacts , " said eissenhauer .
" but this is less true of visual art . " the exhibition aims to present the works in the context of ideological tradition .
for instance , when british painter henry fuseli depicts the battle between sin , satan , and death , it can be seen as a deviation from traditional christian dogma : the interest in evil represents a new-found freedom . likewise , the romantic-style paintings of german painter caspar david friedrich can be interpreted in the context of jean-jacques rousseau 's state-of-nature philosophy , according to klaus schrenk , director of the bavarian state picture collections . " rousseau makes one of the greatest demands on the development of humankind and questions the absolute power of french kings , " said schrenk .
similarly , friedrich 's works also represent mankind 's natural right to self-determination , he added . a discussion program between german and chinese scholars will help the public understand these parallels better .
the german federal foreign office , a co-sponsor , sees a political side of the exhibition . " -lsb- german philosopher -rsb- kant translated the ' sapere aude ' maxim of -lsb- roman -rsb- poet horace as ' have courage to use your own understanding , " ' said werner wnendt , head of the directorate-general for culture and communication at the federal foreign office .
" this motto of the enlightenment calls for politics to take this seriously and to allow the use of reasoning . " politics ' not the task of museums ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlightenment art questions old beliefs traditions the exhibition comes at a time when the values associated with the european enlightenment are a subject of heated debate .
the awarding of the nobel peace prize to chinese dissident writer liu xiaobo has once again attracted international attention to the topic of freedom of speech in china . one of the core concepts that emerged from the enlightenment - the idea that certain values are universal - has been intensely discussed in chinese intellectual circles in recent months .
however , according to eissenhauer , the art exhibition will not feature any references to current political ideology , which he believes is a matter for the foreign ministry , but " not the task of art museums . " the exhibition was meant to have opened this year , but was postponed due to delays in the museum building project .
the works are scheduled to remain in beijing for 15 months , with no other locations in china involved . author : mathias boelinger -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .
it has urged the us to deal with the fallout appropriately . " we have seen the reports .
we hope that the us side will properly handle relevant issues , " said foreign ministry spokesman hong lei , refusing to comment on the contents . some of the other disclosed documents have hinted that china could be willing to accept a reunified korea under south korean control .
however , it would not be willing to welcome us troops on northern korean territory were reunification to take place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us suspects china 's top leadership to be behind a hacking campaign against google the relationship between china and its erratic ally is not the only controversial theme in the documents revealed by wikileaks . it would seem that according to certain us officials recent cyber attacks on the search engine google might have been organized by the top chinese leadership . but hong lei refused to comment on this too : " we do n't want to see any disturbance to china-us relations , " he said . little coverage of leaks in chinese media there has not been much talk about the wikileaks revelations in china .
the wikileaks website is blocked and the chinese media are only allowed to report generally about the leaks .
there has been nothing in the coverage about china or north korea . there is also very little to be found on the internet - a sign that the censors have been deleting user comments and warning internet servers . but one commentator did manage to get around the censors : " respect !

the authorities can now use controversial stolen cds that list alleged evaders . judges of the german constitutional court issued a landmark ruling on tuesday permitting the use of stolen information in cases brought against tax evaders .
the karlsruhe-based court ruled against a german woman 's claim that the investigation into her case was " illegal " because it was based on a stolen cd purchased by germany 's bka intelligence agency in 2008 .
authorities in bochum used information on the disc - containing account information from a bank in the small alpine tax haven of liechtenstein - as grounds to search the woman 's apartment , to which she objected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizens may have more than 23 billion euros in swiss bank accounts the court rejected the claim , ruling instead that such police searches are legal and all evidence obtained through them admissible .
a dangerous precedent ?
despite the financial benefits for the state , tax lawyer jens schmidt of the international law firm white and case is not happy with the decision , mainly because it effectively puts state prosecutors above the law .
" i do n't really see this as a positive development , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's always this consideration in the background - the principle is , state prosecutors are n't allowed to do anything illegal .
but then they do n't draw the conclusion - as you would do for instance under us law - that this makes the whole investigation impermissible . "
but for thomas eigenthaler of the german tax workers union , tax investigators have a duty to get information about tax cheats any way they can .
" tax investigators and tax workers need clarity , " he commented . " as far as we 're concerned - if you can buy the data , you have to buy the data , and the political parties that deny this will gain a reputation for protecting tax evaders . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds may be obtained illegally sudden honesty before tuesday 's ruling , germany 's 16 federal states had been divided over using the data to investigate tax evaders .
but now authorities in all states will be able to prosecute tax evaders , irrespective of how evidence is gathered .
in february , authorities in the state of north-rhine westphalia bought a stolen tax cd for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- containing information on over 1,000 accounts at a swiss bank .
at least six more such cds have since been bought by german authorities , at a cost of several million euros each .
for the state it 's probably very good business : it is estimated the tax man could stand to receive up to a billion euros in back taxes thanks to the cds .
in response , around 20,000 germans turned themselves into the authorities , resulting in surpluses of over one billion euros in government coffers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy middle east -pipe- 30.11.2010 wikileaks revelations on iran create problems for gulf states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad now knows who his true allies are tensions in the middle east are increasing as the fallout from the latest wikileaks revelations spreads .
previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

but to date , no real progress has been made . it has been one year since the beginning of the trial against john demjanjuk , who is accused of helping to murder about 28,000 jews at the sobibor death camp .
the 90-year-old demjanjuk has denied the charges .
demjanjuk 's case might be the last major holocaust trial in germany .
the trial has made little progress since it opened on november 30 , 2009 .
one of the main problems has been a series of interruptions , said barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the public prosecutors ' office in munich .
" there have been days during the presentation of evidence in which no progress has been made due to motions being filed or other interruptions , " she said .
" if we could have operated more efficiently , we would have gotten much further or maybe even finished it . "
due to demjanjuk 's poor health -lrb- he suffers from low hemoglobin blood levels -rrb- , the court can only meet for about three hours a day .
demjanjuk follows the hearings from a hospital bed in the courtroom where he sometimes nods off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk has been known to doze off during the hearings " i think the defendant is sleeping , " public prosecutors attorney hans-joachim lutz recently told magistrate ralph alt during a court hearing .
in addition to that , demjanjuk 's lawyer , ulrich busch has been accused of purposely trying to delay the trial by recycling evidence , which was previously rejected .
at the start of the trial , busch accused the judges of being biased against his client .
on some occasions , the hearings have degenerated into shouting matches between busch and the presiding judge , ralph alt .
" not a perpetrator but a victim " according to busch , demjanjuk regards himself not as a perpetrator but as a victim .
" he still sees himself as a prisoner of war , he views the proceedings as a form of torture , " he said .
" of course he also gets owerwhelmed because of his mental health , he is in total despair . "
demjanjuk was born in ukraine and was first taken prisoner of war by the nazis . barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office , said that the evidence provided so far does show that demjanjuk committed the crimes he is accused of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense lawyer busch says there is no evidence against his client but this of course looks completely different to defense lawyer busch .
" over the past year , the court has not found one piece of evidence that implicates demjanjuk , " he said .
" and even though the court might express the opinion that he is guilty - an opinion is just a belief .
and a belief is no foundation for a verdict in accordance with the rule of law , " he added .
but there is little doubt that demjanjuk was in sobibor .
this view is echoed by cornelius nestler , a law professor who represents relatives of sobibor victims .
to him , one very probing question is whether demjanjuk acted to save himself from the nazi terror .
" but there has been no indication whatsoever to support that , " he said .
demjanjuk was put on trial once before in israel , but that country 's supreme court overturned his conviction of having been a guard at the treblinka camp , ruling that he had been the victim of mistaken identity .
the munich trial is expected to continue until at least march of 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 30.11.2010 european commission opens antitrust probe against google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google could faces fines up to 1.84 billion euros brussels has opened up an inquiry examining the californian company 's dominant position in the eu .
meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .

" without confidentiality , there is no information , no give-and-take , no access , " the paper wrote .

the paper added that it was " a paradox that wikileaks attacks first and foremost democracies and leaves the darkest and most oppressive dictatorships aside . "
madrid-based daily el pais took a different line : " according to the vienna convention , diplomats have the right to gather any information on a country that can be legally obtained .

the disclosures also reveal the demise of us leadership in world politics . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.11.2010 new eurozone crisis mechanism involves private creditors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could be the next eurozone repair site the european stabilization mechanism is the latest effort by nervous eu officials to quell the market turmoil menacing the euro .
a novel feature : calling on private investors to help on a " case by case basis . " european finance ministers had a busy weekend .
first , they agreed to an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 111 billion -rrb- aid package for cash-strapped ireland .
then they threw their support behind a franco-german compromise for resolving debt crises in the eurozone from mid-2013 onward .
financial markets displayed a largely negative reaction on monday to the multibillion-euro rescue package for ireland and the announcement of new rules for dealing with future debt crises .
the weeks ahead will tell whether the measures are enough to quell market fears of contagion spreading to other heavily indebted euro countries , like portugal and spain .
diluted compromise under the agreement announced sunday , the current european financial stability facility – established as an ad hoc measure to support eurozone countries with sovereign debt problems after the greek crisis – will be replaced by the european stabilization mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- , based on a proposal by germany and france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy aim to stabilize the eurozone the compromise dilutes an earlier demand by chancellor angela merkel for investors to " automatically " assume losses and share bailout costs with taxpayers .
wording in the esm agreement now speaks of having private bondholders share the cost of restructuring a eurozone country 's debt on a " case-by-case basis . "
" the sunday agreement aligns europe with the international monetary fund practice that -lrb- involving -rrb- private-sector creditors should be done on a case-by-case basis , " philip lane , a macroeconomics professor at trinity college dublin , told deutsche welle .
" this is sensible since every crisis is different and the appropriate policy response should be calibrated to the details of the crisis . "
although the agreement makes no mention of an " automatic " mechanism for bondholders , experts argue that such an instrument is implied nevertheless .
" in the cases that are likely to appear in the euro area , a high degree of automaticity , which germany sought in the area of sanctions for fiscal transgressions , seems overwhelmingly likely , " said niels christoffer thygesen , a retired economics professor at copenhagen university .
the lack of detail in an earlier franco-german deal on a crisis mechanism , agreed in october , and talk of private investors having to take losses , or " haircuts , " on the value of sovereign bonds , helped drive ireland over the cliff , critics claim .
tough fiscal adjustment program for weeks , european officials have been scrambling to play down possible links between ireland and portugal , which is seen as the next eurozone country at risk – and the possibility that troubles in portugal could quickly spread to spain because of their close economic ties .
under the new two-step plan , a eurozone country with liquidity problems would be able to apply for emergency funding from the esm subject to a tough fiscal adjustment program , without having to restructure its debt or agree to a standstill .
countries whose debt positions are judged by the imf , the european central bank and the european commission as unsustainable would have to enter into negotiations with creditors to restructure its debt as a condition for further bailout funding .
international monetary fund procedures would apply in the esm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf procedures would apply in the new euro stablization scheme the plan has won some praise from the investment community but also raised some concern .
" i think the idea of differentiating between a liquidity and a solvency crisis is a good one in theory , but it will be difficult to distinguish in practice , and the decision will always inevitably be partly political , " said marco annunziata , chief economist of the unicredit group .
" just think how often in the last three years we have been unsure whether banks and governments were illiquid or insolvent . "
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies in brussels , agrees the highly complex esm could be challenging to implement .
" there are no rules for proceeding on a step-by-step basis , " he told deutsche welle .
" this will be extremely difficult and will vary from country to country . "
the permanent crisis resolution mechanism , to be finalized in the weeks ahead , promises a break with several longstanding taboos in the europe union .
for instance , it effectively drops the " no bailout " clause in the eu treaty , accepts for the first time the possibility of a sovereign default in the eurozone and allows for the possibility of making private bondholders share the cost with taxpayers .
" overall , this sends a clear message to private investors to be very careful before lending to governments , " said unicredit 's annunziata .

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .
it has urged the us to deal with the fallout appropriately . " we have seen the reports .
we hope that the us side will properly handle relevant issues , " said foreign ministry spokesman hong lei , refusing to comment on the contents . some of the other disclosed documents have hinted that china could be willing to accept a reunified korea under south korean control .
however , it would not be willing to welcome us troops on northern korean territory were reunification to take place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us suspects china 's top leadership to be behind a hacking campaign against google the relationship between china and its erratic ally is not the only controversial theme in the documents revealed by wikileaks . it would seem that according to certain us officials recent cyber attacks on the search engine google might have been organized by the top chinese leadership . but hong lei refused to comment on this too : " we do n't want to see any disturbance to china-us relations , " he said . little coverage of leaks in chinese media there has not been much talk about the wikileaks revelations in china .

" without confidentiality , there is no information , no give-and-take , no access , " the paper wrote .
" without information , there is also no knowledge , no reasoning powers , no correct decisions .
the usa has been struggling for credibility in the world for years .
wikileaks has turned out to be the weapon of mass destruction for the last ounce of trust . "
" distrust does not only grow among low-ranked informants , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented .
" heads of state have been embarrassed , and the consequences for their countries ' relations towards the states and politicians who had been talking about them are difficult to foresee .
such disclosures could have a much more destructive effect in the world 's trouble spots than in the areas of tension within -lsb- germany 's governing -rsb- coalition . "
france 's daily liberation wrote that a country could not act in a world full of violent conflicts while under constant observation by the public .
the state " has the right to protect its defense secrets , to talk to allies or foes by ensuring confidentiality and to conduct special missions provided that they are suspect to supervision by elected representatives . "
the paper added that it was " a paradox that wikileaks attacks first and foremost democracies and leaves the darkest and most oppressive dictatorships aside . "
madrid-based daily el pais took a different line : " according to the vienna convention , diplomats have the right to gather any information on a country that can be legally obtained .
the recent disclosures do not show that the us has violated the law .
but they do prove that the americans are too prone to secretiveness .
information is kept under lock and key that is in the public interest .
however , transparency is the most important weapon in the fight against arbitrariness and corruption .
the disclosures also reveal the demise of us leadership in world politics . "
the financial times commented that not all information belongs in the public domain .
" in order for states to conduct their affairs effectively , and ensure the security of their citizens , some secrets must remain .
wikileaks ' latest disclosure does not quite cross this line .
but nor does the release of this trove pass the public interest test unequivocally .
the material released so far does not reveal any wrongdoing . "

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

the authorities can now use controversial stolen cds that list alleged evaders . judges of the german constitutional court issued a landmark ruling on tuesday permitting the use of stolen information in cases brought against tax evaders .
the karlsruhe-based court ruled against a german woman 's claim that the investigation into her case was " illegal " because it was based on a stolen cd purchased by germany 's bka intelligence agency in 2008 .
authorities in bochum used information on the disc - containing account information from a bank in the small alpine tax haven of liechtenstein - as grounds to search the woman 's apartment , to which she objected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizens may have more than 23 billion euros in swiss bank accounts the court rejected the claim , ruling instead that such police searches are legal and all evidence obtained through them admissible .
a dangerous precedent ?
despite the financial benefits for the state , tax lawyer jens schmidt of the international law firm white and case is not happy with the decision , mainly because it effectively puts state prosecutors above the law .
" i do n't really see this as a positive development , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's always this consideration in the background - the principle is , state prosecutors are n't allowed to do anything illegal .
but then they do n't draw the conclusion - as you would do for instance under us law - that this makes the whole investigation impermissible . "
but for thomas eigenthaler of the german tax workers union , tax investigators have a duty to get information about tax cheats any way they can .
" tax investigators and tax workers need clarity , " he commented . " as far as we 're concerned - if you can buy the data , you have to buy the data , and the political parties that deny this will gain a reputation for protecting tax evaders . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds may be obtained illegally sudden honesty before tuesday 's ruling , germany 's 16 federal states had been divided over using the data to investigate tax evaders .
but now authorities in all states will be able to prosecute tax evaders , irrespective of how evidence is gathered .
in february , authorities in the state of north-rhine westphalia bought a stolen tax cd for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- containing information on over 1,000 accounts at a swiss bank .
at least six more such cds have since been bought by german authorities , at a cost of several million euros each .
for the state it 's probably very good business : it is estimated the tax man could stand to receive up to a billion euros in back taxes thanks to the cds .
in response , around 20,000 germans turned themselves into the authorities , resulting in surpluses of over one billion euros in government coffers .

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .
it has urged the us to deal with the fallout appropriately . " we have seen the reports .
we hope that the us side will properly handle relevant issues , " said foreign ministry spokesman hong lei , refusing to comment on the contents . some of the other disclosed documents have hinted that china could be willing to accept a reunified korea under south korean control .
however , it would not be willing to welcome us troops on northern korean territory were reunification to take place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us suspects china 's top leadership to be behind a hacking campaign against google the relationship between china and its erratic ally is not the only controversial theme in the documents revealed by wikileaks . it would seem that according to certain us officials recent cyber attacks on the search engine google might have been organized by the top chinese leadership . but hong lei refused to comment on this too : " we do n't want to see any disturbance to china-us relations , " he said . little coverage of leaks in chinese media there has not been much talk about the wikileaks revelations in china .
the wikileaks website is blocked and the chinese media are only allowed to report generally about the leaks .
there has been nothing in the coverage about china or north korea . there is also very little to be found on the internet - a sign that the censors have been deleting user comments and warning internet servers . but one commentator did manage to get around the censors : " respect !

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "

the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .

that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .

" in the coming decade we face the following alternatives : either we reach agreement on missile defense and create a fully-fledged joint mechanism of cooperation , or ... a new round of the arms race will begin , " medvedev said on tuesday .
russia and nato agreed in lisbon earlier this month that they would work together on a new missile defense shield in europe , something russia had previously rejected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama plans to station interceptors on us navy ships demanding equal say medvedev , who has been striking a softer note with the us and europe in recent times and compared to his predecessor vladimir putin , insists that russia to be treated as an equal partner .
but that would imply a level of military and intelligence cooperation never before seen between the former cold war foes .
last september , us president barack obama announced an overhaul of his predecessor 's strategy on the missile shield , which critics said served the sole purpose of appeasing russia , which had been opposed to us plans to build land-based missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic .
those plans were scrapped in favor of interceptors based on us navy ships , designed to fend off missile threats from iran .
touchy topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and medvedev await the ratification of start by us lawmakers missile defense has been a tetchy topic between the us , europe and russia since the 1980s , but the decision to invite russia to participate in the shield was hailed as a breakthrough and seen as concrete evidence that obama is serious about resetting relations with russia .
but the devil is , as so often , in the details and medvedev 's warning of an arms race is a reminder that the particulars of the project still have to be ironed out .
russia is also still waiting for the us senate to ratify the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , signed by medvedev and obama in april .
it 's seen as the centerpiece of improved ties , but some us lawmakers are worried it may weaken us nuclear defenses .

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

fifa had already suspended two executive committee members over similar allegations . a bbc television report and an article in the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper prompted watchdog body transparency international to call for a thorough independent investigation and for thursday 's vote in zurich to be postponed .
" fifa 's integrity and credibility , already shaken in the past , have been badly tarnished and the reputational damage suffered by fifa these last weeks is considerable , " the anti-corruption organization said in a statement .
" the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football world cup must be postponed until all light has been shed on the allegations published in the press .
these have cast such discredit on fifa 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . "
' unpatriotic ' timing the bbc television program " panorama , " which aired on monday night , accused three fifa executives of taking bribes worth millions of dollars .
the three men - ricardo teixera of brazil , african football chief issa hayatou and south america 's nicolas leoz - are alleged to have received secret payments from the international sports and leisure -lrb- isl -rrb- sports marketing firm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations fifa president sepp blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations facing the executives , though in the " panorama " report he had said that all isl officials implicated in the bribery scandal had been exonerated .
meanwhile , officials campaigning for england 's 2018 bid have since lashed out at the bbc for running the report , which they deemed " sensationalist " and ill-timed .
" if -lsb- the bbc -rsb- truly believes there 's a journalistic reason to run this panorama - and that that 's their decision - then they could have done it at any time in the past two years , " england bid chief andy anson said .
" to do it the week before the vote is about one thing - sensationalism .
i do n't think that 's helpful and i do n't think it 's patriotic . "
england is up against favorites russia and the two joint bids from spain / portugal and holland / belgium to host the 2018 world cup .
the 2022 race , also scheduled to be decided in thursday 's vote , sees australia , qatar , japan , south korea and the united states vying for the competition .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .

opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .

hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel being tested contains 50 percent vegetable oil a quarter of the fuel used by the airbus 321 airplanes operating on the route will be composed of a synthetic mixture made from 50 percent vegetable oil .
up to four times more costly than kerosene lufthansa plans to spend 6.6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.7 million -rrb- on the project , estimating that the biofuel will cost three to four times more than kerosene .
project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

" the project to build stuttgart 21 will most probably go ahead , " he said at a stuttgart news conference on tuesday .

supporters say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although around 290 trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
geissler recommended that the areas above the planned underground station be shielded from property speculators by setting up a foundation to handle their redevelopment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 30.11.2010 watchdog calls on fifa to postpone world cup host vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allegations discredit fifa decision-making a watchdog body has demanded that fifa postpone its vote for upcoming world cup hosts and allow an investigation into corruption allegations after media reports said three judges had accepted bribes . world governing soccer body fifa has been forced to confront further allegations of corruption after media reports accused three of its senior members of accepting bribes in exchange for their vote in thursday 's 2018 and 2022 world cup host selection .
fifa had already suspended two executive committee members over similar allegations . a bbc television report and an article in the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper prompted watchdog body transparency international to call for a thorough independent investigation and for thursday 's vote in zurich to be postponed .
" fifa 's integrity and credibility , already shaken in the past , have been badly tarnished and the reputational damage suffered by fifa these last weeks is considerable , " the anti-corruption organization said in a statement .
" the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football world cup must be postponed until all light has been shed on the allegations published in the press .
these have cast such discredit on fifa 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . "
' unpatriotic ' timing the bbc television program " panorama , " which aired on monday night , accused three fifa executives of taking bribes worth millions of dollars .
the three men - ricardo teixera of brazil , african football chief issa hayatou and south america 's nicolas leoz - are alleged to have received secret payments from the international sports and leisure -lrb- isl -rrb- sports marketing firm .

a novel feature : calling on private investors to help on a " case by case basis . " european finance ministers had a busy weekend .
first , they agreed to an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 111 billion -rrb- aid package for cash-strapped ireland .
then they threw their support behind a franco-german compromise for resolving debt crises in the eurozone from mid-2013 onward .
financial markets displayed a largely negative reaction on monday to the multibillion-euro rescue package for ireland and the announcement of new rules for dealing with future debt crises .
the weeks ahead will tell whether the measures are enough to quell market fears of contagion spreading to other heavily indebted euro countries , like portugal and spain .
diluted compromise under the agreement announced sunday , the current european financial stability facility – established as an ad hoc measure to support eurozone countries with sovereign debt problems after the greek crisis – will be replaced by the european stabilization mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- , based on a proposal by germany and france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy aim to stabilize the eurozone the compromise dilutes an earlier demand by chancellor angela merkel for investors to " automatically " assume losses and share bailout costs with taxpayers .
wording in the esm agreement now speaks of having private bondholders share the cost of restructuring a eurozone country 's debt on a " case-by-case basis . "
" the sunday agreement aligns europe with the international monetary fund practice that -lrb- involving -rrb- private-sector creditors should be done on a case-by-case basis , " philip lane , a macroeconomics professor at trinity college dublin , told deutsche welle .
" this is sensible since every crisis is different and the appropriate policy response should be calibrated to the details of the crisis . "
although the agreement makes no mention of an " automatic " mechanism for bondholders , experts argue that such an instrument is implied nevertheless .
" in the cases that are likely to appear in the euro area , a high degree of automaticity , which germany sought in the area of sanctions for fiscal transgressions , seems overwhelmingly likely , " said niels christoffer thygesen , a retired economics professor at copenhagen university .
the lack of detail in an earlier franco-german deal on a crisis mechanism , agreed in october , and talk of private investors having to take losses , or " haircuts , " on the value of sovereign bonds , helped drive ireland over the cliff , critics claim .
tough fiscal adjustment program for weeks , european officials have been scrambling to play down possible links between ireland and portugal , which is seen as the next eurozone country at risk – and the possibility that troubles in portugal could quickly spread to spain because of their close economic ties .
under the new two-step plan , a eurozone country with liquidity problems would be able to apply for emergency funding from the esm subject to a tough fiscal adjustment program , without having to restructure its debt or agree to a standstill .
countries whose debt positions are judged by the imf , the european central bank and the european commission as unsustainable would have to enter into negotiations with creditors to restructure its debt as a condition for further bailout funding .
international monetary fund procedures would apply in the esm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf procedures would apply in the new euro stablization scheme the plan has won some praise from the investment community but also raised some concern .
" i think the idea of differentiating between a liquidity and a solvency crisis is a good one in theory , but it will be difficult to distinguish in practice , and the decision will always inevitably be partly political , " said marco annunziata , chief economist of the unicredit group .
" just think how often in the last three years we have been unsure whether banks and governments were illiquid or insolvent . "
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies in brussels , agrees the highly complex esm could be challenging to implement .
" there are no rules for proceeding on a step-by-step basis , " he told deutsche welle .
" this will be extremely difficult and will vary from country to country . "
the permanent crisis resolution mechanism , to be finalized in the weeks ahead , promises a break with several longstanding taboos in the europe union .
for instance , it effectively drops the " no bailout " clause in the eu treaty , accepts for the first time the possibility of a sovereign default in the eurozone and allows for the possibility of making private bondholders share the cost with taxpayers .
" overall , this sends a clear message to private investors to be very careful before lending to governments , " said unicredit 's annunziata .

the authorities can now use controversial stolen cds that list alleged evaders . judges of the german constitutional court issued a landmark ruling on tuesday permitting the use of stolen information in cases brought against tax evaders .
the karlsruhe-based court ruled against a german woman 's claim that the investigation into her case was " illegal " because it was based on a stolen cd purchased by germany 's bka intelligence agency in 2008 .
authorities in bochum used information on the disc - containing account information from a bank in the small alpine tax haven of liechtenstein - as grounds to search the woman 's apartment , to which she objected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizens may have more than 23 billion euros in swiss bank accounts the court rejected the claim , ruling instead that such police searches are legal and all evidence obtained through them admissible .
a dangerous precedent ?
despite the financial benefits for the state , tax lawyer jens schmidt of the international law firm white and case is not happy with the decision , mainly because it effectively puts state prosecutors above the law .
" i do n't really see this as a positive development , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's always this consideration in the background - the principle is , state prosecutors are n't allowed to do anything illegal .
but then they do n't draw the conclusion - as you would do for instance under us law - that this makes the whole investigation impermissible . "
but for thomas eigenthaler of the german tax workers union , tax investigators have a duty to get information about tax cheats any way they can .
" tax investigators and tax workers need clarity , " he commented . " as far as we 're concerned - if you can buy the data , you have to buy the data , and the political parties that deny this will gain a reputation for protecting tax evaders . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds may be obtained illegally sudden honesty before tuesday 's ruling , germany 's 16 federal states had been divided over using the data to investigate tax evaders .
but now authorities in all states will be able to prosecute tax evaders , irrespective of how evidence is gathered .
in february , authorities in the state of north-rhine westphalia bought a stolen tax cd for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- containing information on over 1,000 accounts at a swiss bank .
at least six more such cds have since been bought by german authorities , at a cost of several million euros each .
for the state it 's probably very good business : it is estimated the tax man could stand to receive up to a billion euros in back taxes thanks to the cds .
in response , around 20,000 germans turned themselves into the authorities , resulting in surpluses of over one billion euros in government coffers .

but as has always been the case , the ultimate decision lies with him - and he is clearly not yet ready to give his verdict . the latest row pitted gadhafi 's pro-reform son saif al-islam against powerful conservatives in the government , ending in another stalemate and continued uncertainty about the oil exporter 's future direction . it began soon after a media group linked to saif al-islam launched a fierce attack on the government .
in apparent retaliation , 20 of the group 's journalists were detained and one of its newspapers was suspended .
the spat only ended when gadhafi intervened personally , and ordered that the journalists be freed . fence sitting the incident illustrates gadhafi 's position in libyan politics as the 68-year-old 's reign enters its final phase .
he stands apparently comfortable in his position as mediator , while political rivals - not least among them some of his sons - begin to vie for his legacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some observers say saif al-islam lacks his father 's charisma and political savvy charles gurdon , libya expert at the london-based political risk consultancy menas associates , said he believes gadhafi is himself caught in a personal struggle between conservatism and reform . " when you look at gadhafi , i think it 's best to think of his heart and his head , " gurdon told deutsche welle .
" at heart , he is still a revolutionary .
for decades he 's been anti-western , has had little interest in the economy , and not a lot of interest in political or economy modernization .
his main interest remains in foreign policy and , in particular , his personal legacy in both the middle east and africa . " but international developments in the last decade have brought out the pragmatist in gadhafi , he said . " his head recognized that a rapprochement with the west , and particularly with the us , was essential in 2003 if libya was to avoid being attacked as iraq was , " gurdon said .
libya was one of the countries in washington 's so-called " axis of evil . " in from the cold as a result , in the past six years , libya has gone from international outcast with a stagnating economy to a bustling country where new office buildings and hotels spring up every month .
foreign businesspeople flock in search of lucrative deals , the largest concerning libya 's rich oil reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is modernizing fast , but needs more infrastructure reform " gadhafi recognized that the oil sector is the economy 's milk cow and that it urgently needed modernization and foreign investment , " gurdon said .
" continuing international sanctions had severely weakened the sector and therefore , there had to be a radical change in policy . " but isabelle werenfels , researcher for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- points out that attracting foreign investment means a lot more than reforming the economy .
western-educated saif al-islam is currently leading a movement that potentially means a wholesale reform of many aspects of libyan society . " the son sees the mid to long-term problems of the country if they do n't embark on economic reforms , but also the modernization of infrastructure , the constitution and education , " werenfels said .
however , gadhafi 's commitment to this is ambiguous , according to gurdon . " with colonel gadhafi , reform is always two steps forward , one step back , " gurdon said .
" but his son recognizes that things need to change in libya , and he 's spearheading the whole movement for a formal constitution , greater democracy , and other reforms which will turn libya into a normal country as we in the west would know it . " winning over the tribes saif al-islam faces much opposition from the old libyan revolutionaries , though .
his lack of military training has meant that he has no constituency in the army or the security services , whereas two of his younger brothers do .
to counter this , saif al-islam has reportedly been travelling around the country hoping to secure the support of some of libya 's all-important tribes . " libya is a very tribal state , and the whole gadhafi system is supported by a number of big tribes that gadhafi united around himself , " werenfels said .
" saif al-islam has been very busy in recent months , travelling to the east , where you have the more rebellious , more marginalized tribes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saif al-islam is hoping to appeal to young libyans granted , saif al-islam is winning popularity among the libyan population , but there are plenty of reasons why gadhafi will not name him as a successor any time soon , for example due to the country 's political structure . libya has a dual political system .
on the one hand , it has a pseudo-direct democratic system , and on the other it has a revolutionary sector made up of committees , informal groups , former comrades of gadhafi , free officer organizations and the security sector .
this second group is extremely powerful and has much to lose if saif al-islam takes over . " i 'm not sure gadhafi can afford to name him as a successor at this point , because there are so many people profiting from the status quo in the elite , " werenfels said . marshalling the endgame on top of this , gadhafi knows that naming saif al-islam as successor would instantly weaken his own position . " as with any leader who 's been in power for over 40 years , you have to work out your endgame , " gurdon said .
" the problem with all of the middle east republics is that , as soon as a successor is nominated , it makes the head of state a lame duck . "
and then there is the old tugging on gadhafi 's revolutionary heart . " libya needs foreign investments - it wants to be part of the international community , " gurdon said .
" at the same time , gadhafi is very reluctant to scrap the political and economic system that he has established and maintained for over 40 years . " but whatever happens , post-gadhafi libya is bound to be profoundly different . " whenever gadhafi eventually goes , i think libya will operate more like a normal country , " gurdon said .
" it is much less likely to be the maverick state it has been in the past . " gadhafi has no official position in the country 's legal system .
he calls himself only the " guide of the revolution . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 30.11.2010 libyan power struggle raises questions about post-gadhafi future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi is torn between his reformer son and his conservative government a recent spat between conservatives and reformers in libya has left leader colonel moammar gadhafi sitting on a fence between his government and his son , who is assembling a tribal coalition behind his reform movement . a new round in an ongoing power struggle between reformers and defenders of the status quo in libya has left gadhafi - who has led the country for over 40 years - in something of a dilemma .
but as has always been the case , the ultimate decision lies with him - and he is clearly not yet ready to give his verdict . the latest row pitted gadhafi 's pro-reform son saif al-islam against powerful conservatives in the government , ending in another stalemate and continued uncertainty about the oil exporter 's future direction . it began soon after a media group linked to saif al-islam launched a fierce attack on the government .
in apparent retaliation , 20 of the group 's journalists were detained and one of its newspapers was suspended .
the spat only ended when gadhafi intervened personally , and ordered that the journalists be freed . fence sitting the incident illustrates gadhafi 's position in libyan politics as the 68-year-old 's reign enters its final phase .
he stands apparently comfortable in his position as mediator , while political rivals - not least among them some of his sons - begin to vie for his legacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some observers say saif al-islam lacks his father 's charisma and political savvy charles gurdon , libya expert at the london-based political risk consultancy menas associates , said he believes gadhafi is himself caught in a personal struggle between conservatism and reform . " when you look at gadhafi , i think it 's best to think of his heart and his head , " gurdon told deutsche welle .
" at heart , he is still a revolutionary .
for decades he 's been anti-western , has had little interest in the economy , and not a lot of interest in political or economy modernization .
his main interest remains in foreign policy and , in particular , his personal legacy in both the middle east and africa . " but international developments in the last decade have brought out the pragmatist in gadhafi , he said . " his head recognized that a rapprochement with the west , and particularly with the us , was essential in 2003 if libya was to avoid being attacked as iraq was , " gurdon said .
libya was one of the countries in washington 's so-called " axis of evil . " in from the cold as a result , in the past six years , libya has gone from international outcast with a stagnating economy to a bustling country where new office buildings and hotels spring up every month .
foreign businesspeople flock in search of lucrative deals , the largest concerning libya 's rich oil reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is modernizing fast , but needs more infrastructure reform " gadhafi recognized that the oil sector is the economy 's milk cow and that it urgently needed modernization and foreign investment , " gurdon said .
" continuing international sanctions had severely weakened the sector and therefore , there had to be a radical change in policy . " but isabelle werenfels , researcher for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- points out that attracting foreign investment means a lot more than reforming the economy .
western-educated saif al-islam is currently leading a movement that potentially means a wholesale reform of many aspects of libyan society . " the son sees the mid to long-term problems of the country if they do n't embark on economic reforms , but also the modernization of infrastructure , the constitution and education , " werenfels said .
however , gadhafi 's commitment to this is ambiguous , according to gurdon . " with colonel gadhafi , reform is always two steps forward , one step back , " gurdon said .
" but his son recognizes that things need to change in libya , and he 's spearheading the whole movement for a formal constitution , greater democracy , and other reforms which will turn libya into a normal country as we in the west would know it . " winning over the tribes saif al-islam faces much opposition from the old libyan revolutionaries , though .

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 30.11.2010 major exhibition brings european enlightenment art to beijing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition features nearly 600 works by european artists and scientists presenting works and ideas from the enlightenment period , the exhibition unveils the visual world of the western pre-modern era .
despite cultural differences , it is expected to generate great public interest in china . one of the world 's most significant enlightenment art exhibitions is due to open at the national museum of china in the spring of 2011 , titled " the art of the enlightenment . "
it comprises nearly 600 exhibits - including paintings , sculptures and even scientific inventions - that originate from the 18th-century western cultural movement which advocated reason as the primary source for legitimacy and authority . it is to be the first exhibition held at the beijing museum 's newly-renovated and expanded facilities - planned by hamburg architectural company gerkan , marg and partners .
the extension to the museum makes it the largest in the world . " the chinese public will appreciate the highly developed painting techniques and the artistic level of german and european artists , " commented huang zhenchun , the national museum 's deputy director . the exhibits are sourced from the berlin state museums collections , the dresden state art collections and the bavarian state picture collections . shaping of a culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich 's works often reflect enlightenment philosophy western art and culture , especially philosophy and science , have been well-received in china .
many works have been translated into chinese , and to this day political and social debates in china are strongly influenced by western thought .
director of the berlin state museums , michael eissenhauer , expects the new exhibition to be met with interest . " we always discover a deep knowledge of literature from this period in our -lsb- chinese -rsb- contacts , " said eissenhauer .
" but this is less true of visual art . " the exhibition aims to present the works in the context of ideological tradition .
for instance , when british painter henry fuseli depicts the battle between sin , satan , and death , it can be seen as a deviation from traditional christian dogma : the interest in evil represents a new-found freedom . likewise , the romantic-style paintings of german painter caspar david friedrich can be interpreted in the context of jean-jacques rousseau 's state-of-nature philosophy , according to klaus schrenk , director of the bavarian state picture collections . " rousseau makes one of the greatest demands on the development of humankind and questions the absolute power of french kings , " said schrenk .
similarly , friedrich 's works also represent mankind 's natural right to self-determination , he added . a discussion program between german and chinese scholars will help the public understand these parallels better .
the german federal foreign office , a co-sponsor , sees a political side of the exhibition . " -lsb- german philosopher -rsb- kant translated the ' sapere aude ' maxim of -lsb- roman -rsb- poet horace as ' have courage to use your own understanding , " ' said werner wnendt , head of the directorate-general for culture and communication at the federal foreign office .
" this motto of the enlightenment calls for politics to take this seriously and to allow the use of reasoning . " politics ' not the task of museums ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlightenment art questions old beliefs traditions the exhibition comes at a time when the values associated with the european enlightenment are a subject of heated debate .
the awarding of the nobel peace prize to chinese dissident writer liu xiaobo has once again attracted international attention to the topic of freedom of speech in china . one of the core concepts that emerged from the enlightenment - the idea that certain values are universal - has been intensely discussed in chinese intellectual circles in recent months .
however , according to eissenhauer , the art exhibition will not feature any references to current political ideology , which he believes is a matter for the foreign ministry , but " not the task of art museums . " the exhibition was meant to have opened this year , but was postponed due to delays in the museum building project .
the works are scheduled to remain in beijing for 15 months , with no other locations in china involved . author : mathias boelinger -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a novel feature : calling on private investors to help on a " case by case basis . " european finance ministers had a busy weekend .
first , they agreed to an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 111 billion -rrb- aid package for cash-strapped ireland .
then they threw their support behind a franco-german compromise for resolving debt crises in the eurozone from mid-2013 onward .
financial markets displayed a largely negative reaction on monday to the multibillion-euro rescue package for ireland and the announcement of new rules for dealing with future debt crises .
the weeks ahead will tell whether the measures are enough to quell market fears of contagion spreading to other heavily indebted euro countries , like portugal and spain .
diluted compromise under the agreement announced sunday , the current european financial stability facility – established as an ad hoc measure to support eurozone countries with sovereign debt problems after the greek crisis – will be replaced by the european stabilization mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- , based on a proposal by germany and france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy aim to stabilize the eurozone the compromise dilutes an earlier demand by chancellor angela merkel for investors to " automatically " assume losses and share bailout costs with taxpayers .
wording in the esm agreement now speaks of having private bondholders share the cost of restructuring a eurozone country 's debt on a " case-by-case basis . "
" the sunday agreement aligns europe with the international monetary fund practice that -lrb- involving -rrb- private-sector creditors should be done on a case-by-case basis , " philip lane , a macroeconomics professor at trinity college dublin , told deutsche welle .
" this is sensible since every crisis is different and the appropriate policy response should be calibrated to the details of the crisis . "
although the agreement makes no mention of an " automatic " mechanism for bondholders , experts argue that such an instrument is implied nevertheless .
" in the cases that are likely to appear in the euro area , a high degree of automaticity , which germany sought in the area of sanctions for fiscal transgressions , seems overwhelmingly likely , " said niels christoffer thygesen , a retired economics professor at copenhagen university .
the lack of detail in an earlier franco-german deal on a crisis mechanism , agreed in october , and talk of private investors having to take losses , or " haircuts , " on the value of sovereign bonds , helped drive ireland over the cliff , critics claim .
tough fiscal adjustment program for weeks , european officials have been scrambling to play down possible links between ireland and portugal , which is seen as the next eurozone country at risk – and the possibility that troubles in portugal could quickly spread to spain because of their close economic ties .
under the new two-step plan , a eurozone country with liquidity problems would be able to apply for emergency funding from the esm subject to a tough fiscal adjustment program , without having to restructure its debt or agree to a standstill .
countries whose debt positions are judged by the imf , the european central bank and the european commission as unsustainable would have to enter into negotiations with creditors to restructure its debt as a condition for further bailout funding .
international monetary fund procedures would apply in the esm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf procedures would apply in the new euro stablization scheme the plan has won some praise from the investment community but also raised some concern .
" i think the idea of differentiating between a liquidity and a solvency crisis is a good one in theory , but it will be difficult to distinguish in practice , and the decision will always inevitably be partly political , " said marco annunziata , chief economist of the unicredit group .
" just think how often in the last three years we have been unsure whether banks and governments were illiquid or insolvent . "
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies in brussels , agrees the highly complex esm could be challenging to implement .
" there are no rules for proceeding on a step-by-step basis , " he told deutsche welle .
" this will be extremely difficult and will vary from country to country . "
the permanent crisis resolution mechanism , to be finalized in the weeks ahead , promises a break with several longstanding taboos in the europe union .
for instance , it effectively drops the " no bailout " clause in the eu treaty , accepts for the first time the possibility of a sovereign default in the eurozone and allows for the possibility of making private bondholders share the cost with taxpayers .
" overall , this sends a clear message to private investors to be very careful before lending to governments , " said unicredit 's annunziata .

" without confidentiality , there is no information , no give-and-take , no access , " the paper wrote .
" without information , there is also no knowledge , no reasoning powers , no correct decisions .
the usa has been struggling for credibility in the world for years .
wikileaks has turned out to be the weapon of mass destruction for the last ounce of trust . "

the state " has the right to protect its defense secrets , to talk to allies or foes by ensuring confidentiality and to conduct special missions provided that they are suspect to supervision by elected representatives . "
the paper added that it was " a paradox that wikileaks attacks first and foremost democracies and leaves the darkest and most oppressive dictatorships aside . "
madrid-based daily el pais took a different line : " according to the vienna convention , diplomats have the right to gather any information on a country that can be legally obtained .
the recent disclosures do not show that the us has violated the law .
but they do prove that the americans are too prone to secretiveness .

however , transparency is the most important weapon in the fight against arbitrariness and corruption .
the disclosures also reveal the demise of us leadership in world politics . "

the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .
it has urged the us to deal with the fallout appropriately . " we have seen the reports .

the carrier hopes to make inroads into cutting the size of its carbon footprint . germany 's national air carrier lufthansa said on monday it would start to test the use of biofuel to supplement kerosene on one of its major domestic flights .
the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel being tested contains 50 percent vegetable oil a quarter of the fuel used by the airbus 321 airplanes operating on the route will be composed of a synthetic mixture made from 50 percent vegetable oil .
up to four times more costly than kerosene lufthansa plans to spend 6.6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.7 million -rrb- on the project , estimating that the biofuel will cost three to four times more than kerosene .
project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?

" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .

" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

geissler , who is a former secretary-general of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the project should continue , but that germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn , should agree to " decisive changes . "
" the project to build stuttgart 21 will most probably go ahead , " he said at a stuttgart news conference on tuesday .
he pointed out that stuttgart 21 already has planning permission , unlike the plans for modernization of the existing station , favored by critics of the underground railway .
abandoning the project would also be too expensive , geissler argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler led nine rounds of mediation talks controversial project stuttgart 21 divided the community in stuttgart , with thousands of supporters and opponents taking to the streets before the mediation talks started .
opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although around 290 trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
geissler recommended that the areas above the planned underground station be shielded from property speculators by setting up a foundation to handle their redevelopment .
he also asked deutsche bahn to improve the security aspects of the project .
stefan mappus , the premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , welcomed the recommendations .
" we want to face up to this stress test , because we think it 's only fair that we openly discuss what the strengths and weaknesses of this project are , and to get rid of the weaknesses , " he said on tuesday .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "

" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

fifa had already suspended two executive committee members over similar allegations . a bbc television report and an article in the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper prompted watchdog body transparency international to call for a thorough independent investigation and for thursday 's vote in zurich to be postponed .
" fifa 's integrity and credibility , already shaken in the past , have been badly tarnished and the reputational damage suffered by fifa these last weeks is considerable , " the anti-corruption organization said in a statement .
" the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football world cup must be postponed until all light has been shed on the allegations published in the press .
these have cast such discredit on fifa 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . "
' unpatriotic ' timing the bbc television program " panorama , " which aired on monday night , accused three fifa executives of taking bribes worth millions of dollars .
the three men - ricardo teixera of brazil , african football chief issa hayatou and south america 's nicolas leoz - are alleged to have received secret payments from the international sports and leisure -lrb- isl -rrb- sports marketing firm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations fifa president sepp blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations facing the executives , though in the " panorama " report he had said that all isl officials implicated in the bribery scandal had been exonerated .
meanwhile , officials campaigning for england 's 2018 bid have since lashed out at the bbc for running the report , which they deemed " sensationalist " and ill-timed .
" if -lsb- the bbc -rsb- truly believes there 's a journalistic reason to run this panorama - and that that 's their decision - then they could have done it at any time in the past two years , " england bid chief andy anson said .
" to do it the week before the vote is about one thing - sensationalism .
i do n't think that 's helpful and i do n't think it 's patriotic . "
england is up against favorites russia and the two joint bids from spain / portugal and holland / belgium to host the 2018 world cup .
the 2022 race , also scheduled to be decided in thursday 's vote , sees australia , qatar , japan , south korea and the united states vying for the competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

fifa had already suspended two executive committee members over similar allegations . a bbc television report and an article in the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper prompted watchdog body transparency international to call for a thorough independent investigation and for thursday 's vote in zurich to be postponed .
" fifa 's integrity and credibility , already shaken in the past , have been badly tarnished and the reputational damage suffered by fifa these last weeks is considerable , " the anti-corruption organization said in a statement .
" the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football world cup must be postponed until all light has been shed on the allegations published in the press .
these have cast such discredit on fifa 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . "
' unpatriotic ' timing the bbc television program " panorama , " which aired on monday night , accused three fifa executives of taking bribes worth millions of dollars .
the three men - ricardo teixera of brazil , african football chief issa hayatou and south america 's nicolas leoz - are alleged to have received secret payments from the international sports and leisure -lrb- isl -rrb- sports marketing firm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations fifa president sepp blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations facing the executives , though in the " panorama " report he had said that all isl officials implicated in the bribery scandal had been exonerated .
meanwhile , officials campaigning for england 's 2018 bid have since lashed out at the bbc for running the report , which they deemed " sensationalist " and ill-timed .
" if -lsb- the bbc -rsb- truly believes there 's a journalistic reason to run this panorama - and that that 's their decision - then they could have done it at any time in the past two years , " england bid chief andy anson said .
" to do it the week before the vote is about one thing - sensationalism .
i do n't think that 's helpful and i do n't think it 's patriotic . "
england is up against favorites russia and the two joint bids from spain / portugal and holland / belgium to host the 2018 world cup .
the 2022 race , also scheduled to be decided in thursday 's vote , sees australia , qatar , japan , south korea and the united states vying for the competition .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner viviane reding called again for " the right to be forgotten " online " take the example of google street view and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured wifi networks , " she said in the speech .
" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .

" without confidentiality , there is no information , no give-and-take , no access , " the paper wrote .

the usa has been struggling for credibility in the world for years .
wikileaks has turned out to be the weapon of mass destruction for the last ounce of trust . "

despite cultural differences , it is expected to generate great public interest in china . one of the world 's most significant enlightenment art exhibitions is due to open at the national museum of china in the spring of 2011 , titled " the art of the enlightenment . "
it comprises nearly 600 exhibits - including paintings , sculptures and even scientific inventions - that originate from the 18th-century western cultural movement which advocated reason as the primary source for legitimacy and authority . it is to be the first exhibition held at the beijing museum 's newly-renovated and expanded facilities - planned by hamburg architectural company gerkan , marg and partners .
the extension to the museum makes it the largest in the world . " the chinese public will appreciate the highly developed painting techniques and the artistic level of german and european artists , " commented huang zhenchun , the national museum 's deputy director . the exhibits are sourced from the berlin state museums collections , the dresden state art collections and the bavarian state picture collections . shaping of a culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich 's works often reflect enlightenment philosophy western art and culture , especially philosophy and science , have been well-received in china .
many works have been translated into chinese , and to this day political and social debates in china are strongly influenced by western thought .
director of the berlin state museums , michael eissenhauer , expects the new exhibition to be met with interest . " we always discover a deep knowledge of literature from this period in our -lsb- chinese -rsb- contacts , " said eissenhauer .
" but this is less true of visual art . " the exhibition aims to present the works in the context of ideological tradition .
for instance , when british painter henry fuseli depicts the battle between sin , satan , and death , it can be seen as a deviation from traditional christian dogma : the interest in evil represents a new-found freedom . likewise , the romantic-style paintings of german painter caspar david friedrich can be interpreted in the context of jean-jacques rousseau 's state-of-nature philosophy , according to klaus schrenk , director of the bavarian state picture collections . " rousseau makes one of the greatest demands on the development of humankind and questions the absolute power of french kings , " said schrenk .
similarly , friedrich 's works also represent mankind 's natural right to self-determination , he added . a discussion program between german and chinese scholars will help the public understand these parallels better .
the german federal foreign office , a co-sponsor , sees a political side of the exhibition . " -lsb- german philosopher -rsb- kant translated the ' sapere aude ' maxim of -lsb- roman -rsb- poet horace as ' have courage to use your own understanding , " ' said werner wnendt , head of the directorate-general for culture and communication at the federal foreign office .
" this motto of the enlightenment calls for politics to take this seriously and to allow the use of reasoning . " politics ' not the task of museums ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlightenment art questions old beliefs traditions the exhibition comes at a time when the values associated with the european enlightenment are a subject of heated debate .
the awarding of the nobel peace prize to chinese dissident writer liu xiaobo has once again attracted international attention to the topic of freedom of speech in china . one of the core concepts that emerged from the enlightenment - the idea that certain values are universal - has been intensely discussed in chinese intellectual circles in recent months .
however , according to eissenhauer , the art exhibition will not feature any references to current political ideology , which he believes is a matter for the foreign ministry , but " not the task of art museums . " the exhibition was meant to have opened this year , but was postponed due to delays in the museum building project .

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.11.2010 new eurozone crisis mechanism involves private creditors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal could be the next eurozone repair site the european stabilization mechanism is the latest effort by nervous eu officials to quell the market turmoil menacing the euro .
a novel feature : calling on private investors to help on a " case by case basis . " european finance ministers had a busy weekend .
first , they agreed to an 85-billion-euro -lrb- $ 111 billion -rrb- aid package for cash-strapped ireland .
then they threw their support behind a franco-german compromise for resolving debt crises in the eurozone from mid-2013 onward .
financial markets displayed a largely negative reaction on monday to the multibillion-euro rescue package for ireland and the announcement of new rules for dealing with future debt crises .
the weeks ahead will tell whether the measures are enough to quell market fears of contagion spreading to other heavily indebted euro countries , like portugal and spain .
diluted compromise under the agreement announced sunday , the current european financial stability facility – established as an ad hoc measure to support eurozone countries with sovereign debt problems after the greek crisis – will be replaced by the european stabilization mechanism -lrb- esm -rrb- , based on a proposal by germany and france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy aim to stabilize the eurozone the compromise dilutes an earlier demand by chancellor angela merkel for investors to " automatically " assume losses and share bailout costs with taxpayers .
wording in the esm agreement now speaks of having private bondholders share the cost of restructuring a eurozone country 's debt on a " case-by-case basis . "
" the sunday agreement aligns europe with the international monetary fund practice that -lrb- involving -rrb- private-sector creditors should be done on a case-by-case basis , " philip lane , a macroeconomics professor at trinity college dublin , told deutsche welle .
" this is sensible since every crisis is different and the appropriate policy response should be calibrated to the details of the crisis . "
although the agreement makes no mention of an " automatic " mechanism for bondholders , experts argue that such an instrument is implied nevertheless .
" in the cases that are likely to appear in the euro area , a high degree of automaticity , which germany sought in the area of sanctions for fiscal transgressions , seems overwhelmingly likely , " said niels christoffer thygesen , a retired economics professor at copenhagen university .
the lack of detail in an earlier franco-german deal on a crisis mechanism , agreed in october , and talk of private investors having to take losses , or " haircuts , " on the value of sovereign bonds , helped drive ireland over the cliff , critics claim .
tough fiscal adjustment program for weeks , european officials have been scrambling to play down possible links between ireland and portugal , which is seen as the next eurozone country at risk – and the possibility that troubles in portugal could quickly spread to spain because of their close economic ties .
under the new two-step plan , a eurozone country with liquidity problems would be able to apply for emergency funding from the esm subject to a tough fiscal adjustment program , without having to restructure its debt or agree to a standstill .
countries whose debt positions are judged by the imf , the european central bank and the european commission as unsustainable would have to enter into negotiations with creditors to restructure its debt as a condition for further bailout funding .
international monetary fund procedures would apply in the esm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf procedures would apply in the new euro stablization scheme the plan has won some praise from the investment community but also raised some concern .
" i think the idea of differentiating between a liquidity and a solvency crisis is a good one in theory , but it will be difficult to distinguish in practice , and the decision will always inevitably be partly political , " said marco annunziata , chief economist of the unicredit group .
" just think how often in the last three years we have been unsure whether banks and governments were illiquid or insolvent . "
karel lannoo , chief executive officer of the centre for european policy studies in brussels , agrees the highly complex esm could be challenging to implement .
" there are no rules for proceeding on a step-by-step basis , " he told deutsche welle .
" this will be extremely difficult and will vary from country to country . "
the permanent crisis resolution mechanism , to be finalized in the weeks ahead , promises a break with several longstanding taboos in the europe union .
for instance , it effectively drops the " no bailout " clause in the eu treaty , accepts for the first time the possibility of a sovereign default in the eurozone and allows for the possibility of making private bondholders share the cost with taxpayers .
" overall , this sends a clear message to private investors to be very careful before lending to governments , " said unicredit 's annunziata .

the authorities can now use controversial stolen cds that list alleged evaders . judges of the german constitutional court issued a landmark ruling on tuesday permitting the use of stolen information in cases brought against tax evaders .
the karlsruhe-based court ruled against a german woman 's claim that the investigation into her case was " illegal " because it was based on a stolen cd purchased by germany 's bka intelligence agency in 2008 .
authorities in bochum used information on the disc - containing account information from a bank in the small alpine tax haven of liechtenstein - as grounds to search the woman 's apartment , to which she objected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizens may have more than 23 billion euros in swiss bank accounts the court rejected the claim , ruling instead that such police searches are legal and all evidence obtained through them admissible .
a dangerous precedent ?
despite the financial benefits for the state , tax lawyer jens schmidt of the international law firm white and case is not happy with the decision , mainly because it effectively puts state prosecutors above the law .
" i do n't really see this as a positive development , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's always this consideration in the background - the principle is , state prosecutors are n't allowed to do anything illegal .
but then they do n't draw the conclusion - as you would do for instance under us law - that this makes the whole investigation impermissible . "
but for thomas eigenthaler of the german tax workers union , tax investigators have a duty to get information about tax cheats any way they can .
" tax investigators and tax workers need clarity , " he commented . " as far as we 're concerned - if you can buy the data , you have to buy the data , and the political parties that deny this will gain a reputation for protecting tax evaders . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds may be obtained illegally sudden honesty before tuesday 's ruling , germany 's 16 federal states had been divided over using the data to investigate tax evaders .
but now authorities in all states will be able to prosecute tax evaders , irrespective of how evidence is gathered .
in february , authorities in the state of north-rhine westphalia bought a stolen tax cd for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- containing information on over 1,000 accounts at a swiss bank .
at least six more such cds have since been bought by german authorities , at a cost of several million euros each .
for the state it 's probably very good business : it is estimated the tax man could stand to receive up to a billion euros in back taxes thanks to the cds .
in response , around 20,000 germans turned themselves into the authorities , resulting in surpluses of over one billion euros in government coffers .

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .

" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

" in the coming decade we face the following alternatives : either we reach agreement on missile defense and create a fully-fledged joint mechanism of cooperation , or ... a new round of the arms race will begin , " medvedev said on tuesday .
russia and nato agreed in lisbon earlier this month that they would work together on a new missile defense shield in europe , something russia had previously rejected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama plans to station interceptors on us navy ships demanding equal say medvedev , who has been striking a softer note with the us and europe in recent times and compared to his predecessor vladimir putin , insists that russia to be treated as an equal partner .
but that would imply a level of military and intelligence cooperation never before seen between the former cold war foes .
last september , us president barack obama announced an overhaul of his predecessor 's strategy on the missile shield , which critics said served the sole purpose of appeasing russia , which had been opposed to us plans to build land-based missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic .
those plans were scrapped in favor of interceptors based on us navy ships , designed to fend off missile threats from iran .
touchy topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and medvedev await the ratification of start by us lawmakers missile defense has been a tetchy topic between the us , europe and russia since the 1980s , but the decision to invite russia to participate in the shield was hailed as a breakthrough and seen as concrete evidence that obama is serious about resetting relations with russia .
but the devil is , as so often , in the details and medvedev 's warning of an arms race is a reminder that the particulars of the project still have to be ironed out .
russia is also still waiting for the us senate to ratify the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , signed by medvedev and obama in april .
it 's seen as the centerpiece of improved ties , but some us lawmakers are worried it may weaken us nuclear defenses .

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .
it has urged the us to deal with the fallout appropriately . " we have seen the reports .
we hope that the us side will properly handle relevant issues , " said foreign ministry spokesman hong lei , refusing to comment on the contents . some of the other disclosed documents have hinted that china could be willing to accept a reunified korea under south korean control .

the wikileaks website is blocked and the chinese media are only allowed to report generally about the leaks .
there has been nothing in the coverage about china or north korea . there is also very little to be found on the internet - a sign that the censors have been deleting user comments and warning internet servers . but one commentator did manage to get around the censors : " respect !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 30.11.2010 the demjanjuk trial one year on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk is accused of helping to kill 28,000 jews the trial against john demjanjuk , who is accused of helping to murder about 28,000 jews at the sobibor death camp in 1943 , has been going on for a year now .
but to date , no real progress has been made . it has been one year since the beginning of the trial against john demjanjuk , who is accused of helping to murder about 28,000 jews at the sobibor death camp .
the 90-year-old demjanjuk has denied the charges .
demjanjuk 's case might be the last major holocaust trial in germany .
the trial has made little progress since it opened on november 30 , 2009 .
one of the main problems has been a series of interruptions , said barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the public prosecutors ' office in munich .
" there have been days during the presentation of evidence in which no progress has been made due to motions being filed or other interruptions , " she said .
" if we could have operated more efficiently , we would have gotten much further or maybe even finished it . "
due to demjanjuk 's poor health -lrb- he suffers from low hemoglobin blood levels -rrb- , the court can only meet for about three hours a day .
demjanjuk follows the hearings from a hospital bed in the courtroom where he sometimes nods off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk has been known to doze off during the hearings " i think the defendant is sleeping , " public prosecutors attorney hans-joachim lutz recently told magistrate ralph alt during a court hearing .
in addition to that , demjanjuk 's lawyer , ulrich busch has been accused of purposely trying to delay the trial by recycling evidence , which was previously rejected .
at the start of the trial , busch accused the judges of being biased against his client .
on some occasions , the hearings have degenerated into shouting matches between busch and the presiding judge , ralph alt .
" not a perpetrator but a victim " according to busch , demjanjuk regards himself not as a perpetrator but as a victim .
" he still sees himself as a prisoner of war , he views the proceedings as a form of torture , " he said .
" of course he also gets owerwhelmed because of his mental health , he is in total despair . "
demjanjuk was born in ukraine and was first taken prisoner of war by the nazis . barbara stockinger , the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office , said that the evidence provided so far does show that demjanjuk committed the crimes he is accused of .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense lawyer busch says there is no evidence against his client but this of course looks completely different to defense lawyer busch .
" over the past year , the court has not found one piece of evidence that implicates demjanjuk , " he said .
" and even though the court might express the opinion that he is guilty - an opinion is just a belief .
and a belief is no foundation for a verdict in accordance with the rule of law , " he added .
but there is little doubt that demjanjuk was in sobibor .
this view is echoed by cornelius nestler , a law professor who represents relatives of sobibor victims .
to him , one very probing question is whether demjanjuk acted to save himself from the nazi terror .
" but there has been no indication whatsoever to support that , " he said .
demjanjuk was put on trial once before in israel , but that country 's supreme court overturned his conviction of having been a guard at the treblinka camp , ruling that he had been the victim of mistaken identity .
the munich trial is expected to continue until at least march of 2011 .

geissler , who is a former secretary-general of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the project should continue , but that germany 's railway company , deutsche bahn , should agree to " decisive changes . "
" the project to build stuttgart 21 will most probably go ahead , " he said at a stuttgart news conference on tuesday .
he pointed out that stuttgart 21 already has planning permission , unlike the plans for modernization of the existing station , favored by critics of the underground railway .
abandoning the project would also be too expensive , geissler argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler led nine rounds of mediation talks controversial project stuttgart 21 divided the community in stuttgart , with thousands of supporters and opponents taking to the streets before the mediation talks started .
opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although around 290 trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
geissler recommended that the areas above the planned underground station be shielded from property speculators by setting up a foundation to handle their redevelopment .
he also asked deutsche bahn to improve the security aspects of the project .
stefan mappus , the premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where stuttgart is located , welcomed the recommendations .
" we want to face up to this stress test , because we think it 's only fair that we openly discuss what the strengths and weaknesses of this project are , and to get rid of the weaknesses , " he said on tuesday .

now , the focus is on new irrigation practices to help save the limited resource . the population of the souss-massa river basin , a narrow depression between the high-atlas mountains to the north and the anti-atlas to the south , has traditionally lived from agriculture , growing mainly grain and cattle feed .
but many of the wells that small-scale farmers in the region have traditionally used to irrigate their fields , have started to run dry . one reason for this is that their water resources are being siphoned off by the greenhouses and pump systems employed by major agricultural players in the region .
" many farmers have lost their livelihoods because the groundwater is being pumped away , " explains juergen graebener from the german company eco consult , based in morocco .
" the result is that the groundwater level has sunk so low that they ca n't get to it with their traditional wells . "
and with the groundwater level dropping three meters each year , the situation in the region is hardly likely to improve .
irrigation challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforestation of argan trees , a species native to morocco , can help stem soil erosion in the past , farmers did n't need to burrow further than 10 meters into the ground to reach water .
but today , irrigating their fields has become increasingly challenging .
the water table has plummeted to such an extent that only major farming companies have the technology necessary to extract water .
in this very dry region , reservoirs run dry even before the end of the season , and the water supply is insufficient to meet the needs of intensive farming .
the last 30 years have seen intensive farming practices adopted across morocco , as the country has adjusted to the demands of the global economy by lifting import barriers and scaling back its subsidy system .
" large-scale farming in greenhouses provides morocco with its main exports , and is the leading economy in the region , " says juergen graebener .
some 700,000 tons of vegetables are produced in the souss-massa basin annually , a large part of which is exported to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initiatives to help protect natural resources help to improve the quality of products and raise local incomes but small farmers have n't benefitted .
in the last few years , many of them have protested against developments in large-scale farming and its impact on their own livelihoods .
their depleted water supply is only part of the problem .
those who have no choice but to give up their own land are forced to earn their living as a farmhand – work that 's badly paid .
in the long run , the future looks anything but rosy for farmers in the region . the moroccan government is planning to push development in the souss-massa region over the new few years , turning it into one of the country 's most productive farming centers that can hold its own on the global market .
high-tech versus tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targetted planting of trees is aimed at producing more water but that 's a difficult goal to acheive without improving water availability . to that effect , the government plans to improve water resources management by promoting the efficient and sustainable use of forest , soil , and water .
that includes switching from growing grain to olive trees on 52,000 hectares of land , which makes sense because olive trees need less water .
moreover , morocco is increasingly looking towards seawater desalination as a source to supply its increasing water needs .
the key is modern technology .
" producing more water is the goal , “ says graebener .
" two desalination plants are foreseen , and a series of small and medium-sized dams are to be built . "
in order to ensure their livelihoods despite the large plants , many small farmers already use a drip irrigation system , a practice adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity , which saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants , either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone .
while experts agree that the region needs modern technology to remain economically stable , they also maintain that tradition has a role to play too . graebener says the situation is comparable to the debate on nuclear energy in germany .
" there 's no alternative for the time being , but in the long run , we need to see how we can move away from it , " he says .
until then , he hopes that not all traditional wells in morocco will have run dry . time is running out for small farmers to adapt to a sustainable use of their water resources .

but as has always been the case , the ultimate decision lies with him - and he is clearly not yet ready to give his verdict . the latest row pitted gadhafi 's pro-reform son saif al-islam against powerful conservatives in the government , ending in another stalemate and continued uncertainty about the oil exporter 's future direction . it began soon after a media group linked to saif al-islam launched a fierce attack on the government .
in apparent retaliation , 20 of the group 's journalists were detained and one of its newspapers was suspended .
the spat only ended when gadhafi intervened personally , and ordered that the journalists be freed . fence sitting the incident illustrates gadhafi 's position in libyan politics as the 68-year-old 's reign enters its final phase .
he stands apparently comfortable in his position as mediator , while political rivals - not least among them some of his sons - begin to vie for his legacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some observers say saif al-islam lacks his father 's charisma and political savvy charles gurdon , libya expert at the london-based political risk consultancy menas associates , said he believes gadhafi is himself caught in a personal struggle between conservatism and reform . " when you look at gadhafi , i think it 's best to think of his heart and his head , " gurdon told deutsche welle .
" at heart , he is still a revolutionary .
for decades he 's been anti-western , has had little interest in the economy , and not a lot of interest in political or economy modernization .
his main interest remains in foreign policy and , in particular , his personal legacy in both the middle east and africa . " but international developments in the last decade have brought out the pragmatist in gadhafi , he said . " his head recognized that a rapprochement with the west , and particularly with the us , was essential in 2003 if libya was to avoid being attacked as iraq was , " gurdon said .
libya was one of the countries in washington 's so-called " axis of evil . " in from the cold as a result , in the past six years , libya has gone from international outcast with a stagnating economy to a bustling country where new office buildings and hotels spring up every month .
foreign businesspeople flock in search of lucrative deals , the largest concerning libya 's rich oil reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is modernizing fast , but needs more infrastructure reform " gadhafi recognized that the oil sector is the economy 's milk cow and that it urgently needed modernization and foreign investment , " gurdon said .
" continuing international sanctions had severely weakened the sector and therefore , there had to be a radical change in policy . " but isabelle werenfels , researcher for the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- points out that attracting foreign investment means a lot more than reforming the economy .
western-educated saif al-islam is currently leading a movement that potentially means a wholesale reform of many aspects of libyan society . " the son sees the mid to long-term problems of the country if they do n't embark on economic reforms , but also the modernization of infrastructure , the constitution and education , " werenfels said .
however , gadhafi 's commitment to this is ambiguous , according to gurdon . " with colonel gadhafi , reform is always two steps forward , one step back , " gurdon said .
" but his son recognizes that things need to change in libya , and he 's spearheading the whole movement for a formal constitution , greater democracy , and other reforms which will turn libya into a normal country as we in the west would know it . " winning over the tribes saif al-islam faces much opposition from the old libyan revolutionaries , though .
his lack of military training has meant that he has no constituency in the army or the security services , whereas two of his younger brothers do .
to counter this , saif al-islam has reportedly been travelling around the country hoping to secure the support of some of libya 's all-important tribes . " libya is a very tribal state , and the whole gadhafi system is supported by a number of big tribes that gadhafi united around himself , " werenfels said .
" saif al-islam has been very busy in recent months , travelling to the east , where you have the more rebellious , more marginalized tribes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saif al-islam is hoping to appeal to young libyans granted , saif al-islam is winning popularity among the libyan population , but there are plenty of reasons why gadhafi will not name him as a successor any time soon , for example due to the country 's political structure . libya has a dual political system .
on the one hand , it has a pseudo-direct democratic system , and on the other it has a revolutionary sector made up of committees , informal groups , former comrades of gadhafi , free officer organizations and the security sector .
this second group is extremely powerful and has much to lose if saif al-islam takes over . " i 'm not sure gadhafi can afford to name him as a successor at this point , because there are so many people profiting from the status quo in the elite , " werenfels said . marshalling the endgame on top of this , gadhafi knows that naming saif al-islam as successor would instantly weaken his own position . " as with any leader who 's been in power for over 40 years , you have to work out your endgame , " gurdon said .
" the problem with all of the middle east republics is that , as soon as a successor is nominated , it makes the head of state a lame duck . "
and then there is the old tugging on gadhafi 's revolutionary heart . " libya needs foreign investments - it wants to be part of the international community , " gurdon said .
" at the same time , gadhafi is very reluctant to scrap the political and economic system that he has established and maintained for over 40 years . " but whatever happens , post-gadhafi libya is bound to be profoundly different . " whenever gadhafi eventually goes , i think libya will operate more like a normal country , " gurdon said .
" it is much less likely to be the maverick state it has been in the past . " gadhafi has no official position in the country 's legal system .
he calls himself only the " guide of the revolution . "
if nothing else , it is unlikely that any successor will occupy a similarly unique position above and outside the libyan system .
this in itself will be an irreversible reform . author : ben knight editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now they 're back with a new album and a new sound . with hits like " perfekte welle " -lrb- perfect wave -rrb- and " geile zeit " -lrb- great time -rrb- , five-piece band juli helped usher in a new wave of german-language pop rock .
in october 2010 , their third album , " in love , " debuted at number four on the german charts .
singer eva briegel and guitarist jonas pfetzing spoke to deutsche welle about digital jamming sessions , managing the merry-go-round of stardom , and juggling kids and concerts . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio ’ s hits in germany , featuring german band juli . deutsche welle : why did it take four years for juli to release its third album , " in love " ? eva briegel : after our second record we were on tour for about three-quarters of a year .
after that we took a break , with each of us devoting more time to our private lives .
we all moved to different cities and took some time to get our bearings .
about three years ago we started exchanging sketches for songs and talking about what an album might look like if we were to want to make another one .
a year and a half ago we were back in the studio . jonas pfetzing : we were never the quickest bunch when it comes to writing .
but being out of the public eye was incredibly important for each of us - to assess who we are as individuals outside of the band .
we asked ourselves what we want out of life : do we want this ?
ultimately you come to the realization that you do n't really need it - you do n't pin your happiness on whether you 're getting publicity or not .
i think it was one of the smartest decisions we 've ever made as a band .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the band hails from a small university town in western germany , called giessen it sounds like the group needed time to digest its initial overwhelming success . pfetzing : we had to let it sink in and understand everything that happened .
we were kind of steamrollered by success .
there comes a point when you have to process it .
for us it was important to come to the decision that we would n't simply stick to the formula that brought us commercial success and keep doing that for the next 20 years . it was all wonderful , but has nothing to do with who we are right now .
so in some ways , this felt like a debut album .
at least we tried to generate that frame of mind by saying , " we do n't exist ; we 're in the process of finding ourselves . " do you think that 's necessary for a band to progress musically ?
briegel : if you 're lucky , you develop personally - whether it 's forced or not .
in my opinion , a record should reflect that .
i do n't believe for a minute that a band is seriously interested in artistic progress if it sounds the same after 20 years .
i think it 's important because the people in a band reflect how an album sounds .
it 'd be very sad for the musicians if nothing changed even after 30 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in love " represents a different sound for the band , heavier on studio effects you 've said you 've used a lot more electronics and studio effects on your new album .
wo n't it be difficult to perform the songs live ?
pfetzing : the rehearsals went surprisingly well .
we recorded the album before ever having actually played the songs together .
that was also a conscious decision .
interestingly , we 're less scared now than ever before .
we knew that we did n't know how we 'd perform live but we said we 'll worry about that when the record is finished .
juli is known for german-language songs , and there are no english songs on the album , so why did you choose an english title , " in love " ?
briegel : one reason is that we do n't have a pigeon-hole mentality : german band vs. english band .
we also thought that the english term - or " denglish " term - " in love " is more fitting than the german term " verliebt , " which we found too narrow . eva , you 're on tour for the first time as a mom .
how do you juggle childcare and concerts ?
briegel : with meticulous planning .
my partner 's joining us on tour .
my family is around .
we 'll sleep on the tour bus with the guys , but there 'll be a door between us with the rest of the band up front and us in the back .
it 's a double-decker and all partying will be down in the lower level .

there are now 2.93 million people out of work in germany , the lowest figure since 1991 .
the unemployment rate remained steady at seven percent .
in the former east , it stands at 10.7 percent , in western germany it is at six percent .

it would seem that certain top officials in beijing are not so enthusiastic about their north korean " brother " . according to certain documents revealed by the controversial website wikileaks , the chinese government has a more critical attitude towards its north korean ally than usually comes across officially . north korea 's sole ally has apparently been exasperated by pyongyang 's provocations and that the bilateral relationship might be losing strategic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparently china is becoming less keen on its north korean ally in april 2009 , chinese deputy foreign minister he yafei is reported to have said pyongyang was behaving like a " spoiled child in order to get the attention of the ' adult " ' by carrying out missile tests . china urges us to deal with fallout ' properly ' the chinese foreign ministry has reacted with anger to the leaks of secret messages sent by us diplomats at embassies .

despite cultural differences , it is expected to generate great public interest in china . one of the world 's most significant enlightenment art exhibitions is due to open at the national museum of china in the spring of 2011 , titled " the art of the enlightenment . "
it comprises nearly 600 exhibits - including paintings , sculptures and even scientific inventions - that originate from the 18th-century western cultural movement which advocated reason as the primary source for legitimacy and authority . it is to be the first exhibition held at the beijing museum 's newly-renovated and expanded facilities - planned by hamburg architectural company gerkan , marg and partners .
the extension to the museum makes it the largest in the world . " the chinese public will appreciate the highly developed painting techniques and the artistic level of german and european artists , " commented huang zhenchun , the national museum 's deputy director . the exhibits are sourced from the berlin state museums collections , the dresden state art collections and the bavarian state picture collections . shaping of a culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich 's works often reflect enlightenment philosophy western art and culture , especially philosophy and science , have been well-received in china .
many works have been translated into chinese , and to this day political and social debates in china are strongly influenced by western thought .
director of the berlin state museums , michael eissenhauer , expects the new exhibition to be met with interest . " we always discover a deep knowledge of literature from this period in our -lsb- chinese -rsb- contacts , " said eissenhauer .
" but this is less true of visual art . " the exhibition aims to present the works in the context of ideological tradition .
for instance , when british painter henry fuseli depicts the battle between sin , satan , and death , it can be seen as a deviation from traditional christian dogma : the interest in evil represents a new-found freedom . likewise , the romantic-style paintings of german painter caspar david friedrich can be interpreted in the context of jean-jacques rousseau 's state-of-nature philosophy , according to klaus schrenk , director of the bavarian state picture collections . " rousseau makes one of the greatest demands on the development of humankind and questions the absolute power of french kings , " said schrenk .
similarly , friedrich 's works also represent mankind 's natural right to self-determination , he added . a discussion program between german and chinese scholars will help the public understand these parallels better .
the german federal foreign office , a co-sponsor , sees a political side of the exhibition . " -lsb- german philosopher -rsb- kant translated the ' sapere aude ' maxim of -lsb- roman -rsb- poet horace as ' have courage to use your own understanding , " ' said werner wnendt , head of the directorate-general for culture and communication at the federal foreign office .
" this motto of the enlightenment calls for politics to take this seriously and to allow the use of reasoning . " politics ' not the task of museums ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlightenment art questions old beliefs traditions the exhibition comes at a time when the values associated with the european enlightenment are a subject of heated debate .
the awarding of the nobel peace prize to chinese dissident writer liu xiaobo has once again attracted international attention to the topic of freedom of speech in china . one of the core concepts that emerged from the enlightenment - the idea that certain values are universal - has been intensely discussed in chinese intellectual circles in recent months .
however , according to eissenhauer , the art exhibition will not feature any references to current political ideology , which he believes is a matter for the foreign ministry , but " not the task of art museums . " the exhibition was meant to have opened this year , but was postponed due to delays in the museum building project .
the works are scheduled to remain in beijing for 15 months , with no other locations in china involved . author : mathias boelinger -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu 's justice commissioner renews calls for an increased and more unified data protection laws . on tuesday , the european commission began an investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
earlier in the year , a number of european companies - including french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the british site foundem - filed complaints with the eu executive body , arguing that they were not allowed to advertise on google .
" the commission will investigate whether google has abused a dominant market position in online search by allegedly lowering the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services which are specialized in providing users with specific online content such as price comparisons -lrb- so-called vertical search services -rrb- and by according preferential placement to the results of its own vertical search services in order to shut out competing services , " wrote the commission in a statement posted on its website .
stiff fines possible if the finding ultimately is against google , the company could face fines of up to 10 percent of its revenue , which would be around $ 2.4 billion or 1.84 billion euros .
however , if precedent is any guide , google 's case and legal battles with the eu may drag on for years , similar to brussels ' antitrust lawsuit against microsoft , which only ended last year .
in a statement provided to the associated press , the silicon valley company maintained that it had not done anything wrong .
" since we started google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry - ensuring that ads are always clearly marked , making it easy for users and advertisers to take their data with them when they switch services , and investing heavily in open source projects , " google said in an emailed statement .
" but there 's always going to be room for improvement , and so we 'll be working with the commission to address any concerns , " the company said .
new data protection proposals in a related matter , eu justice commissioner viviane reding told the european data protection and privacy conference in brussels on tuesday that the bloc 's data protection system needed to be completely re-worked to give more power to an eu organization rather than allowing different countries to apply their own standards .

" this did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different member states .
this situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing data protection directive : ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the single market . "
reding also re-iterated some policy goals that she had previously outlined this month , including the right of consumers " to be forgotten " online , and the " need to be well and clearly informed , in a transparent way , about how and by whom their data are collected . "

the karlsruhe-based court ruled against a german woman 's claim that the investigation into her case was " illegal " because it was based on a stolen cd purchased by germany 's bka intelligence agency in 2008 .
authorities in bochum used information on the disc - containing account information from a bank in the small alpine tax haven of liechtenstein - as grounds to search the woman 's apartment , to which she objected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizens may have more than 23 billion euros in swiss bank accounts the court rejected the claim , ruling instead that such police searches are legal and all evidence obtained through them admissible .
a dangerous precedent ?
despite the financial benefits for the state , tax lawyer jens schmidt of the international law firm white and case is not happy with the decision , mainly because it effectively puts state prosecutors above the law .
" i do n't really see this as a positive development , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's always this consideration in the background - the principle is , state prosecutors are n't allowed to do anything illegal .
but then they do n't draw the conclusion - as you would do for instance under us law - that this makes the whole investigation impermissible . "
but for thomas eigenthaler of the german tax workers union , tax investigators have a duty to get information about tax cheats any way they can .
" tax investigators and tax workers need clarity , " he commented . " as far as we 're concerned - if you can buy the data , you have to buy the data , and the political parties that deny this will gain a reputation for protecting tax evaders . "

but now authorities in all states will be able to prosecute tax evaders , irrespective of how evidence is gathered .
in february , authorities in the state of north-rhine westphalia bought a stolen tax cd for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- containing information on over 1,000 accounts at a swiss bank .
at least six more such cds have since been bought by german authorities , at a cost of several million euros each .
for the state it 's probably very good business : it is estimated the tax man could stand to receive up to a billion euros in back taxes thanks to the cds .
in response , around 20,000 germans turned themselves into the authorities , resulting in surpluses of over one billion euros in government coffers .

fifa had already suspended two executive committee members over similar allegations . a bbc television report and an article in the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper prompted watchdog body transparency international to call for a thorough independent investigation and for thursday 's vote in zurich to be postponed .
" fifa 's integrity and credibility , already shaken in the past , have been badly tarnished and the reputational damage suffered by fifa these last weeks is considerable , " the anti-corruption organization said in a statement .
" the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football world cup must be postponed until all light has been shed on the allegations published in the press .
these have cast such discredit on fifa 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . "
' unpatriotic ' timing the bbc television program " panorama , " which aired on monday night , accused three fifa executives of taking bribes worth millions of dollars .
the three men - ricardo teixera of brazil , african football chief issa hayatou and south america 's nicolas leoz - are alleged to have received secret payments from the international sports and leisure -lrb- isl -rrb- sports marketing firm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations fifa president sepp blatter declined to comment on the corruption allegations facing the executives , though in the " panorama " report he had said that all isl officials implicated in the bribery scandal had been exonerated .
meanwhile , officials campaigning for england 's 2018 bid have since lashed out at the bbc for running the report , which they deemed " sensationalist " and ill-timed .
" if -lsb- the bbc -rsb- truly believes there 's a journalistic reason to run this panorama - and that that 's their decision - then they could have done it at any time in the past two years , " england bid chief andy anson said .
" to do it the week before the vote is about one thing - sensationalism .
i do n't think that 's helpful and i do n't think it 's patriotic . "
england is up against favorites russia and the two joint bids from spain / portugal and holland / belgium to host the 2018 world cup .
the 2022 race , also scheduled to be decided in thursday 's vote , sees australia , qatar , japan , south korea and the united states vying for the competition .

despite strong recent showings against two opponents , team captain birgit prinz is not complacent . in the draw for next year 's fifa women 's world cup , hosts and champions germany were pitted against canada , nigeria and france in the group stages .
winners of the competition in 2003 and 2007 , germany will face their first soccer showdown of the tournament in berlin on june 26 against canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz said sides would raise their game in the tournament the team will meet nigeria in frankfurt on june 30 before going on to face france in moenchengladbach on july 5 .
despite outstanding recent victories against two of the group opponents , the germans are not expecting an easy ride as a result of the draw , held in frankfurt am main on monday .
" it will certainly be difficult , " said team captain and three-times women 's world player of the year , birgit prinz , who recently announced plans to retire after the world cup .
team trainer silvia neid remained philosophical about the opposition .
" i just have to take whatever we get , " said neid .
" in that regard , i 'm satisfied .
we are happy that we know who we are going to play against . "
convincing victories no guarantee of success the germans last faced the north americans as recently as september 15 in a warm-up fixture , winning that match 5-0 .
it is a result that prinz thinks is unlikely to be repeated in the tournament 's opening game .
bildunterschrift : teams from 16 nations will take part in a tournament hosted by nine german cities next summer " that is not the norm , " said prinz .
" it was a warm-up game that went relatively well for us .
i do n't think that the opening game will be settled so decisively . "
last thursday , germany 's women also demolished a hopelessly overwhelmed nigeria side 8-0 in leverkusen .
however , nigeria 's " super falcons " are a dominant force in african women 's football .
france could prove a tougher test , since they are the fourth-rated women 's side in europe after germany , sweden and norway .
thirty-two matches will be staged between the opening game and the july 17 final , with augsburg , berlin , bochum , dresden , frankfurt , leverkusen , moenchengladbach , sinsheim and wolfsburg as host cities .

the news is a blow to opponents of the plan , who claim it would be bad news for employees . spanish construction group actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- took a decisive step forward in its hostile takeover bid for germany 's largest builder hochtief on monday , gaining approval from financial regulators .
germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin gave the green light to the proposal after improvements were made to an earlier offer to shareholders .
" with the revised offer document submitted today , acs provided all the required improvements .
therefore bafin has approved the proposal , " a statement from bafin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are not at all happy about the planned hostile takeover an official period for hochtief shareholders to accept will begin with the publication of the official acs offer , expected in december .
the approval is a blow for the hochtief board , which has been fighting the takeover for months .
opponents of the takeover fear that it could lead to a restructuring of the company , with german employees bearing the brunt of job losses .
hochtief 's chief labor representative , siegfried mueller , sharply criticized the german government shortly before the announcement .
he said that workers had been " left in the lurch " by a lack of direct state intervention .
in october , the head of germany 's social democrat opposition party , sigmar gabriel , called on chancellor angela merkel to find a rival corporate " white knight " to prevent the takeover .
share-swap deal did not satisfy acs announced plans in september to launch a 2.7-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- shares bid for the 70 percent of hochtief that it did not own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief head herbert luetkestratkoetter has vowed to fight the bid the madrid-based concern has been seeking a deal based on the swapping of stakes in both companies .
hochtief bosses said the original offer did not reflect the german firm 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros .
acs became hochtief 's biggest shareholder in 2007 by acquiring a 25-percent stake .
it has since increased holdings to just below an important 30 percent threshold , which it may now exceed .
this would allow acs to acquire shares on the open market and gradually achieve its target of 50 percent ownership of hochtief .
the head of hochtief , herbert luetkestratkoetter , has been seeking to prevent the takeover .
he said he would " definitely " take strategic action .
hochtief 's management had considered making the inclusion of its australian subsidiary , leighton , a mandatory part of the deal in a bid to increase the price and make it harder for acs to acquire the company .

the airline plans to use the dual fuel sources on its four-times-daily service between hamburg and frankfurt from april 2011 , in a project aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" through the test on the route between hamburg and frankfurt , the effect of the biofuel on the maintenance and lifespan of the engines can be investigated , " said manfred aigner , head of the german aerospace center 's combustion technology institute .

project leader joachim buse told a press conference that the use of biofuel would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 metric tons over the six-month test period .
while air japan and air new zealand have already tested biofuels in their airplanes , lufthansa said it would be the first carrier to use them on a regular basis .
the airline said it hoped that biofuels could make up between five and ten percent of its fuel consumption by 2020 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2010 hanover 's high-fliers leave fans , pundits wondering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka thinks hanover should work on their self-esteem hanover 96 are currently enjoying barely conceivable success in the bundesliga - riding high in fourth place and on a run of three straight victories .
and no one really knows why . " how did this happen ? "
that 's the question currently echoing around the streets of hanover .
after an emphatic 3-0 win over freiburg on saturday , the bundesliga side is flying so high - an unnatural fourth place - it 's a wonder the players do n't complain of nosebleeds and dizziness .
last season , their best league position at any point was eighth .
and that was after match day three .
now the season is nearly at the half-way mark , and they 've just won three on the spin and confidence is soaring after victory in a 3-2 thriller against northern german rivals hamburg 10 days ago .
in fact , if you 're the sort of football fan - and most are - who sees any remotely regional proximity as bitter derby rivalry , then hanover are the champions of the north .
hamburg , st. pauli , bremen and wolfsburg are all languishing beneath them in the table - an unprecedented state of affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victory over northern rivals hamburg was particularly satisfying it 's a huge contrast to this time last year , when the club was in trauma following the suicide of their national goalkeeper , robert enke .
the team , deeply affected by the tragedy , subsequently stepped close to the abyss of relegation , leaving it to the last game of the season to save their place in the league .
positive thinking so it 's probably only natural that those in charge at hanover are more relieved at the 14-point cushion between themselves and the relegation zone than energized at the one-point margin that separates them from a champions league qualification place .
certainly , the club does not appear to be planning an assault on leverkusen in that third place .
club president martin kind is just grateful that he can have a peaceful holiday : " after our strenuous season a year ago , i think we 've earned a quiet christmas , " he said after saturday 's match .
" forty points is our target , " he added , as if to underline his modesty .
with 25 points in the bank and the winter break still three matches away , that is a pretty cautious aim .
perhaps coach mirko slomka had kind 's words in mind when he told news weekly die zeit , " we have to work on our self-esteem .
together with the director and the president , i 'm working on developing a self-image that we 're a really good bundesliga club . "
therapy has been an important tool in slomka 's kit-bag .
arriving three months after enke 's death , he worked long and hard to dig his players out of a psychological black-hole last season .
" i did n't think it would be so hard to stay up , " he told die zeit , recalling the despairing six-match losing streak that followed his arrival .
before this season began , his job was widely regarded as the most precarious , following an early cup exit to fourth division elversberg .
but since then , it 's all been going right , and media reports say slomka is about to sign a new contract .
bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is in form and friends again with slomka begging the question ...
so what have hanover been doing right ?
slomka 's answer is a little unsatisfactory : " this team has strength of character , is motivated , self-confident , and has tactical discipline , " he said at the post-match press conference on saturday , reading from the football coach 's handbook of how to fob off the press .
but the press , for their part , seem equally at a loss .
" i ca n't explain it myself , " uwe von holt , sports editor at hanover 's neue presse newspaper , told deutsche welle .
" it 's partly just that they 've functioned as a team at times when they 've played against teams who have n't , for example , schalke at the start of the season . "
so it 's just luck ?
" not just luck , " said von holt .
" if you look at them , the team really is n't that bad , when they 're not injured .
going forward we 've been outstanding , especially through didier ya konan . "
return of the old guard the ivorian has certainly been hanover 's most eye-catching striker this season , with six bundesliga goals .
but he was at the club last season as well .
in fact , the most notable aspect of the hanover 's recent success is that it is not the new signings that are shining , but the re-emergence of old talents - particularly mike hanke and jan schlaudraff , two unsettled strikers who have been angling for a transfer .
both scored in recent matches .
-lrb- hanke still wants out , unhappy that he 's only ever used as a late substitute .
schlaudraff , meanwhile , seems to have repaired his fractured relationship with slomka . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of robert enke affected the club on the pitch as well as off but the key thing , said von holt , is that this season 's new signings are all actually playing .
" all the players who have been promoted from the reserves or from the second bundesliga are finding a place in the team , " he said .
the economy of these new transfers is also notable .
of the 11 new arrivals , only one cost any money : mohammed abdellaoue , who came from norwegian club valerenga for the princely sum of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
he has already scored four goals in 10 appearances .
he is currently taking a break , having played a full norwegian season and is expected back in the new year .
" he 'll play a big part in the second half of the season , " says von holt .
norbert fettback of the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- haz -rrb- thinks the new signings have had a bigger effect than a first glance might reveal .
he said austrian defender emanuel pogatetz , who arrived on a free transfer from english team middlesbrough , has provided the team with much-needed leadership at the back .
" i have to say the sporting director joerg schmadtke has shown a really good nose for signings , " said fettback .
" in the past we 've spent a lot of money on players and have n't got anything out of them . "
but fettback refused to get carried away .
" there 's a danger that the fans are getting a bit over-excited , " said fettback .
" but i 've been reporting on hanover 96 for the past 25 years , and i 've learned to be cautious . "
simple but effective von holt also noted that a lot of hanover 's success came down to a pragmatic approach to tactics .
" they 've decided that ball possession is not so important , " he said .
" they keep their shape and then go on the counter-attack .
that obviously does n't work against every team , but it 's been going well so far . "
but there 's a reason why von holt and his colleagues were being so cautious .
" a lot of teams do the same thing , and obviously there 's a problem when two teams meet with this idea , " he noted .
" hanover have problems when the other team is also trying not to dictate play .
about 80 percent of the bundesliga does it . "
for all slomka 's optimism and positive energy , maybe pessimism is just in the hanoverian dna .
" the mood is really good for now , but everyone knows it wo n't be enough to get any further , " said von holt .
" no one is expecting that either . "
asked to make a prediction for the rest of the season , both von holt and his colleague fettback at the haz said eighth would be a good finish .
" a hanoveran is not someone who has a carnival every day , " said von holt .
" like other northern germans , we 're not exactly the euphoric type . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy middle east -pipe- 30.11.2010 wikileaks revelations on iran create problems for gulf states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad now knows who his true allies are tensions in the middle east are increasing as the fallout from the latest wikileaks revelations spreads .
previously reticent arab states have been exposed as having discussed strikes on iran with the us . hundreds of thousands of classified us embassy dispatches and documents , made public by the whistle-blower website wikileaks on sunday , included transcripts of conversations between middle eastern leaders and us diplomats and military officials .
among the most inflammatory were those between saudi arabia 's king abdullah , us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and general david petraeus in which the saudi monarch urged the us to stop iran 's nuclear program by any means necessary .
according to the april 20 , 2008 transcript from riyadh , king abdullah called on the united states " to cut off the head of the snake " during the meeting . this opinion was echoed in a separate document , dated november 4 , 2009 , in which bahrain 's king hamad bin isa al-khalifa is alleged to have told general petraeus that iran was " the source of much of the trouble in both iran and afghanistan " and that " the danger of letting -lsb- iran 's nuclear program -rsb- go on is greater than the danger of stopping it . "
abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammad bin zayed is also named in a transcript , dated april 10 , 2006 , in which he allegedly told the americans that he was " unwilling to wait much longer " in regard to taking action against iran .
unsurprisingly , conversations between us and israel also tackle the iran situation , with the israeli officials telling the americans in 2009 that washington was running out of time to stop tehran and that 2010 was the " critical year . "
revelations expose extent of gulf states ' concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah urged the us to take action to stop iran the documents show the level of concern within the middle east of iran 's nuclear ambitions and , contrary to the public declarations of a number of arab states , the apparent willingness to deal with the threat militarily .
while israel 's favoring of air strikes is well-known and documented , no arab nations have gone on record as saying they would support us action or take their own to stop tehran .
a particular danger to stability now lies in the perception that arab states named in the documents are on the same page as the us and israel in regard to policy toward iran .
" the latest wikileaks revelations threaten to upset the balance in the gulf states between the hostility of public opinion to us security involvement in regional affairs with their private acknowledgment of the us as their ultimate security guarantor , " kristian ulrichsen , a middle east expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they demonstrate the deep suspicions held by the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states . "
little to surprise already skeptical iranians while the wikileaks revelations will have made the distrust and behind-the-scenes machinations public , professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , believes the information revealed wo n't come as too great a shock to the iranians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public hatred of the us may spread to the gulf regimes " iranian officials know that the saudis do n't trust them , " perthes told deutsche welle .
" much of what we can see of the small amount of cables so far published would not really add much beyond reinforcing suspicions that the saudis are actually in cahoots with washington , even though they pretend , in official meetings , that they value good neighborly relations . " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , concurred .
" there is nothing in these revelations that surprises the iranian authorities , " he said . " they know how the saudis as well as all the other arabs feel about them .
but the fact that these disclosures have become public is an embarrassment for the saudis in their future dealings with iran and a reminder to them of what the iranians have been saying that you can never trust the americans . "
saudi arabia at risk of destabilization however , while iran may not be shocked into action by the revelations , factions within saudi arabia may be .
there is an escalating unease in the kingdom itself over its allegiance to the united states , and its willingness to support the us and even join in with any military action it mounts against iran .
outwardly , the saudis have been telling the united states that under no circumstances should it bomb iran , or allow israel to do so .
riyadh has publicly told the us that saudi arabia and its neighbors would not support such actions , that us support in the region would evaporate if it attacked iran and that saudi arabia and its oil-rich allies would not make up any shortfall of crude production which would follow a us strike on iran , opec 's second-highest oil producer behind the saudis .
the wikileaks ' documents appear to contradict these public statements , a situation that may anger factions within saudi arabia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's true feelings for iran have been exposed " it is likely that much of the sunni establishment in saudi arabia will agree with king abdullah 's characterization of the iranian nuclear program as a threat that needs to be halted and removed , " ulrichsen said .
" it is the reaction of saudi arabia 's shiite communities in the eastern province that will be interesting , as they have suffered from relative socio-economic marginalization . "
" iran could use the revelations to signify that the gloves are now off , and ratchet up its overt and covert activities , including the presumed existence of sleeper cells in saudi arabia and throughout the gcc which could be activated to sow political and regional instability . "
militants eager to exploit divisions in saudi arabia any threat to the monarchy - either through agitation from within or problems arising from a succession as king abdullah 's health fails - will be a concern to the west .
in august , al qaeda called on its soldiers in osama bin laden 's homeland to overthrow the saudi royal family .
a saudi kingdom in chaos would be hugely destabilizing to the wider region , not to mention the world 's oil industry .
" there is a danger that saudis of yemeni origin in the three southern border provinces of asir , najran and jizan may react to the documents ' revelations of american support for saudi arabia 's military strikes against the houthi shia separatist group in 2009-10 by extending active or passive support to the cross-border saudi-yemeni branch of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , " said ulrichsen .
