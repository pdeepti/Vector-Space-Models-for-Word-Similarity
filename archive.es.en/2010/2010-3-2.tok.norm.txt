but will it be enough ?
general motors has announced it will triple its promised investment in opel as part of a broadbased restructuring of its european operations .
but no jobs are likely to be saved in spite of the increased financial input . us car manufacturing giant , general motors , has said it will pump three times as much money into its european units , opel and vauxhall , as it had previously planned . the move , which may be welcomed by a workforce demoralised by threats of vast job losses , will improve the company 's standing in europe . the new plans mean that gm will invest 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in opel .
it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .
a factory in antwerp , belgium , is due to be closed during 2010 , although local resistance is ongoing . new money wo n't save jobs gm 's indecision last year over the future of opel incurred the wrath of european governments and workers alike when at the last minute it abandoned a long-awaited deal with canada 's magna .
german chancellor angela merkel had put her weight behind the complex arrangement in an effort to secure german jobs . opel ceo nick reilly said in a statement on tuesday that he hoped the news of the vast increase in investment would be " well received " by europe . whatever the size of the financial infusion , gm still plans over 8,000 job cuts in opel factories across europe .
opel has about 50,000 workers , half of whom are based in its four german factories . td / dpa / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .

according to the court , the provisions of the law in its current form were too vague .
however , the decision did not go so far as to rule out the storage of data outright .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 02.03.2010 german court rules data storage law ' unconstitutional ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law monitoring telephone and internet usage went into effect in 2008 germany 's constitutional court ruled that a highly controversial privacy law should be overturned .
even before the verdict , the case made history : a record number of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the existing law . germany 's federal constitutional court ruled tuesday that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
according to the court , the provisions of the law in its current form were too vague .
however , the decision did not go so far as to rule out the storage of data outright .
the highly controversial law , in place since 2008 , required telecom companies to store data from telephone , mobile and e-mail communication , as well as internet surfing sessoins , for up to half a year .
that backlog of data must now be deleted , and no further data stored .
around 35,000 people opposed the law in germany 's largest class action suit , among them lawyers , doctors , journalists and politicians from the green party the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party , called the ruling a “ slap in the face of legislators ” who had been trying to walk all over the constitution .
before the ruling , burkhard hirsch , a member of the fdp , said the state had been “ treating citizens as potential offenders . "
law ' crucial ' in fighting terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the current law was ' too vague ' “ i though the law was correct , ” said peter altmaier , a christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- caucus leader , following the ruling in berlin .
“ i will respect the decision .
but i am not happy , that -lsb- the court -rsb- struck down the law . ”
he said without the data , the gathering of intelligence will now be much more difficult , though he didn ’ t expect german security to suffer . wolfgang bosbach , the cdu chairman of the federal internal affairs committee , warned earlier of the adverse consequences of the court ’ s decision for the fight against terrorism .
" supporters of terrorism are stealthy and highly communicative , and we need access to this data , " he told the daily bild newspaper on tuesday .
bosbach said such data is crucial to preventing terror attacks like those in madrid and london in 2004 and 2005 .
" there are no fingerprints , no traces of dna -lsb- online -rsb- .
if we do n't have this data , then many of these offenses will go undetected . " cmk / afp / dpa / epd editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control the german court 's ruling overturning a law that lets anti-terror authorities save data on telephone calls and e-mails is only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.03.2010 gm recalls 1.3 million cars to fix power steering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is recalling chevys with faulty power steering motors general motors will recall 1.3 million cars in the us , canada and mexico to fix a power steering problem , the carmaker said monday .
europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .

the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

the german ambassador is delighted that americans apparently associate germany with technology , art and culture . germany 's us ambassador klaus scharioth said he was " more than happy " with the results of a new survey presented on monday evening in washington dc .
the survey showed " the americans ' thoroughly positive view of our country , " scharioth said .
the survey , commissioned by the german embassy , found that 48 percent of us citizens asked had an ' excellent ' or ' good ' general impression of germany , while 41 percent believed that germany and the us enjoyed ' excellent ' or ' good ' relations with one another .
these are the most positive results since the regular survey was first carried out in 2002 .
the last time this popularity survey was undertaken in october 2008 , only 43 percent of americans had a positive view of germany , and only 34 percent thought the usa had good relations with germany .
most us citizens connect germany with technology , art and culture , the results concluded .
48 percent thought of germany as a high-tech country , while 44 percent believed that germany boasted a lively art and culture scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador klaus scharioth was delighted with the survey student love scharioth drew particular encouragement from the fact that us students had an especially positive view of germany .
as many as 46 percent of college students saw germany as a leading country on a host of environmental issues , from renewable energy , to energy efficiency , to environmental protection laws .
this was significantly above the average opinion among the us population , only 29 percent of whom thought of germany as an environmental leader .
but while germany 's popularity in the us may be gradually increasing , its standing in the world is apparently on the decline .
only 43 percent of americans believe that germany still plays an important role in international politics , down from 49 percent in 2004 .
only around 25 percent of americans believe that germany contributes significantly to the global fight against terrorism , and 47 percent think that germany should be doing more .
not important , but good brewers germany is also losing ground as one of the usa 's most important international partners .
the survey found that americans think of canada , britain , japan and china as more important allies , whose actions affect us policy more significantly .
but there is one area in which germany still stands out in the american psyche .
when asked what aspect of the country they would like to learn more about , the most common answer was not culture , art or sports , but beer. bk / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .

sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .

in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .

sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

but will it be enough ?
general motors has announced it will triple its promised investment in opel as part of a broadbased restructuring of its european operations .
but no jobs are likely to be saved in spite of the increased financial input . us car manufacturing giant , general motors , has said it will pump three times as much money into its european units , opel and vauxhall , as it had previously planned . the move , which may be welcomed by a workforce demoralised by threats of vast job losses , will improve the company 's standing in europe . the new plans mean that gm will invest 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in opel .
it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .
a factory in antwerp , belgium , is due to be closed during 2010 , although local resistance is ongoing . new money wo n't save jobs gm 's indecision last year over the future of opel incurred the wrath of european governments and workers alike when at the last minute it abandoned a long-awaited deal with canada 's magna .
german chancellor angela merkel had put her weight behind the complex arrangement in an effort to secure german jobs . opel ceo nick reilly said in a statement on tuesday that he hoped the news of the vast increase in investment would be " well received " by europe . whatever the size of the financial infusion , gm still plans over 8,000 job cuts in opel factories across europe .
opel has about 50,000 workers , half of whom are based in its four german factories . td / dpa / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros .

it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .

it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .

peta says the two can only be allowed to stay together if he is castrated . peta , the radical animal rights organization , known for its headline-grabbing stunts to put people off wearing furs , says that knut , germany 's most famous animal , should face one of the cruellest cuts of all .
as a cub , knut won the hearts of millions around the world after being rejected by his mother , to be successfully hand-reared in berlin zoo by his keeper , thomas doerflein , who slept on a mattress next to his crate each night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut even met leonardo dicaprio on the cover of vanity fair the knut cult knut 's fame was such that when he was presented to the public for the first time , on march 23 , 2007 , around 500 journalists from all over the world attended .
but fame is fickle and now the german branch of people for ethical treatment of animals , says that knut should be castrated because he is currently sharing an enclosure with gianna , who came to berlin from munich last year to keep knut company .
frank albrecht , the group 's zoo expert , has noted that gianna and knut have the same grandfather and are thus first cousins .
expert says castration necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut was reared by his foster father , berlin zookeeper thomas doerflein he says that any offspring would risk suffering from a condition known as " incest depression " .

it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .

some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .

jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .

the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .
bosnia 's 1992-1995 war between croats , muslims and serbs ended in the deaths of about 100,000 people .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .
bosnia 's 1992-1995 war between croats , muslims and serbs ended in the deaths of about 100,000 people .

but will it be enough ?
general motors has announced it will triple its promised investment in opel as part of a broadbased restructuring of its european operations .
but no jobs are likely to be saved in spite of the increased financial input . us car manufacturing giant , general motors , has said it will pump three times as much money into its european units , opel and vauxhall , as it had previously planned . the move , which may be welcomed by a workforce demoralised by threats of vast job losses , will improve the company 's standing in europe . the new plans mean that gm will invest 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in opel .
it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .
a factory in antwerp , belgium , is due to be closed during 2010 , although local resistance is ongoing . new money wo n't save jobs gm 's indecision last year over the future of opel incurred the wrath of european governments and workers alike when at the last minute it abandoned a long-awaited deal with canada 's magna .
german chancellor angela merkel had put her weight behind the complex arrangement in an effort to secure german jobs . opel ceo nick reilly said in a statement on tuesday that he hoped the news of the vast increase in investment would be " well received " by europe . whatever the size of the financial infusion , gm still plans over 8,000 job cuts in opel factories across europe .
opel has about 50,000 workers , half of whom are based in its four german factories . td / dpa / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .

whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .
in september , the directive on mass data storage is up for critical examination by the european parliament .

it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros . " the selection of historical buildings - which are restored and kept up - show how germans want to remember , " said klein .
" that 's why collective memory , like national identity , is such a highly complicated phenomenon . " author : candice novak editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below .

posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .

so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .

berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .

berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .
bosnia 's 1992-1995 war between croats , muslims and serbs ended in the deaths of about 100,000 people .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

but fame is fickle and now the german branch of people for ethical treatment of animals , says that knut should be castrated because he is currently sharing an enclosure with gianna , who came to berlin from munich last year to keep knut company .

albrecht has commented on knut before .
at the time of knut 's public debut , germany 's popular bild newspaper quoted him saying that knut should have been killed rather than been raised as a " domestic pet . "
this led to a national campaign with groups of children picketing the berlin zoo carrying placards reading " knut must live . "
albrecht , however , later insisted that he had been quoted out of context and that he had never really called for knut 's death. td / afp / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.03.2010 opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highest german court has overturned a law allowing anti-terror authorities to save data on phone calls and e-mails .
it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .
in september , the directive on mass data storage is up for critical examination by the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.03.2010 opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highest german court has overturned a law allowing anti-terror authorities to save data on phone calls and e-mails .
it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .
in september , the directive on mass data storage is up for critical examination by the european parliament .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .

in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .

it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .

the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .
in september , the directive on mass data storage is up for critical examination by the european parliament .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros . " the selection of historical buildings - which are restored and kept up - show how germans want to remember , " said klein .
" that 's why collective memory , like national identity , is such a highly complicated phenomenon . " author : candice novak editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .

north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

general motors has announced it will triple its promised investment in opel as part of a broadbased restructuring of its european operations .
but no jobs are likely to be saved in spite of the increased financial input . us car manufacturing giant , general motors , has said it will pump three times as much money into its european units , opel and vauxhall , as it had previously planned . the move , which may be welcomed by a workforce demoralised by threats of vast job losses , will improve the company 's standing in europe . the new plans mean that gm will invest 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in opel .
it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .
a factory in antwerp , belgium , is due to be closed during 2010 , although local resistance is ongoing . new money wo n't save jobs gm 's indecision last year over the future of opel incurred the wrath of european governments and workers alike when at the last minute it abandoned a long-awaited deal with canada 's magna .
german chancellor angela merkel had put her weight behind the complex arrangement in an effort to secure german jobs . opel ceo nick reilly said in a statement on tuesday that he hoped the news of the vast increase in investment would be " well received " by europe . whatever the size of the financial infusion , gm still plans over 8,000 job cuts in opel factories across europe .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

general motors has announced it will triple its promised investment in opel as part of a broadbased restructuring of its european operations .
but no jobs are likely to be saved in spite of the increased financial input . us car manufacturing giant , general motors , has said it will pump three times as much money into its european units , opel and vauxhall , as it had previously planned . the move , which may be welcomed by a workforce demoralised by threats of vast job losses , will improve the company 's standing in europe . the new plans mean that gm will invest 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in opel .
it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .

german chancellor angela merkel had put her weight behind the complex arrangement in an effort to secure german jobs . opel ceo nick reilly said in a statement on tuesday that he hoped the news of the vast increase in investment would be " well received " by europe . whatever the size of the financial infusion , gm still plans over 8,000 job cuts in opel factories across europe .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 02.03.2010 berlin 's cityscape illustrates evolving german identity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shows of national pride have been linked - and limited to - sports events germany is arguably one of the most history-haunted countries in europe .
but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros . " the selection of historical buildings - which are restored and kept up - show how germans want to remember , " said klein .
" that 's why collective memory , like national identity , is such a highly complicated phenomenon . " author : candice novak editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below .

posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security .

the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .

posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .

the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.03.2010 opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highest german court has overturned a law allowing anti-terror authorities to save data on phone calls and e-mails .
it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.03.2010 opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highest german court has overturned a law allowing anti-terror authorities to save data on phone calls and e-mails .
it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

peta says the two can only be allowed to stay together if he is castrated . peta , the radical animal rights organization , known for its headline-grabbing stunts to put people off wearing furs , says that knut , germany 's most famous animal , should face one of the cruellest cuts of all .
as a cub , knut won the hearts of millions around the world after being rejected by his mother , to be successfully hand-reared in berlin zoo by his keeper , thomas doerflein , who slept on a mattress next to his crate each night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut even met leonardo dicaprio on the cover of vanity fair the knut cult knut 's fame was such that when he was presented to the public for the first time , on march 23 , 2007 , around 500 journalists from all over the world attended .
but fame is fickle and now the german branch of people for ethical treatment of animals , says that knut should be castrated because he is currently sharing an enclosure with gianna , who came to berlin from munich last year to keep knut company .
frank albrecht , the group 's zoo expert , has noted that gianna and knut have the same grandfather and are thus first cousins .

albrecht has commented on knut before .
at the time of knut 's public debut , germany 's popular bild newspaper quoted him saying that knut should have been killed rather than been raised as a " domestic pet . "
this led to a national campaign with groups of children picketing the berlin zoo carrying placards reading " knut must live . "
albrecht , however , later insisted that he had been quoted out of context and that he had never really called for knut 's death. td / afp / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .
bosnia 's 1992-1995 war between croats , muslims and serbs ended in the deaths of about 100,000 people .

the german ambassador is delighted that americans apparently associate germany with technology , art and culture . germany 's us ambassador klaus scharioth said he was " more than happy " with the results of a new survey presented on monday evening in washington dc .
the survey showed " the americans ' thoroughly positive view of our country , " scharioth said .
the survey , commissioned by the german embassy , found that 48 percent of us citizens asked had an ' excellent ' or ' good ' general impression of germany , while 41 percent believed that germany and the us enjoyed ' excellent ' or ' good ' relations with one another .
these are the most positive results since the regular survey was first carried out in 2002 .
the last time this popularity survey was undertaken in october 2008 , only 43 percent of americans had a positive view of germany , and only 34 percent thought the usa had good relations with germany .
most us citizens connect germany with technology , art and culture , the results concluded .
48 percent thought of germany as a high-tech country , while 44 percent believed that germany boasted a lively art and culture scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador klaus scharioth was delighted with the survey student love scharioth drew particular encouragement from the fact that us students had an especially positive view of germany .
as many as 46 percent of college students saw germany as a leading country on a host of environmental issues , from renewable energy , to energy efficiency , to environmental protection laws .
this was significantly above the average opinion among the us population , only 29 percent of whom thought of germany as an environmental leader .
but while germany 's popularity in the us may be gradually increasing , its standing in the world is apparently on the decline .
only 43 percent of americans believe that germany still plays an important role in international politics , down from 49 percent in 2004 .
only around 25 percent of americans believe that germany contributes significantly to the global fight against terrorism , and 47 percent think that germany should be doing more .
not important , but good brewers germany is also losing ground as one of the usa 's most important international partners .
the survey found that americans think of canada , britain , japan and china as more important allies , whose actions affect us policy more significantly .
but there is one area in which germany still stands out in the american psyche .
when asked what aspect of the country they would like to learn more about , the most common answer was not culture , art or sports , but beer. bk / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

even before the verdict , the case made history : a record number of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the existing law . germany 's federal constitutional court ruled tuesday that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
according to the court , the provisions of the law in its current form were too vague .
however , the decision did not go so far as to rule out the storage of data outright .
the highly controversial law , in place since 2008 , required telecom companies to store data from telephone , mobile and e-mail communication , as well as internet surfing sessoins , for up to half a year .
that backlog of data must now be deleted , and no further data stored .
around 35,000 people opposed the law in germany 's largest class action suit , among them lawyers , doctors , journalists and politicians from the green party the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party , called the ruling a “ slap in the face of legislators ” who had been trying to walk all over the constitution .
before the ruling , burkhard hirsch , a member of the fdp , said the state had been “ treating citizens as potential offenders . "

he said without the data , the gathering of intelligence will now be much more difficult , though he didn ’ t expect german security to suffer . wolfgang bosbach , the cdu chairman of the federal internal affairs committee , warned earlier of the adverse consequences of the court ’ s decision for the fight against terrorism .
" supporters of terrorism are stealthy and highly communicative , and we need access to this data , " he told the daily bild newspaper on tuesday .
bosbach said such data is crucial to preventing terror attacks like those in madrid and london in 2004 and 2005 .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .

berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 02.03.2010 german court rules data storage law ' unconstitutional ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law monitoring telephone and internet usage went into effect in 2008 germany 's constitutional court ruled that a highly controversial privacy law should be overturned .
even before the verdict , the case made history : a record number of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the existing law . germany 's federal constitutional court ruled tuesday that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
according to the court , the provisions of the law in its current form were too vague .
however , the decision did not go so far as to rule out the storage of data outright .
the highly controversial law , in place since 2008 , required telecom companies to store data from telephone , mobile and e-mail communication , as well as internet surfing sessoins , for up to half a year .
that backlog of data must now be deleted , and no further data stored .
around 35,000 people opposed the law in germany 's largest class action suit , among them lawyers , doctors , journalists and politicians from the green party the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party , called the ruling a “ slap in the face of legislators ” who had been trying to walk all over the constitution .
before the ruling , burkhard hirsch , a member of the fdp , said the state had been “ treating citizens as potential offenders . "
law ' crucial ' in fighting terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the current law was ' too vague ' “ i though the law was correct , ” said peter altmaier , a christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- caucus leader , following the ruling in berlin .
“ i will respect the decision .
but i am not happy , that -lsb- the court -rsb- struck down the law . ”
he said without the data , the gathering of intelligence will now be much more difficult , though he didn ’ t expect german security to suffer . wolfgang bosbach , the cdu chairman of the federal internal affairs committee , warned earlier of the adverse consequences of the court ’ s decision for the fight against terrorism .
" supporters of terrorism are stealthy and highly communicative , and we need access to this data , " he told the daily bild newspaper on tuesday .
bosbach said such data is crucial to preventing terror attacks like those in madrid and london in 2004 and 2005 .
" there are no fingerprints , no traces of dna -lsb- online -rsb- .
if we do n't have this data , then many of these offenses will go undetected . " cmk / afp / dpa / epd editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control the german court 's ruling overturning a law that lets anti-terror authorities save data on telephone calls and e-mails is only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

even before the verdict , the case made history : a record number of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the existing law . germany 's federal constitutional court ruled tuesday that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
according to the court , the provisions of the law in its current form were too vague .
however , the decision did not go so far as to rule out the storage of data outright .
the highly controversial law , in place since 2008 , required telecom companies to store data from telephone , mobile and e-mail communication , as well as internet surfing sessoins , for up to half a year .
that backlog of data must now be deleted , and no further data stored .
around 35,000 people opposed the law in germany 's largest class action suit , among them lawyers , doctors , journalists and politicians from the green party the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party , called the ruling a “ slap in the face of legislators ” who had been trying to walk all over the constitution .
before the ruling , burkhard hirsch , a member of the fdp , said the state had been “ treating citizens as potential offenders . "
law ' crucial ' in fighting terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the current law was ' too vague ' “ i though the law was correct , ” said peter altmaier , a christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- caucus leader , following the ruling in berlin .
“ i will respect the decision .
but i am not happy , that -lsb- the court -rsb- struck down the law . ”
he said without the data , the gathering of intelligence will now be much more difficult , though he didn ’ t expect german security to suffer . wolfgang bosbach , the cdu chairman of the federal internal affairs committee , warned earlier of the adverse consequences of the court ’ s decision for the fight against terrorism .
" supporters of terrorism are stealthy and highly communicative , and we need access to this data , " he told the daily bild newspaper on tuesday .
bosbach said such data is crucial to preventing terror attacks like those in madrid and london in 2004 and 2005 .
" there are no fingerprints , no traces of dna -lsb- online -rsb- .
if we do n't have this data , then many of these offenses will go undetected . " cmk / afp / dpa / epd editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control the german court 's ruling overturning a law that lets anti-terror authorities save data on telephone calls and e-mails is only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .

but will it be enough ?
general motors has announced it will triple its promised investment in opel as part of a broadbased restructuring of its european operations .
but no jobs are likely to be saved in spite of the increased financial input . us car manufacturing giant , general motors , has said it will pump three times as much money into its european units , opel and vauxhall , as it had previously planned . the move , which may be welcomed by a workforce demoralised by threats of vast job losses , will improve the company 's standing in europe . the new plans mean that gm will invest 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in opel .
it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .
a factory in antwerp , belgium , is due to be closed during 2010 , although local resistance is ongoing . new money wo n't save jobs gm 's indecision last year over the future of opel incurred the wrath of european governments and workers alike when at the last minute it abandoned a long-awaited deal with canada 's magna .
german chancellor angela merkel had put her weight behind the complex arrangement in an effort to secure german jobs . opel ceo nick reilly said in a statement on tuesday that he hoped the news of the vast increase in investment would be " well received " by europe . whatever the size of the financial infusion , gm still plans over 8,000 job cuts in opel factories across europe .
opel has about 50,000 workers , half of whom are based in its four german factories . td / dpa / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

peta says the two can only be allowed to stay together if he is castrated . peta , the radical animal rights organization , known for its headline-grabbing stunts to put people off wearing furs , says that knut , germany 's most famous animal , should face one of the cruellest cuts of all .
as a cub , knut won the hearts of millions around the world after being rejected by his mother , to be successfully hand-reared in berlin zoo by his keeper , thomas doerflein , who slept on a mattress next to his crate each night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut even met leonardo dicaprio on the cover of vanity fair the knut cult knut 's fame was such that when he was presented to the public for the first time , on march 23 , 2007 , around 500 journalists from all over the world attended .
but fame is fickle and now the german branch of people for ethical treatment of animals , says that knut should be castrated because he is currently sharing an enclosure with gianna , who came to berlin from munich last year to keep knut company .
frank albrecht , the group 's zoo expert , has noted that gianna and knut have the same grandfather and are thus first cousins .
expert says castration necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut was reared by his foster father , berlin zookeeper thomas doerflein he says that any offspring would risk suffering from a condition known as " incest depression " .
albrecht has commented on knut before .
at the time of knut 's public debut , germany 's popular bild newspaper quoted him saying that knut should have been killed rather than been raised as a " domestic pet . "
this led to a national campaign with groups of children picketing the berlin zoo carrying placards reading " knut must live . "
albrecht , however , later insisted that he had been quoted out of context and that he had never really called for knut 's death. td / afp / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european trade representative , karel de gucht , currently on a visit to hanoi , said that he had made the offer to the minister of industry there .
de gucht is also due to meet the prime minister , nguyen tan dung . the european union is vietnam 's second largest trade partner after the united states .
its main exports include footwear , garments and sea food .
asean and eu : potential for trade trade between the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the eu rose by 25 percent between 2004 and 2008 to 175 billion euros annually .
though asean is eu 's largest trade partner after the us and china , initial efforts by the eu to launch negotiations on a free trade agreement with asean as a whole have been unsuccesful .
according to de gucht , negotiations with asean as a bloc were not feasible because of the different levels of development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade representative de gucht of the member countries ' economies .
the european union , he said , would focus on trade agreements with individual countries instead .
de gucht is also travelling to singapore on wednesday to launch further negotiations for free trade agreements .
anti dumping tariffs : china at loggerheads talks on a free trade agreement with vietnam are however fraught with problems .
the eu extended anti-dumping duties on footwear from china and vietnam in december 2009 , saying that the countries were exporting at a much lower price than was customary on local markets .
anti-dumping duties seem to have become a sensitive issue , with the eu insisting on having ' a very solid case ' for levying the tax .
beijing in the meantime has registered a complaint with the world trade organization .
vietnam has not issued any official statement on the issue as yet .
apart from tariff issues , final ratification of the fta will also depend on how the european parliament evaluates the human rights ' situation in vietnam and the recent crackdown on democracy activists .
the parliament has also been critical of restrictions on the internet in the country. mg / afp / reuters editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .
in september , the directive on mass data storage is up for critical examination by the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.03.2010 opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highest german court has overturned a law allowing anti-terror authorities to save data on phone calls and e-mails .
it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .
in september , the directive on mass data storage is up for critical examination by the european parliament .
the german constitutional court 's ruling might be helpful . author : marcel fürstenau -lrb- db -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german court rules data storage law ' unconstitutional ' germany 's constitutional court ruled that a highly controversial privacy law should be overturned .
even before the verdict , the case made history : a record number of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the existing law .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .

so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .

futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a meeting with tillich ? 8000 euros , please .
north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 02.03.2010 controversy over myanmar-china pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french company total came under pressure for the controversial gas pipeline from myanmar to thailand , 1996 .
a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.03.2010 opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highest german court has overturned a law allowing anti-terror authorities to save data on phone calls and e-mails .
it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .

but , lately , a subtle identity makeover has been taking place .
the decisions germany makes with its cultural heritage portray that new identity . even after germany 's big anniversary year in 2009 - celebrating 20 years since the fall of the berlin wall and 60 years since the founding of the german democratic republic - german pride is still not an easy subject .
in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros . " the selection of historical buildings - which are restored and kept up - show how germans want to remember , " said klein .

in the previous generation , shows of patriotism were most likely at soccer matches . last year , the dusseldorf-based identity foundation found that , though germans are more readily hoisting the proverbial flag - and sometimes even the literal one , the guilt of germany 's history " is still very present . "
a study involving 2,000 participants found that while 60 percent thought it reasonable to show patriotism , only 30 percent would sing the national anthem or wave the country 's flag in public . ever since the founding of the german republic in 1949 , the question of how patriotic germans should be has jumped repeatedly into public debate , michael klein , a social scientist who worked on the study , told deutsche welle .
throughout his research , klein noticed that central to the debate about german identity " was the impression that patriotism , responsibility and the feeling of duty to one 's country should be decreed from above , when it has to be grown - if at all - slowly from below . " in the last few years , through a controversial ego-boosting ad campaign , the tearing down of a national historical site , and the rebuilding of another , germany - however helped along " from above " - has come to a turning point in the meaning of " ich . " identity rescue efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " you are germany " campaign did n't quite work out as planned to strengthen anemic patriotism , a social marketing campaign was born in 2005 from 25 media organizations to boost german patriotism .
posters baring faces of germans were paired with variations of the phrase " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- . the gfk group , a market research institution , said some 38 million germans saw the campaign between the end of 2005 and early 2006 .
the ad campaign was a public way to try to sway the very private feelings of millions of germans . just as the german public was meant to be thinking of einstein and beethoven and feeling warm and fuzzy about being german , an archival photo surfaced in which a 1935 rally banner behind a blow-up of adolf hitler 's face reads " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- . " surely the campaign contributed to a new national germany identity , " said klein .
but just how much , no one knows . twenty years before the " du bist deutschland " campaign , independent graphic designer kurt braunisch was working on his own campaign , called " excuse me , i 'm german . "
in essence a provocation , the college project hit on the problems of german identity through fake ads . one of them shows a choir singing with an accompanying text , which reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't grasp the past -lrb- … -rrb- and that i 'm not happy to be able to live in peace and social security . "
under a castle on the rhine river another reads , " i apologize that i -lrb- … -rrb- ca n't swap my people and culture for another -lrb- … -rrb- all guest workers irritate me . " " in the united states , i was amazed to see american flags everywhere - even little ones stuck in pizzas - which is a totally italian food , " braunisch told deutsche welle .
" but i just wanted to provoke germans with my campaign to realize they do have a history and a culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolition of the palace of the republic began in 2006 in times of speedy globalization and the insecurities it brings , klein said he and his research team found that germans are identifying more strongly with their country . but which germany are they identifying with ? historical sites and contemporary identity many count the 2006 destruction of the palace of the republic in former east berlin as part of a selective memory that alters the people 's view of germany 's very history . the same year that germany won third in the fifa world cup it hosted , the demolition of the palace of the republic began .
the iconic palace , once home to the east german parliament , went from being an everyday fixture in berlin to , some say , erased history . while the palace of the republic was torn down , another central east german landmark - the berlin wall - is being , at least partially , rebuilt . mark bergfeld , a left party member and activist from cologne , said the difference is that the berlin wall symbolized the topped failed government , while the palace was an internal tool - a symbol of an oppressive party . " i was against tearing it down but under our current system there always has to be a commodification , " said bergfeld , adding that massive asbestos-laden events halls do n't sell . in late 2008 , italian architect franco stella was chosen to rebuild not the former gdr parliament building , but the prussian -lrb- and later the german kaiser 's -rrb- city palace , which had stood in the same location before it was destroyed during world war ii .
the project is expected to be finished in 2013 and cost over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 678 million -rrb- . " the selection of historical places reflect the contemporary identity of a people , " said klein . in a few years , berliners walking along the spree river will still be confronted with the seat of a fallen government - it will just be the german kaiser 's , instead of the gdr 's . new meaning for old symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco stella 's design recreates many details from the pre-war city palace in december , the berlin wall foundation decided to fill a 19-meter -lrb- 62-foot -rrb- gap in the 212-meter section of the wall that runs down bernauer street with metal reinforcement rods .
before the decision was reached , the city and foundation discussed rebuilding the wall with original materials . the stretch of the wall is now lined by a fence on either side - presumably to prevent anyone from hacking off chucks of the spray-painted concrete and selling them as souvenirs . locals joke about how quickly the mood went from ronald reagan 's call to " tear down that wall ! " to essentially building it back up .
ironically , the wall has gone from a hated symbol of divide to a loved symbol of reunification . most of the orange-rusted steel rods have been installed over the last few months , and the surrounding 1.2 kilometers are planned to be designed as a " remembrance landscape , " for which the city and state of berlin will spend an estimated 27 million euros .

google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .
they 're trying to get consumers in , but instead of calling them consumers , they figure that if they call them prosumers – i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they 're looking to buy – that perhaps it wo n't be as bad as it was in previous years .
futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

the president of the german parliament called for a review of party financing laws after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers . the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , called for a review of the laws regulating political party financing .
the christian democrat politician made his remarks on tuesday after revelations that business leaders paid for meetings with two state premiers .
" in germany we have a precise but very rigid set of rules guiding the financing of political parties , " lammert told national broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" the central idea is that a party should neither be financed exclusively by private nor public means , in order to maintain a balance . "
time is money last week , cdu officials in saxony confirmed to german news magazine der spiegel that the party had sold personal meetings with state premier stanislaw tillich to party supporters .
the conservative party officials offered sponsors of a party event the opportunity for a photo shoot , a mention of their business in the welcoming speech and a brief conversation with tillich for about 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- .
the news followed the revelation that the conservative state premier of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , met with business leaders who paid extra fees for the privilege .
state premier juergen ruettgers , who is up for re-election this year , subsequently cast the blame on his party 's secretary-general , who was forced to resign .
damage control so far the sponsoring scandal has been limited to politicians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the party traditionally most affiliated with business interests .
the party has been eager to distance itself from the practice .
" a premier should not be sold for cash .
period , " parliamentary leader volker kauder told the reutlinger general-anzeiger newspaper .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel warned regional party leaders against cozying up to businesses in return for donations , cautioning leaders to avoid mixing the office of the state premier with party sponsorship , lest it be misconstrued as soliciting .

north rhine-westphalia faces state elections on may 9 .
the poll has significance on the federal level , since a defeat for the cdu could mean that germany 's governing coalition might lose its majority in the second chamber of the german parliament .
advertising disguised as donations the practice of sponsoring political parties differs from making a straightforward campaign contribution , said professor hans j. kleinsteuber of the university of hamburg . while party donations over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- must be included in a party 's accountability report and are not tax-deductable , sponsorship is a corporate business expense and can be written off taxes .
the notion of businesses being able to buy a private audience with a premier " smacks of commercialism , " professor kleinsteuber told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental concept of german political parties that one can not buy access to a politician , " said kleinsteuber in a telephone interview .
more transparency there is some support in parliament for more transparency around sponsoring , said professor kleinsteuber , although it 's unlikely to be banned outright : " currently , the discussion is more about regulating the practice than banning it completely , " he said .
the green party is in favour of changing the party financing laws to make sponsorship subject to the same restrictions as donations . the left party wants to ban all donations from business .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .

adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

general motors has announced it will triple its promised investment in opel as part of a broadbased restructuring of its european operations .
but no jobs are likely to be saved in spite of the increased financial input . us car manufacturing giant , general motors , has said it will pump three times as much money into its european units , opel and vauxhall , as it had previously planned . the move , which may be welcomed by a workforce demoralised by threats of vast job losses , will improve the company 's standing in europe . the new plans mean that gm will invest 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in opel .
it had previously promised to support the unit with 600 million euros . opel 's main production is based in germany , but it also has plants in poland , britain , spain , hungary and austria .
a factory in antwerp , belgium , is due to be closed during 2010 , although local resistance is ongoing . new money wo n't save jobs gm 's indecision last year over the future of opel incurred the wrath of european governments and workers alike when at the last minute it abandoned a long-awaited deal with canada 's magna .
german chancellor angela merkel had put her weight behind the complex arrangement in an effort to secure german jobs . opel ceo nick reilly said in a statement on tuesday that he hoped the news of the vast increase in investment would be " well received " by europe . whatever the size of the financial infusion , gm still plans over 8,000 job cuts in opel factories across europe .

a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .

the german ambassador is delighted that americans apparently associate germany with technology , art and culture . germany 's us ambassador klaus scharioth said he was " more than happy " with the results of a new survey presented on monday evening in washington dc .
the survey showed " the americans ' thoroughly positive view of our country , " scharioth said .
the survey , commissioned by the german embassy , found that 48 percent of us citizens asked had an ' excellent ' or ' good ' general impression of germany , while 41 percent believed that germany and the us enjoyed ' excellent ' or ' good ' relations with one another .
these are the most positive results since the regular survey was first carried out in 2002 .
the last time this popularity survey was undertaken in october 2008 , only 43 percent of americans had a positive view of germany , and only 34 percent thought the usa had good relations with germany .
most us citizens connect germany with technology , art and culture , the results concluded .
48 percent thought of germany as a high-tech country , while 44 percent believed that germany boasted a lively art and culture scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador klaus scharioth was delighted with the survey student love scharioth drew particular encouragement from the fact that us students had an especially positive view of germany .
as many as 46 percent of college students saw germany as a leading country on a host of environmental issues , from renewable energy , to energy efficiency , to environmental protection laws .
this was significantly above the average opinion among the us population , only 29 percent of whom thought of germany as an environmental leader .
but while germany 's popularity in the us may be gradually increasing , its standing in the world is apparently on the decline .
only 43 percent of americans believe that germany still plays an important role in international politics , down from 49 percent in 2004 .
only around 25 percent of americans believe that germany contributes significantly to the global fight against terrorism , and 47 percent think that germany should be doing more .
not important , but good brewers germany is also losing ground as one of the usa 's most important international partners .
the survey found that americans think of canada , britain , japan and china as more important allies , whose actions affect us policy more significantly .
but there is one area in which germany still stands out in the american psyche .
when asked what aspect of the country they would like to learn more about , the most common answer was not culture , art or sports , but beer. bk / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before the verdict , the case made history : a record number of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the existing law . germany 's federal constitutional court ruled tuesday that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
according to the court , the provisions of the law in its current form were too vague .
however , the decision did not go so far as to rule out the storage of data outright .
the highly controversial law , in place since 2008 , required telecom companies to store data from telephone , mobile and e-mail communication , as well as internet surfing sessoins , for up to half a year .
that backlog of data must now be deleted , and no further data stored .
around 35,000 people opposed the law in germany 's largest class action suit , among them lawyers , doctors , journalists and politicians from the green party the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party , called the ruling a “ slap in the face of legislators ” who had been trying to walk all over the constitution .
before the ruling , burkhard hirsch , a member of the fdp , said the state had been “ treating citizens as potential offenders . "

“ i will respect the decision .
but i am not happy , that -lsb- the court -rsb- struck down the law . ”
he said without the data , the gathering of intelligence will now be much more difficult , though he didn ’ t expect german security to suffer . wolfgang bosbach , the cdu chairman of the federal internal affairs committee , warned earlier of the adverse consequences of the court ’ s decision for the fight against terrorism .
" supporters of terrorism are stealthy and highly communicative , and we need access to this data , " he told the daily bild newspaper on tuesday .
bosbach said such data is crucial to preventing terror attacks like those in madrid and london in 2004 and 2005 .
" there are no fingerprints , no traces of dna -lsb- online -rsb- .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .
bosnia 's 1992-1995 war between croats , muslims and serbs ended in the deaths of about 100,000 people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.03.2010 fresh calls for hukou reform in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese migrant workers do not have access to public services such as health care and other social benefits in the cities in a rare joint appeal earlier this week , more than a dozen chinese newspapers called on the authorities to reform of the country ’ s household registration system called ‘ hukou ’ .
though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "

though the system has been eased to some extent over the past three decades , it still limits the access of millions of migrant workers to social benefits and public services . every chinese citizen is required to be registered in his or her home town .
this means , he or she can access social benefits , such as free healthcare , education and welfare only at that location .
the system called ' hukou ' has functioned well for people , who stay at one place . but it has negatively affected millions of chinese migrant workers who leave the countryside to seek work in the cities .
in urban areas migrant workers get a temporary residency permit , which they have to have extended every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a migrant worker carries his bags as he leave the beijing railway station recently , in a report about china , the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd criticized the hukou system for increasing social inequality .
wang feiling , a political expert at the sam nunn school of international affairs in atlanta , usa agrees .
he says the hukou system is pushing china towards a two-class society : " the problem is a great discrimination against significant members of chinese citizens especially the citizens living in the country side and also in remote regions , " he says .
" the system creates many social and economic injustices . "
reform is challenging reforming the hukou system is , however , difficult .
it helps the chinese authorities to keep an eye on the flow of the migrant workforce .
many fear if the hukou system is abolished , millions of people will leave their villages and migrate to the cities , which will then not be able to finance their social benefits .
in comparison to other emerging countries , such as india and brazil , the chinese cities have fewer shanty town areas , or slums .
thomas scharping , an expert on modern chinese studies at the university of cologne , says there are two ways of looking at the problem : " the freedom to choose your residence and workplace is good for the economy .
but on the other side of the coin you will also see social problems . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese officials believe the household permit system is keeping china free of shanty towns within china as well , hukou is considered unfair .
in an article in qiushi magazine last month , zhou yongkang , the general secretary of the communist party 's political and legislative affairs committee , called for reform of the hukou system to be speeded up .
he said that every citizen who has a house in the city should have a hukou .
but the idea does n't appeal to expert wang feiling .
he says it will only aggravate social problems .
" mr zhou yongkang 's suggestion primarily benefits the rich , which is kind of a minority in the chinese society , " he says .
" it will also cause an internal capital drain .
it will further take capital away from poor rural areas to major urban centers .
people will invest money in major urban centers which are already very rich . "
tackling social inequality wang feiling is also not in favor of abolishing the hukou system .
he thinks it is not politically possible simply because the megacities have no reason to change the system .
moreover the city residents will also not give up their privileges .
wang feiling has another suggestion : " the most idealistic way of reforming the hukou system , i think , is not to abolish it overnight rather to empower the discriminated people to let the peasants , the people in the remote areas to organize themselves , to give them the private property right of a land , for example , to enrich them .
therefore , they will have less reasons to migrate to big cities . "
whatever happens to the reform of the hukou system , it is clear that tackling the social inequality between the city and the villages is going to be one of the main tasks of the chinese government in the next decade .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .

the survey showed " the americans ' thoroughly positive view of our country , " scharioth said .
the survey , commissioned by the german embassy , found that 48 percent of us citizens asked had an ' excellent ' or ' good ' general impression of germany , while 41 percent believed that germany and the us enjoyed ' excellent ' or ' good ' relations with one another .
these are the most positive results since the regular survey was first carried out in 2002 .

the dispute deepens the mutual mistrust between the two balkan countries . bosnia and serbia have both demanded custody of ejup ganic , the ex-bosnian deputy president who was arrested in london on monday for suspected war crimes .
serbia had issued an arrest warrant for ganic relating to an attack on a retreating convoy of the yugoslav people 's army in may 1992 that killed several soldiers and officers .
ganic denies the charges .
bosnia opened an investigation into the incident several years ago .
it claims the right to prosecute ganic , who now works at the university of sarajevo , under an agreement signed with serbia saying suspects wanted by both countries should be prosecuted in their country of residence .
" the prosecution considers that dealing with war crimes committed in bosnia-herzegovina by bosnian citizens is under its exclusive authority , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
warring judiciaries but a group of bosnian serb wartime detainees complained to belgrade that bosnia 's investigation was going too slowly .
in response , serbia launched its own probe into the incident last year , and has issued arrest warrants for 19 bosnian ex-officials , including ganic .
serbian justice minister snezana malovic told local media that belgrade would also seek to prosecute ganic .
" the ministry is working hard to prepare necessary documents and i expect that we will send an extradition request by the end of the week , " she said .
mutual mistrust many bosnians are skeptical of serbia 's justice system , which waited 18 months to indict an imprisoned bosnian former wartime official several years ago .
some openly question serbia 's motives in seeking extradition .
" this is aimed by serbian authorities to rehabilitate perpetrators of the crimes ... in bosnia-herzegovina and to demonize victims of the aggression of serbia , " said haris silajdzic , a muslim member of bosnia 's presidency .
bosnia 's 1992-1995 war between croats , muslims and serbs ended in the deaths of about 100,000 people .

some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .

a current pipeline project in myanmar will bring 12 million tonnes of crude oil from africa and the middle east through one pipeline and 12 billion cubic meters of burmese gas through another pipeline each year into china .
the nearly 1,000 kilometer long pipelines are said to be the longest in asia .
they will run through myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- to the south of china . 80 percent of china 's oil currently goes through the narrow strait of malacca , passing malaysia and indonesia , a strategically vulnerable zone with a history of piracy .
so china 's ambition to use myanmar 's strategic access to the indian ocean and avoid the strait will not only be a money-saving short cut .
concerns for human rights however , rights organizations are concerned that there will be human rights violations .
many fear this pipeline project could turn into a sequel to the yadana gas pipeline , a project connecting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in myanmar have been known to abuse human rights myanmar and thailand , which resulted in countless cases of rape , murder , forced labor and a large out-of-court settlement in 2004 between us energy giant unocal and burmese plaintiffs .
wong aung , coordinator of the shwe gas movement , which is speaking out loudly against the construction of the pipelines , says the estimated 29 billion dollars the burmese government is expected to gain out of these pipelines annually will be used to further suppress the burmese people .
" the beneficiaries of these pipeline projects have used this revenue to institutionalize the military and recruit chinese soldiers to come here and oppress the local people .
and we believe the local people are being forced to work on this pipeline as well . "
bernt berger , a german expert on myanmar , says forced labor is very likely to play a role in the construction of the pipelines , " this is a legitimate concern because it has been the practice over many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unocal pipeline , southeast asia .
burmese democracy groups and rebels voiced opposition towards the pipeline saying it will provide cash for myanmar 's military regime years and i think there 's no reason to believe that they wo n't do it in this case . "
forced labor , land confiscations , no compensation the military regime has already confiscated vast areas of land along the pipeline and given no compensation .
and many feel china is to blame .
but " china usually does not interfere into processes inside countries .
that means they would not provide any help to the population because they would think that is the job of the burmese government , " says berger .
berger believes that this approach has created some resentment among the population of myanmar , where for decades , china has been the main foreign investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in los angeles in 2004 , hoping to persuade unocal to leave myanmar , where it was accused of profiting from human rights abuses during a pipeline project .
" i think what is generally happening is a negative attitude towards chinese investors and chinese business people who come to burma but i do n't think in that region that there will be any unrest .
the area where unrest happens are more in the border areas among minorities and that is a big issue this year , where the elections are coming up . "
in august 2009 , when over 30,000 burmese belonging to an ethnic chinese minority fled myanmar to china after a military offensive against rebels in the area , beijing became quite unfriendly towards its ally - which goes to show that china 's policy of non-interference in myanmar has its limits .

even before the verdict , the case made history : a record number of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the existing law . germany 's federal constitutional court ruled tuesday that a privacy law concerning the mass storage of telephone and internet communication data was unconstitutional and should be thrown out .
according to the court , the provisions of the law in its current form were too vague .
however , the decision did not go so far as to rule out the storage of data outright .
the highly controversial law , in place since 2008 , required telecom companies to store data from telephone , mobile and e-mail communication , as well as internet surfing sessoins , for up to half a year .
that backlog of data must now be deleted , and no further data stored .
around 35,000 people opposed the law in germany 's largest class action suit , among them lawyers , doctors , journalists and politicians from the green party the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party , called the ruling a “ slap in the face of legislators ” who had been trying to walk all over the constitution .
before the ruling , burkhard hirsch , a member of the fdp , said the state had been “ treating citizens as potential offenders . "
law ' crucial ' in fighting terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the current law was ' too vague ' “ i though the law was correct , ” said peter altmaier , a christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- caucus leader , following the ruling in berlin .
“ i will respect the decision .
but i am not happy , that -lsb- the court -rsb- struck down the law . ”
he said without the data , the gathering of intelligence will now be much more difficult , though he didn ’ t expect german security to suffer . wolfgang bosbach , the cdu chairman of the federal internal affairs committee , warned earlier of the adverse consequences of the court ’ s decision for the fight against terrorism .
" supporters of terrorism are stealthy and highly communicative , and we need access to this data , " he told the daily bild newspaper on tuesday .
bosbach said such data is crucial to preventing terror attacks like those in madrid and london in 2004 and 2005 .
" there are no fingerprints , no traces of dna -lsb- online -rsb- .

it 's not the first time beijing has cracked down on the author . liao yiwu , known for being an outspoken critic of the chinese government , has been on beijing 's black list since the early 1990s , when he spent four years in jail for writing a poem about the 1989 massacre at tian 'anmen square .
he told deutsche welle in a telephone interview that he was on his way to frankfurt monday when he was removed from the plane in the southwest city of chengdu .
liao yiwu was taken to the local police station , where he waited for some time before being picked up by four police officers .
" they interrogated me and protocolled it and gave me a transcript .
they asked me where i wanted to go .
i told them i was going to the literature festival , lit.cologne , in germany , " said the 50-year-old writer .
" they photocopied my lit.cologne ticket and gave me a copy .
afterward , they told me i would not be allowed to go to cologne . "
liao said he explained to the police officers during the three-hour interrogation that lit.cologne was purely a literature festival and not of a political nature .
he was told that " it was a national matter " and he would have to inform the chinese authorities of his whereabouts .
berlin vows support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's book will still be read at the festival monday 's incident was the 13th time liao has been blocked from leaving china .
in october 2009 , he was barred from taking part in the frankfurt book fair , where china was the guest country .
berlin was aware of the possibility that liao 's travel could be hindered once again .
" the german government has sought repeatedly and at a high level to enable his travel , unfortunately without success , " foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin .
germany would " continue to campaign for freedom of opinion and human rights in an open dialogue with china , " he added .
the lit.cologne festival , which runs from march 11-20 , is a private event that combines classic literary readings with dialogue and discussion .
as one of the largest literature festivals in europe - 65,000 visitors attended last year - it would have given liao a large platform .
this year 's lit.cologne organizers say the planned reading from liao 's book " the corpse walker : real life stories : china from the bottom up " would take place on march 19 , regardless of whether or not the author is present .
when asked what he will do now , liao yiwu said he could n't do anything except wait at home : " i have nowhere to go .
it is a despairing situation . "

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

deutsche welle takes a look around . the world 's largest it and telecommunications trade fair , cebit , has opened in the northern german city of hanover .
more than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares .
among them , for the first time ever , is the american internet giant google , which has been causing some controversy in germany with its plans to launch street view .
sam edmonds , deutsche welle 's business editor and host of european business week , is in hanover , and had a look around .
google 's debut google is basically here at cebit to fly the flag .
it 's been under a lot of pressure , not just from the german government , but the french government as well , due to the library plans google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online .
so basically they 're using cebit as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of street view and other products like that .
cebit strives to regain its status i think to bounce back this year cebit is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds , i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos .
cebit began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that cebit really grew into this massive monster .
at its height , there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a futuristic apartment to explore , complete with gadgets to make life easier they 've now done a 180 degree turn .

futuristic housing there are quite a few things i 'm eager to check out personally .
i 'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment , which they 've got set up in hall 9 .
it 's about 400 square meters -lrb- 4,300 square feet -rrb- with a living room , a kitchen and even a gym .
it 's really looking at using computer systems and it for better living in the future , which includes greener living .
there 's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms .
in the kitchen there 's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you 're cooking and whether it 's healthy and part of a balanced diet .
if that does n't work , there 's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym , and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off .
the future of 3d technology there a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3d screens for their laptop and desktop computers .
they have a special coating , so if you do have 3d glasses on , you can get a very different feeling of depth perception .
this laptop technology is n't anywhere near what you 're going to see if you watch movies like avatar but it 's not too bad .
what is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience .
this technology , especially for home computers , is only being rolled out now .
i know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it 's a bit difficult to get used to but i guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers .

peta says the two can only be allowed to stay together if he is castrated . peta , the radical animal rights organization , known for its headline-grabbing stunts to put people off wearing furs , says that knut , germany 's most famous animal , should face one of the cruellest cuts of all .
as a cub , knut won the hearts of millions around the world after being rejected by his mother , to be successfully hand-reared in berlin zoo by his keeper , thomas doerflein , who slept on a mattress next to his crate each night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut even met leonardo dicaprio on the cover of vanity fair the knut cult knut 's fame was such that when he was presented to the public for the first time , on march 23 , 2007 , around 500 journalists from all over the world attended .
but fame is fickle and now the german branch of people for ethical treatment of animals , says that knut should be castrated because he is currently sharing an enclosure with gianna , who came to berlin from munich last year to keep knut company .
frank albrecht , the group 's zoo expert , has noted that gianna and knut have the same grandfather and are thus first cousins .
expert says castration necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut was reared by his foster father , berlin zookeeper thomas doerflein he says that any offspring would risk suffering from a condition known as " incest depression " .
albrecht has commented on knut before .
at the time of knut 's public debut , germany 's popular bild newspaper quoted him saying that knut should have been killed rather than been raised as a " domestic pet . "
this led to a national campaign with groups of children picketing the berlin zoo carrying placards reading " knut must live . "
albrecht , however , later insisted that he had been quoted out of context and that he had never really called for knut 's death. td / afp / apn editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" internet policy is currently handled by a number of ministries , which do n't always coordinate with each other , " bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there 's a lot happening , but there 's also a lot of confusion .
someone in the cabinet needs to coordinate internet policy ; the chancellor ca n't do it all . "
at the opening of the cebit trade show in hanover on monday , bitkom president august-wilhelm scheer suggested creating a new internet minister position , which would condense the cyberspace policymaking machinery of the various ministries into a single role .
scheer believes internet policy has become too fragmented and dispersed across the government , and that the world 's largest communications network is now too important – to both businesses and consumers – to leave important decisions about its use and governance to chance .
no easy sale but german chancellor angela merkel , at least for now , is n't sold on the idea .
" i do n't think -lrb- such -rrb- a minister is the solution , " she said in hanover .
" i think the economics minister , in his capacity as the person leading information and communications talks with the private sector , is in the best position to coordinate and develop it policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyberspace crime has become a pressing issue for governments and businesses the problem , says rohleder , is that even the economics minister does n't always know , or have control , over the internet policy decisions of other ministries , such as the ministry for consumer affairs and agriculture .
" the new position that we have in mind does n't necessarily have to be a minister , " rohleder said .
" it could be something like a secretary of state for the digital society or even some type of federal cio .
what 's important is that the person has the authority to coordinate policy across the government . "
ultimately , however , this new position would require both the federal ministries and powerful german states to surrender some control – a move that neither side is likely to make without putting up a fight , according to viktor mayer-schönberger , an internet policy expert and professor at the national university of singapore .
he sees a deeply rooted problem in the division between german states , which are responsible for the media , and the federal government , which is in charge of e-commerce .
" that makes for a terribly ineffective regulatory landscape in the internet age , where the differences between media , e-commerce and online services are breaking down , " he said .
mayer-schönberger has a solution but is n't willing to let the cat out of the box until he delivers a paper at a conference in germany later this month .

but forests in the cold northern hemisphere also play a key role in protecting the world 's climate . a crane effortlessly lifts one log after the other into the air .
for hours , trees are being loaded onto a truck in a clearing in the bikin river valley in far eastern russia at temperatures of minus 30 degrees celsius .
jewgeniy lepyoschkin , a forest expert at the worldwide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- office in vladivostok , takes one photograph after another . for once , what 's happening here in the bikin valley is a positive sign - the loggers must clear the area .
the wwf and the indigenous people of the region have sway over an area of 460,000 hectares of siberia 's bikin river valley that they 've leased from the russian government for the next 49 years to protect it from deforestation .
bildunterschrift : the bikin valley is threatened by illegal logging " the virgin forest here plays an important role in climate protection - our leased land alone captures some 48 million tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , " lepyoschkin said .
germany 's government and the german branch of the wwf are supporting the project within the framework of an international climate protection initiative .
they 're investing some 2,5 million euros in the project for three years .
after that , the leased land is to be financed through carbon credits .
a key region for the global climate large swathes of the bikin valley are covered by so-called boreal forests consisting of pine , spruce , birch and larch trees .
they 're called " taiga " in russian and account for more than a third of the worldwide forest cover and form a green belt north of the equator between the 40th and the 70th latitude .
some 60 percent of these forests lie in russia but the non-governmental organization " russian forest " estimates that only one to three percent of them are sufficiently protected .
that 's why the international " taiga rescue network , " has been supporting russian environment groups and indigenous peoples to protect the forest from large-scale tree logging and illegal felling .
" the boreal forests are a key ecological region , which can affect the climate on account of their sensitivity and size , " the network said in a recent report .
a ticking climate bomb boreal forests in canada and scandinavia are also threatened by unsustainable wood production and a steady exploitation of the region by humans .
environmental organization greenpeace has been campaigning for years in northern canada and finland to protect boreal forests from extensive logging for the paper industry .
as well as storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide , an intact boreal forest is also more resistant to the effects of global warming .
but just the opposite holds true for boreal forests which have lost their strongest hardwood trees , according to a study commissioned by greenpeace in canada .
bildunterschrift : forests in the northern hemisphere play a crucial role in protecting the global climate one of the biggest problems is the thawing of permafrost on ground that 's covered in large part by coniferous trees . that releases harmful gases such as methane that has been stored in the ground for centuries .
healthy forests would manage to capture it in the ground .
" as against that , a dying boreal forest could become a ticking climate bomb , " greenpeace forest expert oliver salge said .
tropics edge out boreal forests in public debate despite their importance , forests in cold regions of the world play a marginal role in debates over deforestation .
" unfortunately there 's a real perception gap in public opinion , " said frank moerschel from wwf germany , one of the coordinators of the bikin valley project .
" tropical forests and their protection seems more attractive and exotic because the images of falling giant trees that we see on television are so dramatic , " he said .
the changes in boreal forests may not be so visually spectacular , he said , but they 're just as " scandalous . "
" we ca n't afford to close our eyes to it . " while environmental activists have been granted the authority to protect the forests for the next 49 years , they hope that the russian state will give the region official protection status after that .
but that may happen sooner than expected thanks to the bikin valley 's famous amur tiger , which faces extinction .
in fall this year , politicians from countries which are home to tigers are to meet in vladivostok .
if russian premier vladimir putin makes the region 's protection a priority , then it wo n't just be the amur tiger that stand to profit .

europe is unaffected by the recall , spokespeople say . the gm recall follows a federal probe launched in january after more than a thousand drivers complained of power steering failures that made the us automaker 's vehicles hard to control .
the complaints included 14 crashes and one injury the recall in the us , canada and mexico affects 2005 to 2010 model year chevrolet cobalts , 2007 to 2010 pontiac g5s , 2005 and 2006 pontiac pursuits , 2005 and 2006 pontiac g4s .
a spokesman for chevrolet deutschland said the recall affects “ only north american and has nothing to do with germany or europe . ” a spokeswoman from opel , a subsidy of gm , confirmed that only north american cars were impacted by the recall but could not say whether any of the recalled cars had been imported into europe .
gm spokesman alan adler told the associated press the failures are rare and the cars can still be driven until the power steering motors are replaced .
the cars never lose their steering but may be harder to steer when traveling under 15 mph .
adler said it will take time for the automaker to receive 1.3 new power steering motors from its supplier , jtekt corp. , and gm will notify car owners when the parts are available .
the recall comes on the heels of a decision by japanese carmaker toyota to recall 8.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix sudden acceleration problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.03.2010 opinion : the state wants to fight terrorism with too much control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highest german court has overturned a law allowing anti-terror authorities to save data on phone calls and e-mails .
it 's only partly a victory for data protection advocates , says deutsche welle 's marcel fuerstenau . the storage of data without good reason violates the privacy of telecommunications , which is anchored in the constitution , so it is void ; all data stored must be deleted .
at first sight , the ruling by the highest german court seems to be an outright victory for the plaintiffs .
but that is not necessarily so .
according to the court , mass data storage as such is by no means incompatible with the constitution - the existing legislation is . basically , the judges are accusing lawmakers of doing a sloppy job . that was true , too , in the case of the law allowing spying on private computers , and in the case of the aviation security act that was aimed at allowing authorities to shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if innocent people were aboard .
the court approved of neither of these laws .
that does not mean that plans for more supervision in the name of security have been shelved .
on the contrary : tuesday 's ruling reads like a briefing .
stored data must be kept separately , it must be encrypted , and authorities must be able to control it in a transparent matter .
if these preconditions are fulfilled , then a judge could allow authorities to access the data .
another condition is that there must be particularly serious suspicion of a crime , which means a person or a community have to be seriously physically threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that sounds like a reassuringly high barrier to accessing data , but it is not as simple as that .
in the fight against terrorism , the state tends to show exaggerated caution .
over the years , there has been a rise in telephone and computer surveillance . in 2008 alone , police monitored telephones and computers in more than 5,300 cases ; the statistics do not list preventive eavesdropping .
that leaves room for speculation about the number of unreported cases .
this practice does not increase citizens ' trust in their country . in any case , the judiciary does not control the secret services ; they are controlled by a parliamentary committee that is sworn to secrecy .
all the same , media have repeatedly uncovered misconduct by the federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the fight against terrorism .
the opponents of exaggerated security laws can find consolation in the fact that the public is critical and it keeps an eye on those in power ; as they did in the current case of mass data storage .
a partly successful class action suit has put an immoderate legislator in his place .
there is reason for cautious optimism that civil rights and liberty will be dealt with more carefully in the future .
for one , the current justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger was one of those who filed the suit against the data storage law which was pushed through by a previous german government .
and on a european level , the european parliament now has more of a say in the matter than it did , thanks to the lisbon treaty . mercifully , the era of decisions being made by the eu commission on its own is over .
in september , the directive on mass data storage is up for critical examination by the european parliament .
