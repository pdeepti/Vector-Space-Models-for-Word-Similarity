while widely praised by rights campaigners , some question washington 's arbitrary record of punishing abusers . the pakistani military units , accused of abuses including extra-judicial killings and torture , are among those supported by the obama administration in the fight against the taliban and islamist extremists in the restive tribal regions along the hindu kush .
in accordance with the so-called leahy amendment - legislation brought in by senator patrick leahy in 1997 which prevents the us from providing assistance to foreign armed forces suspected of committing atrocities - washington will suspend training and equipment for about a half-dozen pakistani army units .
the cut will specifically affect pakistani special operations forces which have carried out attacks on the taliban in pakistan 's swat valley , including a large offensive targeting insurgents in 2009 , and a similar push in south waziristan earlier this year .
washington sources revealed that other pakistani units are also under investigation over alleged abuses and could join the list of those already cut off from us aid .
according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .
" we do not know at this time the specific allegations against each unit , " maria mcfarland , deputy director of human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- in washington , told deutsche welle . " however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .
" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 31.10.2010 ' tolerated residents ' make the most of an uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a conditional residency permit can make it hard to find work around 88,000 people live in germany without a residency permit .
their status here is in limbo , as they are stuck between residency and deportation .
a program in essen is helping some non-residents improve their lot . at the residency through work office in essen , aref ekinci has more bad news for his advisor .
the foreigners ' registration office has denied him a residency permit once again .
instead , he 's got a new duldung , or a conditional residency permit .
the name literally means " toleration , " and is a temporary measure that more or less states that while a person 's presence is tolerated , there has been no final decision on permanent residency or deportation .
ekinci has had such a permit for the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program pairs immigrants to work options the story of aref ekinci is typical of the 88,000 people whose residency in germany is not officially recognized .
ekinci , the son of a turkish guest worker , was born and raised in germany .
he went to school here and speaks perfect german .
in the 1990s , ekinci moved back to turkey and worked in the tourism industry .
but when he wanted to return to his family in essen five years ago , ekinci was not granted a residence permit from the foreign office .
" of course , the foreigners ' registration office always says ' we 'll see what we can do , " ' ekinci said .
" but you come back in three months and they 're still looking . "
ekinci is slowly getting the feeling that it could take quite a while .
" you 're here , " he said , " but somehow you actually are n't here in germany . "
a better chance it 's for people like ekinci , who have no secure status as a resident and face the possibility of deportation every day , that the residency through work program was created .
the program was initiated in february , 2009 by the youth welfare service and the church-run social welfare program in essen for youths and adults with a conditional residency permit who still have a chance at permanent residency in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships often lead to jobs a conditional permit has implications for work and everyday life .
it does n't necessarily make a good impression on an employer , who may worry that the worker could be suddenly deported .
and , a conditional permit limits a person 's ability to move .
in the state of north-rhine westphalia , ekinci is n't allowed to leave the state or travel .
" you 're at an overall disadvantage , " ekinci said .
people from many countries take part in the program , including serbia , bosnia , turkey , syria , iran , iraq and afghanistan .
some have been living in germany for 20 or 25 years , and others were even born here .
" our goal is to increase the chances of permanent residency through work and education , " said ina wolbeck , head of the project .
defeating the ‘ duldung ’ thirty participants take part in the program at the same time .
twice a week they take classes at aimed at improving their german as a working language , as well as math and politics .
they also work on data processing .
in the remaining three days of the week , they work at an internship or on a trial basis in a company of their choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lessons are part of the program taking part in the program makes that possible .
when employers know that the workers are there with the support of the program , then the fact that they are in germany with a conditional permit is not as much of a deterrent .
and , when participants are given the chance to show what they are capable of , an apprenticeship or a job is n't out of the question .
the project leaders work closely with the foreigners ' registration office in essen . it must approve every participant , and every two months , representatives from the office meet with residency through work team members and review the progress of each participant in the program .
" we try to see what we can do in each individual case to get the residency granted , " said wolbeck .
not about the numbers the program does n't have a fixed time frame ; participants stop coming when they find an apprenticeship or a job .
so far , of 67 participants who have done the program , a third were able to find a job or an apprenticeship .
but the numbers are n't the most important part of the program , says ekinci .
since starting the program , he 's found a part-time job and is hoping for a full-time position with a corporate security department .
" if i had just been sitting at home , i do n't think i would have had the confidence to send out the application , " he said .
but now , thanks to the residency through work program , he 's back on the job market .
" it gave me my self-confidence back , " he said .

in his letter , he explained his recantation with the fact that those nations who were liberated by islamists ultimately rejected the islamist worldview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri led the hofstadgroep and is now serving a life sentence " this has forced me to reconsider my views critically , and has led to the realization that they are untenable , " walters said in the letter .
walters expressed his disappointment with a utopian movement that has fallen short of its ideals .
" i have watched with horror how a once lofty ' struggle for freedom ' that should have been the go-ahead signal for a new , just world - especially in iraq - has turned into a bloody escalation of violence , sectarianism and religious mania , " he wrote .
" unheard of cruelty and crimes have been committed in the process . "
he said the random killing by islamists of innocent muslims had rendered the struggle for islamic rule " a total failure . "
the 25-year-old said he hoped his letter would serve " to warn youth not to be misguided by false promises and ideals . "
he called on islamists " to put down their weapons and employ other , productive methods " in order to bring about reforms instead of blaming the united states and the west .
lessons learned dutch commentator and de volkskrant columnist pieter hilhorst noted that walters , like other recanting islamists , explained his change of heart in analytical rather than personal terms .
" he does n't write that he regrets throwing a grenade at the police , " hilhorst said .
" he does n't write that he is ashamed of having glorified the murder of theo van gogh .
jason acts as if he was an observer , not a perpetrator . "
the lesson from recantations like that of walters , hilhorst said , is that appealing to islamists ' compassion in an effort to change their wayward means was meaningless as they " express no empathy with their non-muslim victims . "
" they are only concerned about the nature of the true muslim and the consequences for muslims , " he said .
" this last point is every jihadist 's real achilles heel .
the best way to draw him away from his violent belief is to ask him what he really wants to achieve .
that 's when facts become more important than divine inclination . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.10.2010 prominent dutch jihadist recants and denounces terrorism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of radical militants have chosen to renounce violence a key figure in one militant islamic european network has joined the ranks of a small but important number of jihadists to have a change of heart , calling on their brethren to abandon violence . the imprisoned dutch terrorism suspect jason walters said in an open letter that he has renounced islamic radicalism .
" the ideals that i once honored have been lost and i have come to realize that they are morally bankrupt , " walters said in what he called a " review document " written from the maximum-security prison in vught .
it was published recently in the dutch daily de volkskrant .
walters is a leading member of the jihadist hofstadgroep , made up of islamists primarily of moroccan origin .
the group was led by mohammed bouyeri , who is serving a life sentence for killing controversial dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in 2004 .
observers said walters ' letter offered a window into the mind of a man who had dedicated his life to propagating militant islam through violence .
it helped to understand why some adopt terrorism and what prompts them to reconsider .
walters ' review could also inform the increasingly partisan immigration debate in germany and other european nations about how to prevent the radicalization of immigrant youth and help them become functioning members of society .
a different denunciation walters was accused of plotting to kill controversial dutch parliamentarians geert wilders and ayaan hirsi ali .
he resisted his arrest in 2004 in a 14-hour siege during which he threw a grenade at police , injuring four policemen .
he has now served four years of his 15-year sentence .
born in the netherlands to an african-american soldier and a dutch mother , walters converted to islam at age 16 after the divorce of his parents and his father 's subsequent conversion .
in 2003 , he made his way to pakistan for training with jihadist groups .
he boasted on his return to the netherlands that he could " disassemble a kalashnikov blindfolded and put it back together again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali-born ayaan hirsi ali wrote the script for van gogh 's film " submission " walters ' denunciation is more political and philosophical than that of other jihadist ideologues which employed islamic theology to explain their change of heart , such as the libyan islamic fighting group -lrb- lifg -rrb- or sayyid imam al-sharif , one of the early associates of ayman al-zawahiri , al-qaeda 's second-in-command .
walters , on the other hand , takes issue in his letter with the basic tenant of his former worldview .
" the image that the world only exists of believers and infidels , in which the latter are motivated only to destroy the former , is a childish and coarse simplification of reality , " walters said .
" it ignores the complexity and many nuances of which reality is rich . "
analysts and counter-terrorism authorities say walters ' letter is likely to spark debate in militant islamist circles and serve as an important tool in efforts to counter jihadists in europe .
in a statement , the dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism -lrb- nctb -rrb- described it as " a remarkable document " not seen before in the netherlands .
dutch terrorism analyst edwin bakker from the netherlands institute of international relations clingendael said the letter would serve as " a good tool in the ideological fight against terrorists and islamists . "
a sincere document walters ' lawyer , bart nooitgedagt , rejected allegations that his client had written the letter in an effort to influence his appeal hearing .
an amsterdam court is set to determine whether the throwing of the grenade was a criminal or a terrorist act and whether the hofstadgroep was a terrorist organization .
the appeals court had ordered new proceedings in response to objections by the public prosecutor to the initial conviction of walters and his associates on criminal charges only .
of the seven defendants in the original case , walters is the only one still incarcerated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walters realized that violence is not the path to take in islam nooitgedagt said walters had written his letter some time ago , even though he only published it last week .
" jason anticipated the criticism , but assertions that the letter was inspired by dishonest motives are incorrect , " nooitgedagt said .
" the content of the letter is too fundamental for that . "
walters initially signaled his change of heart during the appeals court hearing in july , where he was the only defendant to appear in court in person .
" i was passive and uncooperative in the -lrb- lower -rrb- court in the hague , " walters told the court in a reference to his earlier rejection of the dutch justice system .
" but now i will actively defend myself .
i have confidence in the competence and the integrity of this court and in the dutch system . "

" the ideals that i once honored have been lost and i have come to realize that they are morally bankrupt , " walters said in what he called a " review document " written from the maximum-security prison in vught .
it was published recently in the dutch daily de volkskrant .
walters is a leading member of the jihadist hofstadgroep , made up of islamists primarily of moroccan origin .
the group was led by mohammed bouyeri , who is serving a life sentence for killing controversial dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in 2004 .
observers said walters ' letter offered a window into the mind of a man who had dedicated his life to propagating militant islam through violence .
it helped to understand why some adopt terrorism and what prompts them to reconsider .
walters ' review could also inform the increasingly partisan immigration debate in germany and other european nations about how to prevent the radicalization of immigrant youth and help them become functioning members of society .
a different denunciation walters was accused of plotting to kill controversial dutch parliamentarians geert wilders and ayaan hirsi ali .
he resisted his arrest in 2004 in a 14-hour siege during which he threw a grenade at police , injuring four policemen .
he has now served four years of his 15-year sentence .
born in the netherlands to an african-american soldier and a dutch mother , walters converted to islam at age 16 after the divorce of his parents and his father 's subsequent conversion .
in 2003 , he made his way to pakistan for training with jihadist groups .
he boasted on his return to the netherlands that he could " disassemble a kalashnikov blindfolded and put it back together again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali-born ayaan hirsi ali wrote the script for van gogh 's film " submission " walters ' denunciation is more political and philosophical than that of other jihadist ideologues which employed islamic theology to explain their change of heart , such as the libyan islamic fighting group -lrb- lifg -rrb- or sayyid imam al-sharif , one of the early associates of ayman al-zawahiri , al-qaeda 's second-in-command .
walters , on the other hand , takes issue in his letter with the basic tenant of his former worldview .
" the image that the world only exists of believers and infidels , in which the latter are motivated only to destroy the former , is a childish and coarse simplification of reality , " walters said .
" it ignores the complexity and many nuances of which reality is rich . "
analysts and counter-terrorism authorities say walters ' letter is likely to spark debate in militant islamist circles and serve as an important tool in efforts to counter jihadists in europe .
in a statement , the dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism -lrb- nctb -rrb- described it as " a remarkable document " not seen before in the netherlands .
dutch terrorism analyst edwin bakker from the netherlands institute of international relations clingendael said the letter would serve as " a good tool in the ideological fight against terrorists and islamists . "
a sincere document walters ' lawyer , bart nooitgedagt , rejected allegations that his client had written the letter in an effort to influence his appeal hearing .
an amsterdam court is set to determine whether the throwing of the grenade was a criminal or a terrorist act and whether the hofstadgroep was a terrorist organization .
the appeals court had ordered new proceedings in response to objections by the public prosecutor to the initial conviction of walters and his associates on criminal charges only .
of the seven defendants in the original case , walters is the only one still incarcerated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walters realized that violence is not the path to take in islam nooitgedagt said walters had written his letter some time ago , even though he only published it last week .
" jason anticipated the criticism , but assertions that the letter was inspired by dishonest motives are incorrect , " nooitgedagt said .
" the content of the letter is too fundamental for that . "
walters initially signaled his change of heart during the appeals court hearing in july , where he was the only defendant to appear in court in person .
" i was passive and uncooperative in the -lrb- lower -rrb- court in the hague , " walters told the court in a reference to his earlier rejection of the dutch justice system .
" but now i will actively defend myself .
i have confidence in the competence and the integrity of this court and in the dutch system . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.10.2010 prominent dutch jihadist recants and denounces terrorism back to first page back 2/2 a warning to youth nooitgedagt said walters ' change of heart was sparked by his reading of history books , as well as writings on the theory of evolution and the works of philosophers friedrich nietzsche and karl popper .
in his letter , he explained his recantation with the fact that those nations who were liberated by islamists ultimately rejected the islamist worldview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed bouyeri led the hofstadgroep and is now serving a life sentence " this has forced me to reconsider my views critically , and has led to the realization that they are untenable , " walters said in the letter .
walters expressed his disappointment with a utopian movement that has fallen short of its ideals .
" i have watched with horror how a once lofty ' struggle for freedom ' that should have been the go-ahead signal for a new , just world - especially in iraq - has turned into a bloody escalation of violence , sectarianism and religious mania , " he wrote .
" unheard of cruelty and crimes have been committed in the process . "
he said the random killing by islamists of innocent muslims had rendered the struggle for islamic rule " a total failure . "
the 25-year-old said he hoped his letter would serve " to warn youth not to be misguided by false promises and ideals . "
he called on islamists " to put down their weapons and employ other , productive methods " in order to bring about reforms instead of blaming the united states and the west .
lessons learned dutch commentator and de volkskrant columnist pieter hilhorst noted that walters , like other recanting islamists , explained his change of heart in analytical rather than personal terms .
" he does n't write that he regrets throwing a grenade at the police , " hilhorst said .
" he does n't write that he is ashamed of having glorified the murder of theo van gogh .
jason acts as if he was an observer , not a perpetrator . "
the lesson from recantations like that of walters , hilhorst said , is that appealing to islamists ' compassion in an effort to change their wayward means was meaningless as they " express no empathy with their non-muslim victims . "
" they are only concerned about the nature of the true muslim and the consequences for muslims , " he said .
" this last point is every jihadist 's real achilles heel .
the best way to draw him away from his violent belief is to ask him what he really wants to achieve .
that 's when facts become more important than divine inclination . "

their status here is in limbo , as they are stuck between residency and deportation .
a program in essen is helping some non-residents improve their lot . at the residency through work office in essen , aref ekinci has more bad news for his advisor .
the foreigners ' registration office has denied him a residency permit once again .
instead , he 's got a new duldung , or a conditional residency permit .
the name literally means " toleration , " and is a temporary measure that more or less states that while a person 's presence is tolerated , there has been no final decision on permanent residency or deportation .
ekinci has had such a permit for the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program pairs immigrants to work options the story of aref ekinci is typical of the 88,000 people whose residency in germany is not officially recognized .
ekinci , the son of a turkish guest worker , was born and raised in germany .
he went to school here and speaks perfect german .
in the 1990s , ekinci moved back to turkey and worked in the tourism industry .
but when he wanted to return to his family in essen five years ago , ekinci was not granted a residence permit from the foreign office .
" of course , the foreigners ' registration office always says ' we 'll see what we can do , " ' ekinci said .
" but you come back in three months and they 're still looking . "
ekinci is slowly getting the feeling that it could take quite a while .
" you 're here , " he said , " but somehow you actually are n't here in germany . "
a better chance it 's for people like ekinci , who have no secure status as a resident and face the possibility of deportation every day , that the residency through work program was created .
the program was initiated in february , 2009 by the youth welfare service and the church-run social welfare program in essen for youths and adults with a conditional residency permit who still have a chance at permanent residency in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships often lead to jobs a conditional permit has implications for work and everyday life .
it does n't necessarily make a good impression on an employer , who may worry that the worker could be suddenly deported .
and , a conditional permit limits a person 's ability to move .
in the state of north-rhine westphalia , ekinci is n't allowed to leave the state or travel .
" you 're at an overall disadvantage , " ekinci said .
people from many countries take part in the program , including serbia , bosnia , turkey , syria , iran , iraq and afghanistan .
some have been living in germany for 20 or 25 years , and others were even born here .
" our goal is to increase the chances of permanent residency through work and education , " said ina wolbeck , head of the project .
defeating the ‘ duldung ’ thirty participants take part in the program at the same time .
twice a week they take classes at aimed at improving their german as a working language , as well as math and politics .
they also work on data processing .
in the remaining three days of the week , they work at an internship or on a trial basis in a company of their choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lessons are part of the program taking part in the program makes that possible .
when employers know that the workers are there with the support of the program , then the fact that they are in germany with a conditional permit is not as much of a deterrent .
and , when participants are given the chance to show what they are capable of , an apprenticeship or a job is n't out of the question .
the project leaders work closely with the foreigners ' registration office in essen . it must approve every participant , and every two months , representatives from the office meet with residency through work team members and review the progress of each participant in the program .
" we try to see what we can do in each individual case to get the residency granted , " said wolbeck .
not about the numbers the program does n't have a fixed time frame ; participants stop coming when they find an apprenticeship or a job .
so far , of 67 participants who have done the program , a third were able to find a job or an apprenticeship .
but the numbers are n't the most important part of the program , says ekinci .
since starting the program , he 's found a part-time job and is hoping for a full-time position with a corporate security department .
" if i had just been sitting at home , i do n't think i would have had the confidence to send out the application , " he said .
but now , thanks to the residency through work program , he 's back on the job market .
" it gave me my self-confidence back , " he said .

the program was initiated in february , 2009 by the youth welfare service and the church-run social welfare program in essen for youths and adults with a conditional residency permit who still have a chance at permanent residency in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships often lead to jobs a conditional permit has implications for work and everyday life .
it does n't necessarily make a good impression on an employer , who may worry that the worker could be suddenly deported .
and , a conditional permit limits a person 's ability to move .
in the state of north-rhine westphalia , ekinci is n't allowed to leave the state or travel .
" you 're at an overall disadvantage , " ekinci said .
people from many countries take part in the program , including serbia , bosnia , turkey , syria , iran , iraq and afghanistan .
some have been living in germany for 20 or 25 years , and others were even born here .
" our goal is to increase the chances of permanent residency through work and education , " said ina wolbeck , head of the project .
defeating the ‘ duldung ’ thirty participants take part in the program at the same time .
twice a week they take classes at aimed at improving their german as a working language , as well as math and politics .
they also work on data processing .
in the remaining three days of the week , they work at an internship or on a trial basis in a company of their choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lessons are part of the program taking part in the program makes that possible .
when employers know that the workers are there with the support of the program , then the fact that they are in germany with a conditional permit is not as much of a deterrent .
and , when participants are given the chance to show what they are capable of , an apprenticeship or a job is n't out of the question .
the project leaders work closely with the foreigners ' registration office in essen . it must approve every participant , and every two months , representatives from the office meet with residency through work team members and review the progress of each participant in the program .
" we try to see what we can do in each individual case to get the residency granted , " said wolbeck .
not about the numbers the program does n't have a fixed time frame ; participants stop coming when they find an apprenticeship or a job .
so far , of 67 participants who have done the program , a third were able to find a job or an apprenticeship .
but the numbers are n't the most important part of the program , says ekinci .
since starting the program , he 's found a part-time job and is hoping for a full-time position with a corporate security department .
" if i had just been sitting at home , i do n't think i would have had the confidence to send out the application , " he said .
but now , thanks to the residency through work program , he 's back on the job market .
" it gave me my self-confidence back , " he said .

while widely praised by rights campaigners , some question washington 's arbitrary record of punishing abusers . the pakistani military units , accused of abuses including extra-judicial killings and torture , are among those supported by the obama administration in the fight against the taliban and islamist extremists in the restive tribal regions along the hindu kush .
in accordance with the so-called leahy amendment - legislation brought in by senator patrick leahy in 1997 which prevents the us from providing assistance to foreign armed forces suspected of committing atrocities - washington will suspend training and equipment for about a half-dozen pakistani army units .
the cut will specifically affect pakistani special operations forces which have carried out attacks on the taliban in pakistan 's swat valley , including a large offensive targeting insurgents in 2009 , and a similar push in south waziristan earlier this year .
washington sources revealed that other pakistani units are also under investigation over alleged abuses and could join the list of those already cut off from us aid .
according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .
" we do not know at this time the specific allegations against each unit , " maria mcfarland , deputy director of human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- in washington , told deutsche welle . " however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .
" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.10.2010 prominent dutch jihadist recants and denounces terrorism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of radical militants have chosen to renounce violence a key figure in one militant islamic european network has joined the ranks of a small but important number of jihadists to have a change of heart , calling on their brethren to abandon violence . the imprisoned dutch terrorism suspect jason walters said in an open letter that he has renounced islamic radicalism .
" the ideals that i once honored have been lost and i have come to realize that they are morally bankrupt , " walters said in what he called a " review document " written from the maximum-security prison in vught .
it was published recently in the dutch daily de volkskrant .
walters is a leading member of the jihadist hofstadgroep , made up of islamists primarily of moroccan origin .
the group was led by mohammed bouyeri , who is serving a life sentence for killing controversial dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in 2004 .
observers said walters ' letter offered a window into the mind of a man who had dedicated his life to propagating militant islam through violence .
it helped to understand why some adopt terrorism and what prompts them to reconsider .
walters ' review could also inform the increasingly partisan immigration debate in germany and other european nations about how to prevent the radicalization of immigrant youth and help them become functioning members of society .
a different denunciation walters was accused of plotting to kill controversial dutch parliamentarians geert wilders and ayaan hirsi ali .
he resisted his arrest in 2004 in a 14-hour siege during which he threw a grenade at police , injuring four policemen .
he has now served four years of his 15-year sentence .
born in the netherlands to an african-american soldier and a dutch mother , walters converted to islam at age 16 after the divorce of his parents and his father 's subsequent conversion .
in 2003 , he made his way to pakistan for training with jihadist groups .
he boasted on his return to the netherlands that he could " disassemble a kalashnikov blindfolded and put it back together again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali-born ayaan hirsi ali wrote the script for van gogh 's film " submission " walters ' denunciation is more political and philosophical than that of other jihadist ideologues which employed islamic theology to explain their change of heart , such as the libyan islamic fighting group -lrb- lifg -rrb- or sayyid imam al-sharif , one of the early associates of ayman al-zawahiri , al-qaeda 's second-in-command .
walters , on the other hand , takes issue in his letter with the basic tenant of his former worldview .
" the image that the world only exists of believers and infidels , in which the latter are motivated only to destroy the former , is a childish and coarse simplification of reality , " walters said .
" it ignores the complexity and many nuances of which reality is rich . "
analysts and counter-terrorism authorities say walters ' letter is likely to spark debate in militant islamist circles and serve as an important tool in efforts to counter jihadists in europe .
in a statement , the dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism -lrb- nctb -rrb- described it as " a remarkable document " not seen before in the netherlands .
dutch terrorism analyst edwin bakker from the netherlands institute of international relations clingendael said the letter would serve as " a good tool in the ideological fight against terrorists and islamists . "
a sincere document walters ' lawyer , bart nooitgedagt , rejected allegations that his client had written the letter in an effort to influence his appeal hearing .
an amsterdam court is set to determine whether the throwing of the grenade was a criminal or a terrorist act and whether the hofstadgroep was a terrorist organization .
the appeals court had ordered new proceedings in response to objections by the public prosecutor to the initial conviction of walters and his associates on criminal charges only .
of the seven defendants in the original case , walters is the only one still incarcerated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walters realized that violence is not the path to take in islam nooitgedagt said walters had written his letter some time ago , even though he only published it last week .
" jason anticipated the criticism , but assertions that the letter was inspired by dishonest motives are incorrect , " nooitgedagt said .
" the content of the letter is too fundamental for that . "
walters initially signaled his change of heart during the appeals court hearing in july , where he was the only defendant to appear in court in person .
" i was passive and uncooperative in the -lrb- lower -rrb- court in the hague , " walters told the court in a reference to his earlier rejection of the dutch justice system .
" but now i will actively defend myself .
i have confidence in the competence and the integrity of this court and in the dutch system . "

while widely praised by rights campaigners , some question washington 's arbitrary record of punishing abusers . the pakistani military units , accused of abuses including extra-judicial killings and torture , are among those supported by the obama administration in the fight against the taliban and islamist extremists in the restive tribal regions along the hindu kush .
in accordance with the so-called leahy amendment - legislation brought in by senator patrick leahy in 1997 which prevents the us from providing assistance to foreign armed forces suspected of committing atrocities - washington will suspend training and equipment for about a half-dozen pakistani army units .
the cut will specifically affect pakistani special operations forces which have carried out attacks on the taliban in pakistan 's swat valley , including a large offensive targeting insurgents in 2009 , and a similar push in south waziristan earlier this year .
washington sources revealed that other pakistani units are also under investigation over alleged abuses and could join the list of those already cut off from us aid .
according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .
" we do not know at this time the specific allegations against each unit , " maria mcfarland , deputy director of human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- in washington , told deutsche welle . " however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .
" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.10.2010 prominent dutch jihadist recants and denounces terrorism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of radical militants have chosen to renounce violence a key figure in one militant islamic european network has joined the ranks of a small but important number of jihadists to have a change of heart , calling on their brethren to abandon violence . the imprisoned dutch terrorism suspect jason walters said in an open letter that he has renounced islamic radicalism .
" the ideals that i once honored have been lost and i have come to realize that they are morally bankrupt , " walters said in what he called a " review document " written from the maximum-security prison in vught .
it was published recently in the dutch daily de volkskrant .
walters is a leading member of the jihadist hofstadgroep , made up of islamists primarily of moroccan origin .
the group was led by mohammed bouyeri , who is serving a life sentence for killing controversial dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in 2004 .
observers said walters ' letter offered a window into the mind of a man who had dedicated his life to propagating militant islam through violence .
it helped to understand why some adopt terrorism and what prompts them to reconsider .
walters ' review could also inform the increasingly partisan immigration debate in germany and other european nations about how to prevent the radicalization of immigrant youth and help them become functioning members of society .
a different denunciation walters was accused of plotting to kill controversial dutch parliamentarians geert wilders and ayaan hirsi ali .
he resisted his arrest in 2004 in a 14-hour siege during which he threw a grenade at police , injuring four policemen .
he has now served four years of his 15-year sentence .
born in the netherlands to an african-american soldier and a dutch mother , walters converted to islam at age 16 after the divorce of his parents and his father 's subsequent conversion .
in 2003 , he made his way to pakistan for training with jihadist groups .
he boasted on his return to the netherlands that he could " disassemble a kalashnikov blindfolded and put it back together again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali-born ayaan hirsi ali wrote the script for van gogh 's film " submission " walters ' denunciation is more political and philosophical than that of other jihadist ideologues which employed islamic theology to explain their change of heart , such as the libyan islamic fighting group -lrb- lifg -rrb- or sayyid imam al-sharif , one of the early associates of ayman al-zawahiri , al-qaeda 's second-in-command .
walters , on the other hand , takes issue in his letter with the basic tenant of his former worldview .
" the image that the world only exists of believers and infidels , in which the latter are motivated only to destroy the former , is a childish and coarse simplification of reality , " walters said .
" it ignores the complexity and many nuances of which reality is rich . "
analysts and counter-terrorism authorities say walters ' letter is likely to spark debate in militant islamist circles and serve as an important tool in efforts to counter jihadists in europe .
in a statement , the dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism -lrb- nctb -rrb- described it as " a remarkable document " not seen before in the netherlands .
dutch terrorism analyst edwin bakker from the netherlands institute of international relations clingendael said the letter would serve as " a good tool in the ideological fight against terrorists and islamists . "
a sincere document walters ' lawyer , bart nooitgedagt , rejected allegations that his client had written the letter in an effort to influence his appeal hearing .
an amsterdam court is set to determine whether the throwing of the grenade was a criminal or a terrorist act and whether the hofstadgroep was a terrorist organization .
the appeals court had ordered new proceedings in response to objections by the public prosecutor to the initial conviction of walters and his associates on criminal charges only .
of the seven defendants in the original case , walters is the only one still incarcerated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walters realized that violence is not the path to take in islam nooitgedagt said walters had written his letter some time ago , even though he only published it last week .
" jason anticipated the criticism , but assertions that the letter was inspired by dishonest motives are incorrect , " nooitgedagt said .
" the content of the letter is too fundamental for that . "
walters initially signaled his change of heart during the appeals court hearing in july , where he was the only defendant to appear in court in person .
" i was passive and uncooperative in the -lrb- lower -rrb- court in the hague , " walters told the court in a reference to his earlier rejection of the dutch justice system .
" but now i will actively defend myself .
i have confidence in the competence and the integrity of this court and in the dutch system . "

the foreigners ' registration office has denied him a residency permit once again .
instead , he 's got a new duldung , or a conditional residency permit .
the name literally means " toleration , " and is a temporary measure that more or less states that while a person 's presence is tolerated , there has been no final decision on permanent residency or deportation .
ekinci has had such a permit for the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program pairs immigrants to work options the story of aref ekinci is typical of the 88,000 people whose residency in germany is not officially recognized .
ekinci , the son of a turkish guest worker , was born and raised in germany .
he went to school here and speaks perfect german .
in the 1990s , ekinci moved back to turkey and worked in the tourism industry .
but when he wanted to return to his family in essen five years ago , ekinci was not granted a residence permit from the foreign office .
" of course , the foreigners ' registration office always says ' we 'll see what we can do , " ' ekinci said .
" but you come back in three months and they 're still looking . "
ekinci is slowly getting the feeling that it could take quite a while .
" you 're here , " he said , " but somehow you actually are n't here in germany . "
a better chance it 's for people like ekinci , who have no secure status as a resident and face the possibility of deportation every day , that the residency through work program was created .
the program was initiated in february , 2009 by the youth welfare service and the church-run social welfare program in essen for youths and adults with a conditional residency permit who still have a chance at permanent residency in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships often lead to jobs a conditional permit has implications for work and everyday life .
it does n't necessarily make a good impression on an employer , who may worry that the worker could be suddenly deported .
and , a conditional permit limits a person 's ability to move .
in the state of north-rhine westphalia , ekinci is n't allowed to leave the state or travel .
" you 're at an overall disadvantage , " ekinci said .
people from many countries take part in the program , including serbia , bosnia , turkey , syria , iran , iraq and afghanistan .
some have been living in germany for 20 or 25 years , and others were even born here .
" our goal is to increase the chances of permanent residency through work and education , " said ina wolbeck , head of the project .
defeating the ‘ duldung ’ thirty participants take part in the program at the same time .
twice a week they take classes at aimed at improving their german as a working language , as well as math and politics .
they also work on data processing .
in the remaining three days of the week , they work at an internship or on a trial basis in a company of their choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lessons are part of the program taking part in the program makes that possible .
when employers know that the workers are there with the support of the program , then the fact that they are in germany with a conditional permit is not as much of a deterrent .
and , when participants are given the chance to show what they are capable of , an apprenticeship or a job is n't out of the question .
the project leaders work closely with the foreigners ' registration office in essen . it must approve every participant , and every two months , representatives from the office meet with residency through work team members and review the progress of each participant in the program .
" we try to see what we can do in each individual case to get the residency granted , " said wolbeck .
not about the numbers the program does n't have a fixed time frame ; participants stop coming when they find an apprenticeship or a job .
so far , of 67 participants who have done the program , a third were able to find a job or an apprenticeship .
but the numbers are n't the most important part of the program , says ekinci .
since starting the program , he 's found a part-time job and is hoping for a full-time position with a corporate security department .
" if i had just been sitting at home , i do n't think i would have had the confidence to send out the application , " he said .
but now , thanks to the residency through work program , he 's back on the job market .
" it gave me my self-confidence back , " he said .

while widely praised by rights campaigners , some question washington 's arbitrary record of punishing abusers . the pakistani military units , accused of abuses including extra-judicial killings and torture , are among those supported by the obama administration in the fight against the taliban and islamist extremists in the restive tribal regions along the hindu kush .
in accordance with the so-called leahy amendment - legislation brought in by senator patrick leahy in 1997 which prevents the us from providing assistance to foreign armed forces suspected of committing atrocities - washington will suspend training and equipment for about a half-dozen pakistani army units .
the cut will specifically affect pakistani special operations forces which have carried out attacks on the taliban in pakistan 's swat valley , including a large offensive targeting insurgents in 2009 , and a similar push in south waziristan earlier this year .
washington sources revealed that other pakistani units are also under investigation over alleged abuses and could join the list of those already cut off from us aid .
according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .
" we do not know at this time the specific allegations against each unit , " maria mcfarland , deputy director of human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- in washington , told deutsche welle . " however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .
" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

while widely praised by rights campaigners , some question washington 's arbitrary record of punishing abusers . the pakistani military units , accused of abuses including extra-judicial killings and torture , are among those supported by the obama administration in the fight against the taliban and islamist extremists in the restive tribal regions along the hindu kush .
in accordance with the so-called leahy amendment - legislation brought in by senator patrick leahy in 1997 which prevents the us from providing assistance to foreign armed forces suspected of committing atrocities - washington will suspend training and equipment for about a half-dozen pakistani army units .
the cut will specifically affect pakistani special operations forces which have carried out attacks on the taliban in pakistan 's swat valley , including a large offensive targeting insurgents in 2009 , and a similar push in south waziristan earlier this year .
washington sources revealed that other pakistani units are also under investigation over alleged abuses and could join the list of those already cut off from us aid .
according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .
" we do not know at this time the specific allegations against each unit , " maria mcfarland , deputy director of human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- in washington , told deutsche welle . " however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .

the party 's leader hit back at accusations of extremism . the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- voted to take a tough stance against immigrants who fail to integrate into german society at a party conference in munich on saturday .
included in a new seven-point plan were proposals for " unspecified sanctions for parents who hinder their children from integrating into the german way of life or who themselves decline to integrate by learning german . "
the plan , which stipulates that permanent residents must accept a " leading " role for german culture in society , was approved unanimously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party says parents who hinder childrens ' integration should face sanctions also contained were proposals to tackle skills shortages by training existing immigrants , who would also be required to learn better german , rather than allowing new migrants to enter the country .
in its policy , the csu - sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats - said that skills shortages should not be considered " carte blanche " for unrestricted immigration .
however , the document did contain provision to ease restrictions on offering long-term residency to immigrants earning high salaries . leading role for german culture speaking at the conference , party leader horst seehofer denied claims that he was pandering to the extreme right following controversy over his call for an end to immigration from alien cultures - in particular from islamic countries .
" if what i say is radically right wing , then two-thirds of the population is radically right wing , " seehofer said .
" we should not be timid about saying that we stand for german culture taking a leading role . "
german values were " based on christianity and rooted in judaism , " seehofer added .
" they are not informed by islam and that must remain the case . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel told the conference on friday that multiculturalism had failed the policy vote came as chancellor merkel said that more people of an immigrant origin should be employed in the public sector .
" people of migrant origin are under-represented in government services , " merkel said in a video message posted on the chancellery website on saturday .
" this has to change . "
but those comments came one day after the chancellor reiterated her opinion , stated several weeks ago , that multiculturalism in germany had failed .
the comments are the latest in a national debate in germany about a perceived failure of the country 's turkish and arab community to integrate .
question of leadership the new policy was drafted by the leadership of the csu , considered the most conservative of germany 's mainstream parties .
another talking point of the conference was the growing popularity of the party 's rising star - defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg – which drew a barbed comment from seehofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg is seen as a likely successor to seehofer " germany does n't just consist of karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
neither does the csu , " said seehofer , 61 .
many see the younger , popular guttenberg as his likely successor .
during the two-day event the csu also abandoned its long-standing support for military conscription and voted in favor of restructuring the armed forces .
the party also voted to introduce a quota that would require that 40 percent of the high-level positions in the party be filled by women .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg is seen as a likely successor to seehofer " germany does n't just consist of karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
neither does the csu , " said seehofer , 61 .
many see the younger , popular guttenberg as his likely successor .
during the two-day event the csu also abandoned its long-standing support for military conscription and voted in favor of restructuring the armed forces .
the party also voted to introduce a quota that would require that 40 percent of the high-level positions in the party be filled by women .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister socrates threatened to quit if the budget were not passed the agreement reaffirms the goal of reaching a public deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp by the end of 2011 , in contrast to the 7.3 percent expected for this year .
" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .
unions have responded to the planned austerity measures with a call for a general strike on november 24 .

on friday , authorities discovered explosives in two packages being sent from yemen to synagogues in the us . the german government announced on sunday that it had stopped all inbound freight deliveries from yemen , after parcel bombs bound for us synagogues were intercepted from two passenger planes earlier in the week .
" the german government has ordered a stop to freight to germany from yemen until further notice , " interior minister thomas de maiziere told german public radio .
" this is a joint action with the united states , great britain , and france . "
airlines , freight forwarders and couriers have been ordered to closely examine every consignment originating from yemen which either arrives despite the ban or which is already being held in storage en route to its destination .
germany 's postal service , deutsche post - which is also the parent of germany 's global courier giant dhl - said it was already running special checks on all incoming parcels from yemen .

" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .
leverkusen beat struggling schalke 1-0 on saturday .

the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .
leverkusen beat struggling schalke 1-0 on saturday .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .

on friday , authorities discovered explosives in two packages being sent from yemen to synagogues in the us . the german government announced on sunday that it had stopped all inbound freight deliveries from yemen , after parcel bombs bound for us synagogues were intercepted from two passenger planes earlier in the week .
" the german government has ordered a stop to freight to germany from yemen until further notice , " interior minister thomas de maiziere told german public radio .
" this is a joint action with the united states , great britain , and france . "
airlines , freight forwarders and couriers have been ordered to closely examine every consignment originating from yemen which either arrives despite the ban or which is already being held in storage en route to its destination .
germany 's postal service , deutsche post - which is also the parent of germany 's global courier giant dhl - said it was already running special checks on all incoming parcels from yemen .
yemen police on sunday released a university student arrested the day before on suspicion of having links to the two parcels containing explosives found on us-bound flights .

mid east visit postponed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister is needed closer to home for now the german interior minister has also called off his planned trip to the middle east for the time being .
de maiziere had been scheduled to attend a conference on homeland security in tel aviv , hold talks with israeli investors , and discuss the ground-breaking prospect of four new , german-financed police stations in the west bank city of ramallah .
" our security boss needs to stay at the helm , " a spokesman for the interior ministry told reporters , saying that the continuing investigation into the bomb plot would force the interior minister to stay on german soil .
" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .
speaking in dresden , de maiziere said german authorities received the tip between late thursday and early friday that explosives were inside a us-bound parcel .
germany 's federal crime office , the bka , then discovered the package 's consignment number and notified the british authorities .
bombs touched down in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities were too late to nab the explosives in germany the intelligence came in too late , however , to intercept the explosives while they were on german soil .
authorities confirmed on saturday that the package went through cologne / bonn airport en route to east midlands airport , north of london .
by the time the authorities had identified the offending package , they were too late to stop it taking off from the western german airport .
" it was already on the way to britain , " a bka spokeswoman said .
" we managed to inform our partners in london so that they were able to look specifically for the package and find it . "
" we are taking this situation very seriously , even though it seems that germany was not the target of the attack , " interior minister thomas de maiziere said of the incident , announcing an investigation into whether there are gaps in the policing of air freight security .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .

on friday , authorities discovered explosives in two packages being sent from yemen to synagogues in the us . the german government announced on sunday that it had stopped all inbound freight deliveries from yemen , after parcel bombs bound for us synagogues were intercepted from two passenger planes earlier in the week .
" the german government has ordered a stop to freight to germany from yemen until further notice , " interior minister thomas de maiziere told german public radio .
" this is a joint action with the united states , great britain , and france . "
airlines , freight forwarders and couriers have been ordered to closely examine every consignment originating from yemen which either arrives despite the ban or which is already being held in storage en route to its destination .
germany 's postal service , deutsche post - which is also the parent of germany 's global courier giant dhl - said it was already running special checks on all incoming parcels from yemen .
yemen police on sunday released a university student arrested the day before on suspicion of having links to the two parcels containing explosives found on us-bound flights .
one package was intercepted at britain 's east midlands airport , and another at a freight center in dubai .
they were bound for two synagogues in chicago .

" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .
speaking in dresden , de maiziere said german authorities received the tip between late thursday and early friday that explosives were inside a us-bound parcel .

by the time the authorities had identified the offending package , they were too late to stop it taking off from the western german airport .

" we managed to inform our partners in london so that they were able to look specifically for the package and find it . "

yemen police on sunday released a university student arrested the day before on suspicion of having links to the two parcels containing explosives found on us-bound flights .
one package was intercepted at britain 's east midlands airport , and another at a freight center in dubai .
they were bound for two synagogues in chicago .
mid east visit postponed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister is needed closer to home for now the german interior minister has also called off his planned trip to the middle east for the time being .
de maiziere had been scheduled to attend a conference on homeland security in tel aviv , hold talks with israeli investors , and discuss the ground-breaking prospect of four new , german-financed police stations in the west bank city of ramallah .
" our security boss needs to stay at the helm , " a spokesman for the interior ministry told reporters , saying that the continuing investigation into the bomb plot would force the interior minister to stay on german soil .
" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .
speaking in dresden , de maiziere said german authorities received the tip between late thursday and early friday that explosives were inside a us-bound parcel .
germany 's federal crime office , the bka , then discovered the package 's consignment number and notified the british authorities .
bombs touched down in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities were too late to nab the explosives in germany the intelligence came in too late , however , to intercept the explosives while they were on german soil .
authorities confirmed on saturday that the package went through cologne / bonn airport en route to east midlands airport , north of london .
by the time the authorities had identified the offending package , they were too late to stop it taking off from the western german airport .
" it was already on the way to britain , " a bka spokeswoman said .
" we managed to inform our partners in london so that they were able to look specifically for the package and find it . "
" we are taking this situation very seriously , even though it seems that germany was not the target of the attack , " interior minister thomas de maiziere said of the incident , announcing an investigation into whether there are gaps in the policing of air freight security .
an alleged bombmaker from saudi arabia emerged as the key suspect behind the parcel bombs , a us official said on sunday . author : mark hallam -lrb- apn , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister socrates threatened to quit if the budget were not passed the agreement reaffirms the goal of reaching a public deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp by the end of 2011 , in contrast to the 7.3 percent expected for this year .
" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .
unions have responded to the planned austerity measures with a call for a general strike on november 24 .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister socrates threatened to quit if the budget were not passed the agreement reaffirms the goal of reaching a public deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp by the end of 2011 , in contrast to the 7.3 percent expected for this year .
" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .
unions have responded to the planned austerity measures with a call for a general strike on november 24 .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister socrates threatened to quit if the budget were not passed the agreement reaffirms the goal of reaching a public deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp by the end of 2011 , in contrast to the 7.3 percent expected for this year .
" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .
unions have responded to the planned austerity measures with a call for a general strike on november 24 .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "

" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 31.10.2010 portuguese government seals deal on austerity budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government faces tough spending choices portugal 's minority socialist government has reached a deal with the country 's center-right opposition to introduce an austerity budget .
the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister socrates threatened to quit if the budget were not passed the agreement reaffirms the goal of reaching a public deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp by the end of 2011 , in contrast to the 7.3 percent expected for this year .
" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .
unions have responded to the planned austerity measures with a call for a general strike on november 24 .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister socrates threatened to quit if the budget were not passed the agreement reaffirms the goal of reaching a public deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp by the end of 2011 , in contrast to the 7.3 percent expected for this year .
" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .
unions have responded to the planned austerity measures with a call for a general strike on november 24 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 31.10.2010 ' tolerated residents ' make the most of an uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a conditional residency permit can make it hard to find work around 88,000 people live in germany without a residency permit .
their status here is in limbo , as they are stuck between residency and deportation .
a program in essen is helping some non-residents improve their lot . at the residency through work office in essen , aref ekinci has more bad news for his advisor .
the foreigners ' registration office has denied him a residency permit once again .
instead , he 's got a new duldung , or a conditional residency permit .
the name literally means " toleration , " and is a temporary measure that more or less states that while a person 's presence is tolerated , there has been no final decision on permanent residency or deportation .
ekinci has had such a permit for the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program pairs immigrants to work options the story of aref ekinci is typical of the 88,000 people whose residency in germany is not officially recognized .
ekinci , the son of a turkish guest worker , was born and raised in germany .
he went to school here and speaks perfect german .
in the 1990s , ekinci moved back to turkey and worked in the tourism industry .
but when he wanted to return to his family in essen five years ago , ekinci was not granted a residence permit from the foreign office .
" of course , the foreigners ' registration office always says ' we 'll see what we can do , " ' ekinci said .
" but you come back in three months and they 're still looking . "
ekinci is slowly getting the feeling that it could take quite a while .
" you 're here , " he said , " but somehow you actually are n't here in germany . "
a better chance it 's for people like ekinci , who have no secure status as a resident and face the possibility of deportation every day , that the residency through work program was created .
the program was initiated in february , 2009 by the youth welfare service and the church-run social welfare program in essen for youths and adults with a conditional residency permit who still have a chance at permanent residency in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships often lead to jobs a conditional permit has implications for work and everyday life .
it does n't necessarily make a good impression on an employer , who may worry that the worker could be suddenly deported .
and , a conditional permit limits a person 's ability to move .
in the state of north-rhine westphalia , ekinci is n't allowed to leave the state or travel .
" you 're at an overall disadvantage , " ekinci said .
people from many countries take part in the program , including serbia , bosnia , turkey , syria , iran , iraq and afghanistan .
some have been living in germany for 20 or 25 years , and others were even born here .
" our goal is to increase the chances of permanent residency through work and education , " said ina wolbeck , head of the project .
defeating the ‘ duldung ’ thirty participants take part in the program at the same time .
twice a week they take classes at aimed at improving their german as a working language , as well as math and politics .
they also work on data processing .
in the remaining three days of the week , they work at an internship or on a trial basis in a company of their choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lessons are part of the program taking part in the program makes that possible .
when employers know that the workers are there with the support of the program , then the fact that they are in germany with a conditional permit is not as much of a deterrent .
and , when participants are given the chance to show what they are capable of , an apprenticeship or a job is n't out of the question .
the project leaders work closely with the foreigners ' registration office in essen . it must approve every participant , and every two months , representatives from the office meet with residency through work team members and review the progress of each participant in the program .
" we try to see what we can do in each individual case to get the residency granted , " said wolbeck .
not about the numbers the program does n't have a fixed time frame ; participants stop coming when they find an apprenticeship or a job .
so far , of 67 participants who have done the program , a third were able to find a job or an apprenticeship .
but the numbers are n't the most important part of the program , says ekinci .
since starting the program , he 's found a part-time job and is hoping for a full-time position with a corporate security department .
" if i had just been sitting at home , i do n't think i would have had the confidence to send out the application , " he said .
but now , thanks to the residency through work program , he 's back on the job market .
" it gave me my self-confidence back , " he said .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .
leverkusen beat struggling schalke 1-0 on saturday .

on friday , authorities discovered explosives in two packages being sent from yemen to synagogues in the us . the german government announced on sunday that it had stopped all inbound freight deliveries from yemen , after parcel bombs bound for us synagogues were intercepted from two passenger planes earlier in the week .
" the german government has ordered a stop to freight to germany from yemen until further notice , " interior minister thomas de maiziere told german public radio .
" this is a joint action with the united states , great britain , and france . "
airlines , freight forwarders and couriers have been ordered to closely examine every consignment originating from yemen which either arrives despite the ban or which is already being held in storage en route to its destination .
germany 's postal service , deutsche post - which is also the parent of germany 's global courier giant dhl - said it was already running special checks on all incoming parcels from yemen .
yemen police on sunday released a university student arrested the day before on suspicion of having links to the two parcels containing explosives found on us-bound flights .
one package was intercepted at britain 's east midlands airport , and another at a freight center in dubai .
they were bound for two synagogues in chicago .
mid east visit postponed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister is needed closer to home for now the german interior minister has also called off his planned trip to the middle east for the time being .
de maiziere had been scheduled to attend a conference on homeland security in tel aviv , hold talks with israeli investors , and discuss the ground-breaking prospect of four new , german-financed police stations in the west bank city of ramallah .
" our security boss needs to stay at the helm , " a spokesman for the interior ministry told reporters , saying that the continuing investigation into the bomb plot would force the interior minister to stay on german soil .
" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .
speaking in dresden , de maiziere said german authorities received the tip between late thursday and early friday that explosives were inside a us-bound parcel .
germany 's federal crime office , the bka , then discovered the package 's consignment number and notified the british authorities .
bombs touched down in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities were too late to nab the explosives in germany the intelligence came in too late , however , to intercept the explosives while they were on german soil .
authorities confirmed on saturday that the package went through cologne / bonn airport en route to east midlands airport , north of london .
by the time the authorities had identified the offending package , they were too late to stop it taking off from the western german airport .
" it was already on the way to britain , " a bka spokeswoman said .
" we managed to inform our partners in london so that they were able to look specifically for the package and find it . "
" we are taking this situation very seriously , even though it seems that germany was not the target of the attack , " interior minister thomas de maiziere said of the incident , announcing an investigation into whether there are gaps in the policing of air freight security .

on friday , authorities discovered explosives in two packages being sent from yemen to synagogues in the us . the german government announced on sunday that it had stopped all inbound freight deliveries from yemen , after parcel bombs bound for us synagogues were intercepted from two passenger planes earlier in the week .
" the german government has ordered a stop to freight to germany from yemen until further notice , " interior minister thomas de maiziere told german public radio .
" this is a joint action with the united states , great britain , and france . "
airlines , freight forwarders and couriers have been ordered to closely examine every consignment originating from yemen which either arrives despite the ban or which is already being held in storage en route to its destination .
germany 's postal service , deutsche post - which is also the parent of germany 's global courier giant dhl - said it was already running special checks on all incoming parcels from yemen .
yemen police on sunday released a university student arrested the day before on suspicion of having links to the two parcels containing explosives found on us-bound flights .
one package was intercepted at britain 's east midlands airport , and another at a freight center in dubai .
they were bound for two synagogues in chicago .
mid east visit postponed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister is needed closer to home for now the german interior minister has also called off his planned trip to the middle east for the time being .
de maiziere had been scheduled to attend a conference on homeland security in tel aviv , hold talks with israeli investors , and discuss the ground-breaking prospect of four new , german-financed police stations in the west bank city of ramallah .
" our security boss needs to stay at the helm , " a spokesman for the interior ministry told reporters , saying that the continuing investigation into the bomb plot would force the interior minister to stay on german soil .
" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .
speaking in dresden , de maiziere said german authorities received the tip between late thursday and early friday that explosives were inside a us-bound parcel .
germany 's federal crime office , the bka , then discovered the package 's consignment number and notified the british authorities .
bombs touched down in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities were too late to nab the explosives in germany the intelligence came in too late , however , to intercept the explosives while they were on german soil .
authorities confirmed on saturday that the package went through cologne / bonn airport en route to east midlands airport , north of london .
by the time the authorities had identified the offending package , they were too late to stop it taking off from the western german airport .
" it was already on the way to britain , " a bka spokeswoman said .
" we managed to inform our partners in london so that they were able to look specifically for the package and find it . "
" we are taking this situation very seriously , even though it seems that germany was not the target of the attack , " interior minister thomas de maiziere said of the incident , announcing an investigation into whether there are gaps in the policing of air freight security .
an alleged bombmaker from saudi arabia emerged as the key suspect behind the parcel bombs , a us official said on sunday . author : mark hallam -lrb- apn , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party 's leader hit back at accusations of extremism . the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- voted to take a tough stance against immigrants who fail to integrate into german society at a party conference in munich on saturday .
included in a new seven-point plan were proposals for " unspecified sanctions for parents who hinder their children from integrating into the german way of life or who themselves decline to integrate by learning german . "
the plan , which stipulates that permanent residents must accept a " leading " role for german culture in society , was approved unanimously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party says parents who hinder childrens ' integration should face sanctions also contained were proposals to tackle skills shortages by training existing immigrants , who would also be required to learn better german , rather than allowing new migrants to enter the country .
in its policy , the csu - sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats - said that skills shortages should not be considered " carte blanche " for unrestricted immigration .
however , the document did contain provision to ease restrictions on offering long-term residency to immigrants earning high salaries . leading role for german culture speaking at the conference , party leader horst seehofer denied claims that he was pandering to the extreme right following controversy over his call for an end to immigration from alien cultures - in particular from islamic countries .
" if what i say is radically right wing , then two-thirds of the population is radically right wing , " seehofer said .
" we should not be timid about saying that we stand for german culture taking a leading role . "
german values were " based on christianity and rooted in judaism , " seehofer added .
" they are not informed by islam and that must remain the case . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel told the conference on friday that multiculturalism had failed the policy vote came as chancellor merkel said that more people of an immigrant origin should be employed in the public sector .
" people of migrant origin are under-represented in government services , " merkel said in a video message posted on the chancellery website on saturday .
" this has to change . "
but those comments came one day after the chancellor reiterated her opinion , stated several weeks ago , that multiculturalism in germany had failed .
the comments are the latest in a national debate in germany about a perceived failure of the country 's turkish and arab community to integrate .
question of leadership the new policy was drafted by the leadership of the csu , considered the most conservative of germany 's mainstream parties .
another talking point of the conference was the growing popularity of the party 's rising star - defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg – which drew a barbed comment from seehofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg is seen as a likely successor to seehofer " germany does n't just consist of karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
neither does the csu , " said seehofer , 61 .
many see the younger , popular guttenberg as his likely successor .
during the two-day event the csu also abandoned its long-standing support for military conscription and voted in favor of restructuring the armed forces .
the party also voted to introduce a quota that would require that 40 percent of the high-level positions in the party be filled by women .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .

while widely praised by rights campaigners , some question washington 's arbitrary record of punishing abusers . the pakistani military units , accused of abuses including extra-judicial killings and torture , are among those supported by the obama administration in the fight against the taliban and islamist extremists in the restive tribal regions along the hindu kush .
in accordance with the so-called leahy amendment - legislation brought in by senator patrick leahy in 1997 which prevents the us from providing assistance to foreign armed forces suspected of committing atrocities - washington will suspend training and equipment for about a half-dozen pakistani army units .
the cut will specifically affect pakistani special operations forces which have carried out attacks on the taliban in pakistan 's swat valley , including a large offensive targeting insurgents in 2009 , and a similar push in south waziristan earlier this year .
washington sources revealed that other pakistani units are also under investigation over alleged abuses and could join the list of those already cut off from us aid .
according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .
" we do not know at this time the specific allegations against each unit , " maria mcfarland , deputy director of human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- in washington , told deutsche welle . " however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .
" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

the democrats are predicted to lose their majority in the house . three days before the congressional election in the united states , president barack obama was working to avert the predicted loss of votes for his democrats .
at campaign events on saturday , he attempted to mobilize disappointed supporters to vote on november 2 . obama acknowledges difficulties because many americans are dissatisfied with the policies of the government , the democrats could face a massive loss of seats in the senate and house of representatives in the upcoming ballot .
disappointed voters accuse obama of failing to keep the campaign promises he made two years ago .
after appearances in pennsylvania and connecticut , obama told thousands of supporters in his hometown of chicago , illinois , that the election would be difficult .
he urged the crowd not to be discouraged in the struggle for reform .
" i want everybody here to understand - do n't let anybody tell you that this fight has n't been worth it , " he implored the audience of about 35,000 .
the rally in hyde park was his first public appearance in chicago since the victory celebration following the 2008 presidential election .
fun on the mall in washington , meanwhile , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against a political polarization in the country .
supporters gathered at washington 's national mall for the ' rally to restore sanity ' , hosted by the prominent television satirists jon stewart and stephen colbert .
the festive atmosphere around the capitol was heightened as many people attend in halloween costumes , holding signs poking fun at conservatives who accuse president barack obama of pursuing a socialist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters disrupted obama 's get-out-the-vote rally stewart and colbert each host mock news programs on tv channel comedy central , where they deliver the day 's events with biting wit .
politically , they are close to the democrats .
the initiative is a response to an august rally hosted by ultra-conservative fox news host glenn beck .
at least 80,000 supporters of the " tea party " movement followed beck 's call to demonstrate in support of " restoring honor " against the " socialist " policies of obama 's government .
poisoning the political climate stewart and colbert accuse the " tea party " of poisoning the political climate with polemical attacks on obama .
the movement routinely labels the us president a communist .
the " tea party " has criticized obama 's health care reforms and tightened control of financial markets as unfair state intervention in individual freedom .
the democrats have a reason to fear that on 2 november , they 'll lose their majority in the house of representatives .
according to polls , republicans stand to gain even more than the 39 seats they need to control that chamber .
in the senate , the race is closer .
there , the republicans would need to gain 10 seats to secure the coveted majority .

according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .

" however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .
" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 31.10.2010 freeze on pakistani military aid raises questions over us abuse policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the alleged abuses took place in the swat region alleged human rights violations have forced the us to withhold aid to a number of pakistani military units .
while widely praised by rights campaigners , some question washington 's arbitrary record of punishing abusers . the pakistani military units , accused of abuses including extra-judicial killings and torture , are among those supported by the obama administration in the fight against the taliban and islamist extremists in the restive tribal regions along the hindu kush .
in accordance with the so-called leahy amendment - legislation brought in by senator patrick leahy in 1997 which prevents the us from providing assistance to foreign armed forces suspected of committing atrocities - washington will suspend training and equipment for about a half-dozen pakistani army units .
the cut will specifically affect pakistani special operations forces which have carried out attacks on the taliban in pakistan 's swat valley , including a large offensive targeting insurgents in 2009 , and a similar push in south waziristan earlier this year .
washington sources revealed that other pakistani units are also under investigation over alleged abuses and could join the list of those already cut off from us aid .
according to the human rights commission of pakistan , a non-governmental organization , 282 extra-judicial killings were committed in the swat region during the 2009 offensive , including the killing and torture of civilians and unarmed taliban prisoners .
it is also claimed that around 3,000 unacknowledged suspects are being held without counsel in temporary prisons in the region .
" we do not know at this time the specific allegations against each unit , " maria mcfarland , deputy director of human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- in washington , told deutsche welle . " however , hrw has received credible reports of numerous cases of extrajudicial executions , torture , and mistreatment by the pakistani army in the swat valley . we have also documented cases of collective punishment against civilians related to persons the army suspects of being taliban militants . we have been urging the united states for several months to apply the leahy law to the responsible units . " " we know that the abuses by the pakistani army were the subject of intense debate and concern within the us government , " she added .
" the evidence of such abuses is substantial , and pakistan has made no effort to bring those responsible to justice .
the us is right to cut off responsible units and insist on meaningful investigations and accountability . "
crackdown in swat , south waziristan lead to abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani forces have been targeting taliban insurgents the us was forced to act after a video surfaced on the internet supposedly showing soldiers in pakistani military uniforms executing six young men wearing civilian clothes .
however , it had been a long-held belief that pakistani units had been killing unarmed detainees and their civilian supporters in revenge for attacks on army bases and police stations .
the unwillingness to hand over prisoners to ineffective and corrupt civilian courts has also been cited as a reason for alleged battlefield abuses .
pakistan 's focus on the swat valley and south waziristan has been honed through intense us pressure to deal with insurgents launching attacks on us and nato forces in neighboring afghanistan .
the counterinsurgency missions , which have included the targeting of taliban and their sympathizers in the general population , have been deeply unpopular and have cost the army a great deal of public support .
" one reason why the united states is stopping aid to these units now is that the us military itself believes it is more capable of pursuing an active search for and interdiction of terrorist elements in waziristan and other northwest frontier provinces territories , " david andelman , the editor of the world policy journal , told deutsche welle .
" the pakistani government has been most reluctant to give the united states the carte blanche it clearly wants to operate in these regions , in what the us believes is an essential ' hot pursuit ' doctrine of terrorist elements fleeing western military operations in neighboring afghanistan . "
while the the unit-specific halt on assistance may be a device to force pakistan to allow more direct us influence in the tribal regions , it is unlikely that it will greatly affect pakistan 's continuing offensive against the taliban and islamist extremists or washington 's broader support , an assertion backed up by us secretary of state hillary clinton 's recent announcement that the us will provide a further $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to pakistan to cover the period from 2012 to 2016 .
arbitrary use of leahy act concerns rights campaigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia saw us support withdrawn over abuse claims pakistan becomes the most high-profile victim of the leahy amendment in over a decade .
the likes of indonesia and colombia have fallen foul of the act in the past - although some aid has been restored to both - but with the us focused on the battle for afghanistan , no other country with such strategic importance has felt the effect of leahy 's law .
but while human rights campaigners support the us decision to withhold aid from the offending pakistani units , many believe that washington should do more to prevent abuses while some accuse the united states of applying the leahy amendment arbitrarily depending on its own interests and agenda .
the us just recently announced a massive $ 67 billion rearmament contract with saudi arabia , the largest component in a combined $ 122.9 billion weapons deal with the saudis , oman , kuwait and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
rights campaigners believe that washington 's desire to bolster saudi arabia 's offensive capability in the face of the threat from iran - and boost its own ailing arms industry in the process - far outweighs any concerns the us may have over the kingdom 's human rights record .
amnesty international cites torture , internment without trial , summary execution and degradation of women among saudi arabia 's long list of human rights abuses .
oman , the uae and , to a lesser extent , kuwait are also accused of similar violations .
the united states also continues to sell weapons to israel , whose armed forces are regularly accused of breaching the laws of war and ignoring humanitarian rights .
israel recently sealed a deal to purchase 20 brand-new f-35 joint strike fighter jets made by lockheed martin in a contract that , at $ 2.75 billion , is one of the largest arms purchases ever made by the state .
lack of transparency masking processes related to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian units fighting drug cartels are backed by the us " there have been a number of such instances where the us has turned a blind eye to abuses by foreign armies it supports , " said david andelman .
" the colombian military and its pursuit of narco-gangs and traffickers come immediately to mind .
certainly there have also been a number of instances in iraq and afghanistan . " " in the case of colombia , the justification is that it was difficult to identify specific units involved in the abuse and that the colombian military was essential in the efforts to interdict drug production and trafficking in the country , " he added . robert brigham , professor of history and international relations at vassar college in new york , concurs that the determination of abusive units remains a huge problem . " if one unit is found guilty of human rights abuses , but it trains and has integrated operations with another unit that has not been found guilty , the aid continues , " he told deutsche welle .
" also , there is nothing to stop private contractors from dealing with units that have been labelled as tainted under the leahy law and this remains a huge problem . "
hrw 's maria mcfarland explained that a lack of transparency in the us often clouds the processes and decisions taken by government departments responsible for approving or denying military aid .
" to justify decisions to continue funding abusive units , us officials often argue that the leahy law and other human rights conditions are in fact satisfied for various reasons , " she said .
" with regard to some streams of assistance , managed by the defense department , the law allows an exception for ' extraordinary circumstances . '
however , the process by which the departments of state and defense vet units for us aid is not very transparent , and it is often not clear whether the defense department decided to apply an exception , or on what basis there was a decision to continue funding units against which there are serious allegations .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .
leverkusen beat struggling schalke 1-0 on saturday .

" the ideals that i once honored have been lost and i have come to realize that they are morally bankrupt , " walters said in what he called a " review document " written from the maximum-security prison in vught .
it was published recently in the dutch daily de volkskrant .
walters is a leading member of the jihadist hofstadgroep , made up of islamists primarily of moroccan origin .
the group was led by mohammed bouyeri , who is serving a life sentence for killing controversial dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in 2004 .
observers said walters ' letter offered a window into the mind of a man who had dedicated his life to propagating militant islam through violence .
it helped to understand why some adopt terrorism and what prompts them to reconsider .
walters ' review could also inform the increasingly partisan immigration debate in germany and other european nations about how to prevent the radicalization of immigrant youth and help them become functioning members of society .
a different denunciation walters was accused of plotting to kill controversial dutch parliamentarians geert wilders and ayaan hirsi ali .
he resisted his arrest in 2004 in a 14-hour siege during which he threw a grenade at police , injuring four policemen .
he has now served four years of his 15-year sentence .
born in the netherlands to an african-american soldier and a dutch mother , walters converted to islam at age 16 after the divorce of his parents and his father 's subsequent conversion .
in 2003 , he made his way to pakistan for training with jihadist groups .
he boasted on his return to the netherlands that he could " disassemble a kalashnikov blindfolded and put it back together again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali-born ayaan hirsi ali wrote the script for van gogh 's film " submission " walters ' denunciation is more political and philosophical than that of other jihadist ideologues which employed islamic theology to explain their change of heart , such as the libyan islamic fighting group -lrb- lifg -rrb- or sayyid imam al-sharif , one of the early associates of ayman al-zawahiri , al-qaeda 's second-in-command .
walters , on the other hand , takes issue in his letter with the basic tenant of his former worldview .
" the image that the world only exists of believers and infidels , in which the latter are motivated only to destroy the former , is a childish and coarse simplification of reality , " walters said .
" it ignores the complexity and many nuances of which reality is rich . "
analysts and counter-terrorism authorities say walters ' letter is likely to spark debate in militant islamist circles and serve as an important tool in efforts to counter jihadists in europe .
in a statement , the dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism -lrb- nctb -rrb- described it as " a remarkable document " not seen before in the netherlands .
dutch terrorism analyst edwin bakker from the netherlands institute of international relations clingendael said the letter would serve as " a good tool in the ideological fight against terrorists and islamists . "
a sincere document walters ' lawyer , bart nooitgedagt , rejected allegations that his client had written the letter in an effort to influence his appeal hearing .
an amsterdam court is set to determine whether the throwing of the grenade was a criminal or a terrorist act and whether the hofstadgroep was a terrorist organization .
the appeals court had ordered new proceedings in response to objections by the public prosecutor to the initial conviction of walters and his associates on criminal charges only .

analysts and counter-terrorism authorities say walters ' letter is likely to spark debate in militant islamist circles and serve as an important tool in efforts to counter jihadists in europe .
in a statement , the dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism -lrb- nctb -rrb- described it as " a remarkable document " not seen before in the netherlands .

an amsterdam court is set to determine whether the throwing of the grenade was a criminal or a terrorist act and whether the hofstadgroep was a terrorist organization .

" the ideals that i once honored have been lost and i have come to realize that they are morally bankrupt , " walters said in what he called a " review document " written from the maximum-security prison in vught .
it was published recently in the dutch daily de volkskrant .
walters is a leading member of the jihadist hofstadgroep , made up of islamists primarily of moroccan origin .
the group was led by mohammed bouyeri , who is serving a life sentence for killing controversial dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in 2004 .
observers said walters ' letter offered a window into the mind of a man who had dedicated his life to propagating militant islam through violence .
it helped to understand why some adopt terrorism and what prompts them to reconsider .
walters ' review could also inform the increasingly partisan immigration debate in germany and other european nations about how to prevent the radicalization of immigrant youth and help them become functioning members of society .
a different denunciation walters was accused of plotting to kill controversial dutch parliamentarians geert wilders and ayaan hirsi ali .
he resisted his arrest in 2004 in a 14-hour siege during which he threw a grenade at police , injuring four policemen .
he has now served four years of his 15-year sentence .
born in the netherlands to an african-american soldier and a dutch mother , walters converted to islam at age 16 after the divorce of his parents and his father 's subsequent conversion .
in 2003 , he made his way to pakistan for training with jihadist groups .
he boasted on his return to the netherlands that he could " disassemble a kalashnikov blindfolded and put it back together again . "

dutch terrorism analyst edwin bakker from the netherlands institute of international relations clingendael said the letter would serve as " a good tool in the ideological fight against terrorists and islamists . "
a sincere document walters ' lawyer , bart nooitgedagt , rejected allegations that his client had written the letter in an effort to influence his appeal hearing .
an amsterdam court is set to determine whether the throwing of the grenade was a criminal or a terrorist act and whether the hofstadgroep was a terrorist organization .
the appeals court had ordered new proceedings in response to objections by the public prosecutor to the initial conviction of walters and his associates on criminal charges only .
of the seven defendants in the original case , walters is the only one still incarcerated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walters realized that violence is not the path to take in islam nooitgedagt said walters had written his letter some time ago , even though he only published it last week .
" jason anticipated the criticism , but assertions that the letter was inspired by dishonest motives are incorrect , " nooitgedagt said .
" the content of the letter is too fundamental for that . "
walters initially signaled his change of heart during the appeals court hearing in july , where he was the only defendant to appear in court in person .
" i was passive and uncooperative in the -lrb- lower -rrb- court in the hague , " walters told the court in a reference to his earlier rejection of the dutch justice system .
" but now i will actively defend myself .
i have confidence in the competence and the integrity of this court and in the dutch system . "

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .
not only did sigurdsson 's shot take a wicked deflection , but hoffenheim were fortunate play was n't stopped when striker demba ba appeared to handle the ball in the build up .
in the second half , the floodgates opened .
sigurdsson added his second from the penalty spot three minutes after the restart , then demba ba got on the scoresheet three minutes after that , and german teenager peniel mlapa put the result beyond any doubt with about twenty minutes remaining .
" we made our lives rather difficult in the first half , playing too many wayward passes , " hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said after the game .
" after the break we improved , and settled the match . "
attack-minded hoffenheim 's strong goal difference means they now occupy third place in the league , though they 're equal with fourth-place bayer leverkusen on eighteen points .

the democrats are predicted to lose their majority in the house . three days before the congressional election in the united states , president barack obama was working to avert the predicted loss of votes for his democrats .
at campaign events on saturday , he attempted to mobilize disappointed supporters to vote on november 2 . obama acknowledges difficulties because many americans are dissatisfied with the policies of the government , the democrats could face a massive loss of seats in the senate and house of representatives in the upcoming ballot .
disappointed voters accuse obama of failing to keep the campaign promises he made two years ago .
after appearances in pennsylvania and connecticut , obama told thousands of supporters in his hometown of chicago , illinois , that the election would be difficult .
he urged the crowd not to be discouraged in the struggle for reform .
" i want everybody here to understand - do n't let anybody tell you that this fight has n't been worth it , " he implored the audience of about 35,000 .
the rally in hyde park was his first public appearance in chicago since the victory celebration following the 2008 presidential election .
fun on the mall in washington , meanwhile , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against a political polarization in the country .
supporters gathered at washington 's national mall for the ' rally to restore sanity ' , hosted by the prominent television satirists jon stewart and stephen colbert .
the festive atmosphere around the capitol was heightened as many people attend in halloween costumes , holding signs poking fun at conservatives who accuse president barack obama of pursuing a socialist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters disrupted obama 's get-out-the-vote rally stewart and colbert each host mock news programs on tv channel comedy central , where they deliver the day 's events with biting wit .
politically , they are close to the democrats .
the initiative is a response to an august rally hosted by ultra-conservative fox news host glenn beck .
at least 80,000 supporters of the " tea party " movement followed beck 's call to demonstrate in support of " restoring honor " against the " socialist " policies of obama 's government .
poisoning the political climate stewart and colbert accuse the " tea party " of poisoning the political climate with polemical attacks on obama .
the movement routinely labels the us president a communist .
the " tea party " has criticized obama 's health care reforms and tightened control of financial markets as unfair state intervention in individual freedom .
the democrats have a reason to fear that on 2 november , they 'll lose their majority in the house of representatives .
according to polls , republicans stand to gain even more than the 39 seats they need to control that chamber .
in the senate , the race is closer .
there , the republicans would need to gain 10 seats to secure the coveted majority .

the party 's leader hit back at accusations of extremism . the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- voted to take a tough stance against immigrants who fail to integrate into german society at a party conference in munich on saturday .
included in a new seven-point plan were proposals for " unspecified sanctions for parents who hinder their children from integrating into the german way of life or who themselves decline to integrate by learning german . "
the plan , which stipulates that permanent residents must accept a " leading " role for german culture in society , was approved unanimously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party says parents who hinder childrens ' integration should face sanctions also contained were proposals to tackle skills shortages by training existing immigrants , who would also be required to learn better german , rather than allowing new migrants to enter the country .
in its policy , the csu - sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats - said that skills shortages should not be considered " carte blanche " for unrestricted immigration .
however , the document did contain provision to ease restrictions on offering long-term residency to immigrants earning high salaries . leading role for german culture speaking at the conference , party leader horst seehofer denied claims that he was pandering to the extreme right following controversy over his call for an end to immigration from alien cultures - in particular from islamic countries .
" if what i say is radically right wing , then two-thirds of the population is radically right wing , " seehofer said .
" we should not be timid about saying that we stand for german culture taking a leading role . "
german values were " based on christianity and rooted in judaism , " seehofer added .
" they are not informed by islam and that must remain the case . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel told the conference on friday that multiculturalism had failed the policy vote came as chancellor merkel said that more people of an immigrant origin should be employed in the public sector .
" people of migrant origin are under-represented in government services , " merkel said in a video message posted on the chancellery website on saturday .
" this has to change . "
but those comments came one day after the chancellor reiterated her opinion , stated several weeks ago , that multiculturalism in germany had failed .
the comments are the latest in a national debate in germany about a perceived failure of the country 's turkish and arab community to integrate .
question of leadership the new policy was drafted by the leadership of the csu , considered the most conservative of germany 's mainstream parties .
another talking point of the conference was the growing popularity of the party 's rising star - defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg – which drew a barbed comment from seehofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg is seen as a likely successor to seehofer " germany does n't just consist of karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
neither does the csu , " said seehofer , 61 .
many see the younger , popular guttenberg as his likely successor .
during the two-day event the csu also abandoned its long-standing support for military conscription and voted in favor of restructuring the armed forces .
the party also voted to introduce a quota that would require that 40 percent of the high-level positions in the party be filled by women .

their status here is in limbo , as they are stuck between residency and deportation .
a program in essen is helping some non-residents improve their lot . at the residency through work office in essen , aref ekinci has more bad news for his advisor .
the foreigners ' registration office has denied him a residency permit once again .
instead , he 's got a new duldung , or a conditional residency permit .
the name literally means " toleration , " and is a temporary measure that more or less states that while a person 's presence is tolerated , there has been no final decision on permanent residency or deportation .
ekinci has had such a permit for the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program pairs immigrants to work options the story of aref ekinci is typical of the 88,000 people whose residency in germany is not officially recognized .
ekinci , the son of a turkish guest worker , was born and raised in germany .
he went to school here and speaks perfect german .
in the 1990s , ekinci moved back to turkey and worked in the tourism industry .
but when he wanted to return to his family in essen five years ago , ekinci was not granted a residence permit from the foreign office .
" of course , the foreigners ' registration office always says ' we 'll see what we can do , " ' ekinci said .
" but you come back in three months and they 're still looking . "
ekinci is slowly getting the feeling that it could take quite a while .
" you 're here , " he said , " but somehow you actually are n't here in germany . "
a better chance it 's for people like ekinci , who have no secure status as a resident and face the possibility of deportation every day , that the residency through work program was created .
the program was initiated in february , 2009 by the youth welfare service and the church-run social welfare program in essen for youths and adults with a conditional residency permit who still have a chance at permanent residency in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internships often lead to jobs a conditional permit has implications for work and everyday life .
it does n't necessarily make a good impression on an employer , who may worry that the worker could be suddenly deported .
and , a conditional permit limits a person 's ability to move .
in the state of north-rhine westphalia , ekinci is n't allowed to leave the state or travel .
" you 're at an overall disadvantage , " ekinci said .
people from many countries take part in the program , including serbia , bosnia , turkey , syria , iran , iraq and afghanistan .
some have been living in germany for 20 or 25 years , and others were even born here .
" our goal is to increase the chances of permanent residency through work and education , " said ina wolbeck , head of the project .
defeating the ‘ duldung ’ thirty participants take part in the program at the same time .
twice a week they take classes at aimed at improving their german as a working language , as well as math and politics .
they also work on data processing .
in the remaining three days of the week , they work at an internship or on a trial basis in a company of their choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lessons are part of the program taking part in the program makes that possible .
when employers know that the workers are there with the support of the program , then the fact that they are in germany with a conditional permit is not as much of a deterrent .
and , when participants are given the chance to show what they are capable of , an apprenticeship or a job is n't out of the question .
the project leaders work closely with the foreigners ' registration office in essen . it must approve every participant , and every two months , representatives from the office meet with residency through work team members and review the progress of each participant in the program .
" we try to see what we can do in each individual case to get the residency granted , " said wolbeck .
not about the numbers the program does n't have a fixed time frame ; participants stop coming when they find an apprenticeship or a job .
so far , of 67 participants who have done the program , a third were able to find a job or an apprenticeship .
but the numbers are n't the most important part of the program , says ekinci .
since starting the program , he 's found a part-time job and is hoping for a full-time position with a corporate security department .
" if i had just been sitting at home , i do n't think i would have had the confidence to send out the application , " he said .
but now , thanks to the residency through work program , he 's back on the job market .
" it gave me my self-confidence back , " he said .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .
" i think this was a victory for portugal and for the portuguese because it was shown that understanding is possible on the essential questions that have a bearing on our future , " eduardo catroga , the psd negotiator , told reporters .
" it was very important to tell the country that we could agree . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister socrates threatened to quit if the budget were not passed the agreement reaffirms the goal of reaching a public deficit of 4.6 percent of gdp by the end of 2011 , in contrast to the 7.3 percent expected for this year .
" we have met the conditions for adopting a budget that will entail sacrifices from the portuguese in order to insure the financing of the country , " finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said .
under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .
however , the psd were successful in having some product categories exempted .
because the government has no majority , it will need the support of the opposition - or at least an agreement to abstain from voting - to pass the budget legislation .
prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .
talks resumed after warning the sides halted talks on wednesday , but resumed them on friday after warnings from portuguese president anibal cavaco silva .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failure to agree could have forced portugal to ask for a financial bailout , like greece " the current financial situation of the country is very serious and can not cope with attitudes that will lead to the start of a political crisis , " silva said .
failure to reach an agreement could have forced the government to seek a financial bailout from its european partners , as greece did earlier this year .
unions have responded to the planned austerity measures with a call for a general strike on november 24 .

" this is a joint action with the united states , great britain , and france . "
airlines , freight forwarders and couriers have been ordered to closely examine every consignment originating from yemen which either arrives despite the ban or which is already being held in storage en route to its destination .
germany 's postal service , deutsche post - which is also the parent of germany 's global courier giant dhl - said it was already running special checks on all incoming parcels from yemen .
yemen police on sunday released a university student arrested the day before on suspicion of having links to the two parcels containing explosives found on us-bound flights .
one package was intercepted at britain 's east midlands airport , and another at a freight center in dubai .
they were bound for two synagogues in chicago .
mid east visit postponed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister is needed closer to home for now the german interior minister has also called off his planned trip to the middle east for the time being .
de maiziere had been scheduled to attend a conference on homeland security in tel aviv , hold talks with israeli investors , and discuss the ground-breaking prospect of four new , german-financed police stations in the west bank city of ramallah .
" our security boss needs to stay at the helm , " a spokesman for the interior ministry told reporters , saying that the continuing investigation into the bomb plot would force the interior minister to stay on german soil .
" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .
speaking in dresden , de maiziere said german authorities received the tip between late thursday and early friday that explosives were inside a us-bound parcel .
germany 's federal crime office , the bka , then discovered the package 's consignment number and notified the british authorities .
bombs touched down in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities were too late to nab the explosives in germany the intelligence came in too late , however , to intercept the explosives while they were on german soil .
authorities confirmed on saturday that the package went through cologne / bonn airport en route to east midlands airport , north of london .
by the time the authorities had identified the offending package , they were too late to stop it taking off from the western german airport .
" it was already on the way to britain , " a bka spokeswoman said .
" we managed to inform our partners in london so that they were able to look specifically for the package and find it . "
" we are taking this situation very seriously , even though it seems that germany was not the target of the attack , " interior minister thomas de maiziere said of the incident , announcing an investigation into whether there are gaps in the policing of air freight security .
an alleged bombmaker from saudi arabia emerged as the key suspect behind the parcel bombs , a us official said on sunday . author : mark hallam -lrb- apn , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the democrats are predicted to lose their majority in the house . three days before the congressional election in the united states , president barack obama was working to avert the predicted loss of votes for his democrats .
at campaign events on saturday , he attempted to mobilize disappointed supporters to vote on november 2 . obama acknowledges difficulties because many americans are dissatisfied with the policies of the government , the democrats could face a massive loss of seats in the senate and house of representatives in the upcoming ballot .
disappointed voters accuse obama of failing to keep the campaign promises he made two years ago .
after appearances in pennsylvania and connecticut , obama told thousands of supporters in his hometown of chicago , illinois , that the election would be difficult .
he urged the crowd not to be discouraged in the struggle for reform .
" i want everybody here to understand - do n't let anybody tell you that this fight has n't been worth it , " he implored the audience of about 35,000 .
the rally in hyde park was his first public appearance in chicago since the victory celebration following the 2008 presidential election .
fun on the mall in washington , meanwhile , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against a political polarization in the country .
supporters gathered at washington 's national mall for the ' rally to restore sanity ' , hosted by the prominent television satirists jon stewart and stephen colbert .
the festive atmosphere around the capitol was heightened as many people attend in halloween costumes , holding signs poking fun at conservatives who accuse president barack obama of pursuing a socialist agenda .

politically , they are close to the democrats .
the initiative is a response to an august rally hosted by ultra-conservative fox news host glenn beck .
at least 80,000 supporters of the " tea party " movement followed beck 's call to demonstrate in support of " restoring honor " against the " socialist " policies of obama 's government .
poisoning the political climate stewart and colbert accuse the " tea party " of poisoning the political climate with polemical attacks on obama .
the movement routinely labels the us president a communist .
the " tea party " has criticized obama 's health care reforms and tightened control of financial markets as unfair state intervention in individual freedom .
the democrats have a reason to fear that on 2 november , they 'll lose their majority in the house of representatives .
according to polls , republicans stand to gain even more than the 39 seats they need to control that chamber .
in the senate , the race is closer .
there , the republicans would need to gain 10 seats to secure the coveted majority .

the party 's leader hit back at accusations of extremism . the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- voted to take a tough stance against immigrants who fail to integrate into german society at a party conference in munich on saturday .
included in a new seven-point plan were proposals for " unspecified sanctions for parents who hinder their children from integrating into the german way of life or who themselves decline to integrate by learning german . "
the plan , which stipulates that permanent residents must accept a " leading " role for german culture in society , was approved unanimously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party says parents who hinder childrens ' integration should face sanctions also contained were proposals to tackle skills shortages by training existing immigrants , who would also be required to learn better german , rather than allowing new migrants to enter the country .
in its policy , the csu - sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats - said that skills shortages should not be considered " carte blanche " for unrestricted immigration .
however , the document did contain provision to ease restrictions on offering long-term residency to immigrants earning high salaries . leading role for german culture speaking at the conference , party leader horst seehofer denied claims that he was pandering to the extreme right following controversy over his call for an end to immigration from alien cultures - in particular from islamic countries .
" if what i say is radically right wing , then two-thirds of the population is radically right wing , " seehofer said .
" we should not be timid about saying that we stand for german culture taking a leading role . "
german values were " based on christianity and rooted in judaism , " seehofer added .
" they are not informed by islam and that must remain the case . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel told the conference on friday that multiculturalism had failed the policy vote came as chancellor merkel said that more people of an immigrant origin should be employed in the public sector .
" people of migrant origin are under-represented in government services , " merkel said in a video message posted on the chancellery website on saturday .
" this has to change . "
but those comments came one day after the chancellor reiterated her opinion , stated several weeks ago , that multiculturalism in germany had failed .
the comments are the latest in a national debate in germany about a perceived failure of the country 's turkish and arab community to integrate .
question of leadership the new policy was drafted by the leadership of the csu , considered the most conservative of germany 's mainstream parties .
another talking point of the conference was the growing popularity of the party 's rising star - defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg – which drew a barbed comment from seehofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg is seen as a likely successor to seehofer " germany does n't just consist of karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
neither does the csu , " said seehofer , 61 .
many see the younger , popular guttenberg as his likely successor .
during the two-day event the csu also abandoned its long-standing support for military conscription and voted in favor of restructuring the armed forces .
the party also voted to introduce a quota that would require that 40 percent of the high-level positions in the party be filled by women .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .

prime minister jose socrates had threatened to resign if the spending plans were not passed , raising fears that months of political uncertainty could follow .
under the country 's constitution , it would not be possible to hold a general election until may .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .

the hard-fought , but well-deserved win secured dortmund the top spot in germany 's bundesliga soccer table , and relegated mainz to second place .
prior to the season , nobody could have predicted that sunday 's matchup between minnows mainz and perennial under-achievers borussia dortmund would decide the bundesliga leader going into november .
yet the two teams are n't just topping the table , they 're six and seven points clear of the chasing pack , a situation sure to scare the league 's traditional big-hitters on halloween .
" we stuck to our game plan well against a very strong opponent , " dortmund coach juergen klopp told reporters after the match .
klopp described his young side 's five consecutive away wins - a record start to a season for any bundesliga team - as " absolutely insane , " but also insisted " we are wasting absolutely no time thinking about the championship . "
super mario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach klopp was full of praise , but still says the title 's not on his radar dortmund 's 18-year-old homegrown star mario goetze was the hero of the game , firing borussia into the lead on 26 minutes , and later setting up striker lukas barrios for the decisive second goal .
mainz started both halves strongly , and had a great chance to equalize shortly after the break , but dortmund goalie roman weidenfeller held his nerve and saved a penalty from eugen polanski .
japanese newcomer shinji kagawa nearly made it two for dortmund with a long-range drive on 64 minutes , saved by christian wetklo in the mainz goal .
three minutes later , goetze found space in midfield and delivered a great pass to lukas barrios , who skipped around wetklo and slotted home his fifth goal of the season .
" we have to admit that dortmund were clearly the better side , " mainz captain nikolce noveski said after the table-topping contest .
" we could only match them at the beginning of the game , then dormund took control . "
high-scoring hoffenheim grab third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's forwards had four chances to celebrate in sunday 's later fixture , hoffenheim secured a slightly flattering 4-0 scoreline against their resilient guests hanover , climbing to third in the table .
hanover - who have made a surprisingly strong start to the season and sit sixth in the table despite the defeat - were on the back foot for most of the game , after manuel schmiedebach was sent off for his second bookable offence in just the 18th minute .
" 11 versus 11 , it would have been a good game , " hanover coach mirko slomka lamented .
" but once we went a man down against a strong hoffenheim team , we had no chance . "
the outnumbered visitors held on until first half stoppage time , when icelandic midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson scored a rather fortunate opening goal .

on friday , authorities discovered explosives in two packages being sent from yemen to synagogues in the us . the german government announced on sunday that it had stopped all inbound freight deliveries from yemen , after parcel bombs bound for us synagogues were intercepted from two passenger planes earlier in the week .
" the german government has ordered a stop to freight to germany from yemen until further notice , " interior minister thomas de maiziere told german public radio .
" this is a joint action with the united states , great britain , and france . "
airlines , freight forwarders and couriers have been ordered to closely examine every consignment originating from yemen which either arrives despite the ban or which is already being held in storage en route to its destination .
germany 's postal service , deutsche post - which is also the parent of germany 's global courier giant dhl - said it was already running special checks on all incoming parcels from yemen .
yemen police on sunday released a university student arrested the day before on suspicion of having links to the two parcels containing explosives found on us-bound flights .
one package was intercepted at britain 's east midlands airport , and another at a freight center in dubai .
they were bound for two synagogues in chicago .
mid east visit postponed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister is needed closer to home for now the german interior minister has also called off his planned trip to the middle east for the time being .
de maiziere had been scheduled to attend a conference on homeland security in tel aviv , hold talks with israeli investors , and discuss the ground-breaking prospect of four new , german-financed police stations in the west bank city of ramallah .
" our security boss needs to stay at the helm , " a spokesman for the interior ministry told reporters , saying that the continuing investigation into the bomb plot would force the interior minister to stay on german soil .
" they have agreed to reschedule the trip to a date as soon as possible , " de maiziere 's aide continued .
the german interior minister also explained that berlin alerted great britain to the parcel bomb threat after a tip off from a " friendly intelligence agency , " widely believed to be saudi arabia .
speaking in dresden , de maiziere said german authorities received the tip between late thursday and early friday that explosives were inside a us-bound parcel .
germany 's federal crime office , the bka , then discovered the package 's consignment number and notified the british authorities .
bombs touched down in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities were too late to nab the explosives in germany the intelligence came in too late , however , to intercept the explosives while they were on german soil .
authorities confirmed on saturday that the package went through cologne / bonn airport en route to east midlands airport , north of london .
by the time the authorities had identified the offending package , they were too late to stop it taking off from the western german airport .
" it was already on the way to britain , " a bka spokeswoman said .
" we managed to inform our partners in london so that they were able to look specifically for the package and find it . "
" we are taking this situation very seriously , even though it seems that germany was not the target of the attack , " interior minister thomas de maiziere said of the incident , announcing an investigation into whether there are gaps in the policing of air freight security .
an alleged bombmaker from saudi arabia emerged as the key suspect behind the parcel bombs , a us official said on sunday . author : mark hallam -lrb- apn , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the democrats are predicted to lose their majority in the house . three days before the congressional election in the united states , president barack obama was working to avert the predicted loss of votes for his democrats .
at campaign events on saturday , he attempted to mobilize disappointed supporters to vote on november 2 . obama acknowledges difficulties because many americans are dissatisfied with the policies of the government , the democrats could face a massive loss of seats in the senate and house of representatives in the upcoming ballot .
disappointed voters accuse obama of failing to keep the campaign promises he made two years ago .
after appearances in pennsylvania and connecticut , obama told thousands of supporters in his hometown of chicago , illinois , that the election would be difficult .
he urged the crowd not to be discouraged in the struggle for reform .
" i want everybody here to understand - do n't let anybody tell you that this fight has n't been worth it , " he implored the audience of about 35,000 .
the rally in hyde park was his first public appearance in chicago since the victory celebration following the 2008 presidential election .
fun on the mall in washington , meanwhile , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against a political polarization in the country .
supporters gathered at washington 's national mall for the ' rally to restore sanity ' , hosted by the prominent television satirists jon stewart and stephen colbert .
the festive atmosphere around the capitol was heightened as many people attend in halloween costumes , holding signs poking fun at conservatives who accuse president barack obama of pursuing a socialist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters disrupted obama 's get-out-the-vote rally stewart and colbert each host mock news programs on tv channel comedy central , where they deliver the day 's events with biting wit .
politically , they are close to the democrats .
the initiative is a response to an august rally hosted by ultra-conservative fox news host glenn beck .
at least 80,000 supporters of the " tea party " movement followed beck 's call to demonstrate in support of " restoring honor " against the " socialist " policies of obama 's government .
poisoning the political climate stewart and colbert accuse the " tea party " of poisoning the political climate with polemical attacks on obama .
the movement routinely labels the us president a communist .
the " tea party " has criticized obama 's health care reforms and tightened control of financial markets as unfair state intervention in individual freedom .
the democrats have a reason to fear that on 2 november , they 'll lose their majority in the house of representatives .
according to polls , republicans stand to gain even more than the 39 seats they need to control that chamber .
in the senate , the race is closer .
there , the republicans would need to gain 10 seats to secure the coveted majority .

the party 's leader hit back at accusations of extremism . the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- voted to take a tough stance against immigrants who fail to integrate into german society at a party conference in munich on saturday .
included in a new seven-point plan were proposals for " unspecified sanctions for parents who hinder their children from integrating into the german way of life or who themselves decline to integrate by learning german . "
the plan , which stipulates that permanent residents must accept a " leading " role for german culture in society , was approved unanimously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party says parents who hinder childrens ' integration should face sanctions also contained were proposals to tackle skills shortages by training existing immigrants , who would also be required to learn better german , rather than allowing new migrants to enter the country .
in its policy , the csu - sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats - said that skills shortages should not be considered " carte blanche " for unrestricted immigration .
however , the document did contain provision to ease restrictions on offering long-term residency to immigrants earning high salaries . leading role for german culture speaking at the conference , party leader horst seehofer denied claims that he was pandering to the extreme right following controversy over his call for an end to immigration from alien cultures - in particular from islamic countries .
" if what i say is radically right wing , then two-thirds of the population is radically right wing , " seehofer said .
" we should not be timid about saying that we stand for german culture taking a leading role . "
german values were " based on christianity and rooted in judaism , " seehofer added .
" they are not informed by islam and that must remain the case . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel told the conference on friday that multiculturalism had failed the policy vote came as chancellor merkel said that more people of an immigrant origin should be employed in the public sector .
" people of migrant origin are under-represented in government services , " merkel said in a video message posted on the chancellery website on saturday .
" this has to change . "
but those comments came one day after the chancellor reiterated her opinion , stated several weeks ago , that multiculturalism in germany had failed .
the comments are the latest in a national debate in germany about a perceived failure of the country 's turkish and arab community to integrate .
question of leadership the new policy was drafted by the leadership of the csu , considered the most conservative of germany 's mainstream parties .
another talking point of the conference was the growing popularity of the party 's rising star - defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg – which drew a barbed comment from seehofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg is seen as a likely successor to seehofer " germany does n't just consist of karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
neither does the csu , " said seehofer , 61 .
many see the younger , popular guttenberg as his likely successor .
during the two-day event the csu also abandoned its long-standing support for military conscription and voted in favor of restructuring the armed forces .
the party also voted to introduce a quota that would require that 40 percent of the high-level positions in the party be filled by women .

the agreement is seen as crucial step in averting political and financial chaos . the minority socialist government of portugal struck a deal late on friday to allow a crucial austerity budget to be passed for next year , reducing the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product .
the government made a number of concessions to the center-right social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , who had called for a reduction in public spending rather than an increase in taxes .
the agreement follows a lengthy stand off between the two sides , and follows warnings of a political crisis affecting the country 's financial future .

under the deal , the socialists have kept an increase in the vat value-added tax , a kind of sales tax , from 21 percent to 23 percent on most products .

the democrats are predicted to lose their majority in the house . three days before the congressional election in the united states , president barack obama was working to avert the predicted loss of votes for his democrats .
at campaign events on saturday , he attempted to mobilize disappointed supporters to vote on november 2 . obama acknowledges difficulties because many americans are dissatisfied with the policies of the government , the democrats could face a massive loss of seats in the senate and house of representatives in the upcoming ballot .
disappointed voters accuse obama of failing to keep the campaign promises he made two years ago .
after appearances in pennsylvania and connecticut , obama told thousands of supporters in his hometown of chicago , illinois , that the election would be difficult .
he urged the crowd not to be discouraged in the struggle for reform .
" i want everybody here to understand - do n't let anybody tell you that this fight has n't been worth it , " he implored the audience of about 35,000 .
the rally in hyde park was his first public appearance in chicago since the victory celebration following the 2008 presidential election .
fun on the mall in washington , meanwhile , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against a political polarization in the country .
supporters gathered at washington 's national mall for the ' rally to restore sanity ' , hosted by the prominent television satirists jon stewart and stephen colbert .
the festive atmosphere around the capitol was heightened as many people attend in halloween costumes , holding signs poking fun at conservatives who accuse president barack obama of pursuing a socialist agenda .

at least 80,000 supporters of the " tea party " movement followed beck 's call to demonstrate in support of " restoring honor " against the " socialist " policies of obama 's government .
poisoning the political climate stewart and colbert accuse the " tea party " of poisoning the political climate with polemical attacks on obama .
the movement routinely labels the us president a communist .
the " tea party " has criticized obama 's health care reforms and tightened control of financial markets as unfair state intervention in individual freedom .
the democrats have a reason to fear that on 2 november , they 'll lose their majority in the house of representatives .
according to polls , republicans stand to gain even more than the 39 seats they need to control that chamber .
in the senate , the race is closer .
there , the republicans would need to gain 10 seats to secure the coveted majority .
