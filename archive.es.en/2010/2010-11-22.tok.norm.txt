this " city of three rivers " became an important center of trade .
while the fire that destroyed the city in 1662 was tragic , it was the impetus for a stunning baroque reconstruction that continues to serve as a magnet for tourists today .
passau 's many churches and abbeys - there are about 50 of them in the city - give it a special charm .
the diocese of passau once extended all the way to present-day hungary .
a stroll through the streets of the old town is akin to walking through an open-air museum .
but new life pulses behind these baroque facades : today , passau is a hub of art and culture .
the hoellgasse alleyway is now home to a number of artisans , painters , galleries and artists ' studios .
the museum of modern art was at the forefront of the city 's cultural awakening .
it was opened 20 years ago in one of passau 's most beautiful historic buildings .
passau 's old quarter is defined by an abundance of cafes and taverns .
guests can choose from hearty fare to smaller delicacies .
cafe simon creates famous pralines , in shapes that are reminiscent of the ornate golden hats once worn by passau 's wealthy female residents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.11.2010 eu agrees bailout for ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland has admitted it needs financial help eu finance ministers have agreed on a bailout fund for ireland to tackle the country 's huge budget deficit and save its banking sector .
it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .
the euro had faced heavy selling recently due to concerns over ireland 's debts ' impact on the economic bloc .

the allocation scam is thought to have cost the government over us $ 35 billion . former telecoms minister a. raja , who was forced to resign earlier this month , is alleged to have issued 2g licenses in january 2008 at prices well below market value .
these frequencies are used to transmit phone calls and text messages to mobile phones . " mr clean 's " reputation at risk the controversy has now engulfed prime minister manmohan singh , whose reputation as " mr clean " is at risk , with the supreme court asking him to explain why mr raja has still not been prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the organizers of the commonwealth games in delhi have been arrested " the role of the prime minister is in question , " explained gurudas dasgupta , an mp from the communist party of india , recalling a similar scandal involving an indian stockbroker who is alleged to have engineered a rise in the bombay stock exchange . " in 1991 when the harshad mehta scam came to light , i raised the matter in the rajya sabha -lrb- upper house of parliament -rrb- , " he says .
" our fingers were raised against the finance ministry .
at that time , the finance minister was manmohan singh .
he agreed to a joint parliamentary committee -lrb- jpc -rrb- , even when his role was being questioned .
today , his role as pm is being questioned . " the telecom scam is just one of the current scandals to haunt the government .
the ruling congress was recently forced to sack ashok chavan , chief minister of the important state of maharashtra , after he and other politicians were found to have colluded to obtain luxury flats that were destined for war widows . before that the government had launched a multiple-agency probe into the commonwealth games after fingers were pointed at the chief organizer suresh kalmadi .
two of his aides have already been arrested by anti-corruption investigators . " if you are not part of the oligarchy , you are out " however , the ruling party is not alone to be embroiled in scandal .
the major opposition bharatiya janata party also faces charges , particularly in the southern state of karnataka , whose chief minister , b s yedyurappa , is currently entangled in a land scam . " corruption has made people prosperous through the shorter route , " deplored kiran bedi , one of india ’ s most-celebrated women police officers and a vocal campaigner against corruption . " there is now a cozy relationship between bureaucrats , corporations and politicians – an oligarchic capitalism of corruption .
if you are not part of this oligarchy , you are out of the system , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian communications and information technology minister a. raja was forced to resign earlier this month prime minister has to show " vision " according to transparency international 's corruption perceptions index for 2010 , india has slipped three places to 87 out of 178 this year . though the scandals pose no immediate threat to singh 's government , they are likely to delay the passage of more reform bills . " this is going to continue because the opportunities in india are going to increase , " warned analyst samar harlankar . " in the last 20 years , the receipts to government have grown by more than 10 .
our economy is going to grow and the opportunities are always going to be there .
so this has to be struck at and punishment has to be shown .
the prime minister himself has to get involved .
he has to show vision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .

this " city of three rivers " became an important center of trade .
while the fire that destroyed the city in 1662 was tragic , it was the impetus for a stunning baroque reconstruction that continues to serve as a magnet for tourists today .
passau 's many churches and abbeys - there are about 50 of them in the city - give it a special charm .
the diocese of passau once extended all the way to present-day hungary .
a stroll through the streets of the old town is akin to walking through an open-air museum .
but new life pulses behind these baroque facades : today , passau is a hub of art and culture .
the hoellgasse alleyway is now home to a number of artisans , painters , galleries and artists ' studios .
the museum of modern art was at the forefront of the city 's cultural awakening .
it was opened 20 years ago in one of passau 's most beautiful historic buildings .
passau 's old quarter is defined by an abundance of cafes and taverns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .
the sooner australia becomes a republic and finally shakes the shackles of great britain the better for all .
viva la republique de australie .
i dream of a new day i do . - stuart , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal the german media and public are as nearly as fascinated with the wedding of prince william and kate middleton as the british press is - almost surprisingly so for a european country with no royal court of its own .

he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .

the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.11.2010 eu agrees bailout for ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland has admitted it needs financial help eu finance ministers have agreed on a bailout fund for ireland to tackle the country 's huge budget deficit and save its banking sector .
it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 22.11.2010 deutsche bank goes to vegas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money , money , money makes vegas go round come mid-december , las vegas will be one casino richer and the deutsche bank will have officially planted a large and very expensive foot in the nevada desert .
but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

he contemplates on how the pilgrimage to mecca has changed his picture of saudi arabia - and talks about his conversations with foreign workers in the country . i 'm sitting among hundreds of thousands of exhausted pilgrims at jeddah airport and i know : it 's all over now .
goodbye to mecca !
thanks for having me .
and i also want to thank all the dw users who cast a critical eye on my journey and posted numerous questions .
your feedback has been a real incitement to my work - and it 's been a lot of fun .
i 'm proud that i was able to reach muslims as well as non-muslims with my diary entries .
by the way , not all of the pilgrims are going home now .
some go on to spend a vacation here , if they can afford it .
many of them stroll along the beaches of the red sea with dark sunglasses .
the hotels are still booked-out .
however , i 'm sitting here at the airport among the many other " flying pilgrims . "
in fact , the rush of people is so heavy that we were asked to be here six hours before departure time .
ex-pilgrims with sunglasses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims at a hotel in jeddah prior to my journey to mecca , i had n't personally met a saudi in my whole life .
i was only familiar with the common prejudices that other arabs like to tell each other about saudis - particularly in yemen , the extremely poor country i come from .
from a yemeni perspective , they easily seem like spoiled " brothers " from a rich neighboring country .
and while saudi arabia has close ties with western countries , it also applies a particularly conservative islamic rule - including whippings and death penalties for violations of the sharia .
my visit was too short to question or change this picture fundamentally .
however , i made some diverging observations that might help to better differentiate between the country 's people and the existing system of government .
all of the saudis that i met in the past days were very friendly - and they were open-minded as well .
let 's take the young men working for the hajj 's organizing committee : all of them had been to college , many of them in foreign countries .
and they all spoke at least three foreign languages .
they love to have fun a lot and spice up their working days with jokes .
at the same time , they 're proud muslims who are very sensitive about utterances associating islam directly or indirectly with extremism or terrorism .
" we utterly reject that , " they say .
" we 're tolerant and open-minded toward non-muslims as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating with multilingual saudi employees of the pilgrim 's office i personally had the feeling that they really meant what they said , and that they were n't just saying it to me because i 'm a journalist from a foreign media company .
however , what about the government 's policies ?
there are a number of facts that can hardly be conveyed to a foreign audience , such as the ban of christian symbols or the exclusion of women from the general public .
what is more , foreigners coming into the country need a saudi resident acting as a guarantor for them .
muhammad is fluent in korean muhammad works for the pilgrimage 's information office as well .
he studied in south korea for five years , where he lived only among locals - he 's fluent in the language .
he still raves about the time in the far east : " koreans are very kind and caring people .
they virtually love foreigners . "
i get the feeling that muhammad was really well-integrated over there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of jiddah these are the moments when you 're sitting in mecca and you 're suddenly reminded of the integration debate going on in germany .
i ask myself : is language really that important when it comes to integration ?
i wonder about that ever since i met bikhiit , a plumber who was hired by a saudi prince only for the days of the hajj .
bikhiit worked on the prince 's luxurious pilgrim 's tent in mecca .
the prince and the plumber bikhiit is from egypt .
aside from his different accent , he 's probably as good in arabic as the saudi prince .
every year , he makes sure that the prince 's pilgrim 's tent is provided with constant warm water .
the sanitary engineer has been working in saudi arabia for 16 years now - but he does n't have a single saudi friend .
" i only consort with saudis during work , " he says .
" i spend the little time off that i have in the evening with my egyptian friends in coffeehouses or watching soccer . "
when i ask him why he 's got no private contacts to locals , he replies : " for example , we egyptians have our own eating habits . "
that 's all i get from him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikhiit , the plumber of the prince however , he 's very proud of the plumbing job for the saudi prince .
and he 's very grateful to his " normal " saudi employer who allows him to work here during the hajj .
bikhiit likes to live in saudi arabia because he earns more money than in egypt .
but there 's a price to pay for that : he had to give his passport to his employer - as law dictates .
human rights activists argue that this practice establishes a situation of complete dependency .
bikhiit says : " well , at least the passport wo n't get lost . "
his family lives in egypt .
he visits them once a year .
a nepalese in a five star hotel bahadur is a guest worker as well .
he 's from nepal .
the 23-year-old prepares the rooms of a five star hotel and cleans the sanitary installations used by rich pilgrims during the hajj .
" i 'm very happy with the money i make here , " he says .
however , he 's not about to integrate into saudi society .
and nobody has ever asked him to do so , either .
even though the percentage of foreigners living in the kingdom is higher than in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahadur from nepal works in a five star hotel in jeddah i ask a saudi : " is it a problem that few guest workers here speak arabic ? "
" no , " he says - and he obviously does n't quite understand why i would ask him about the language skills of inexpensive foreign workers .
" as long as guest workers do n't consort with people here , that 's not a problem .
besides , many saudis do n't speak english ! "
integration not wanted one of the last people i meet in saudi arabia is faisal , a cab driver from pakistan who takes me to the airport .
i compliment him on his good arabic - but that does n't help him to become socially integrated or to receive a permanent right of residence .
" in the united states and in australia you can become a citizen after five years , " he raves - maybe oversimplifying it a bit .
" but you need to legally live and work in saudi arabia for 20 years in order to get a saudi passport . "
that 's also part of saudi reality : once a guest worker , always a guest worker .
when we part , faisal asks me : " do you have a german passport ? "
" no , " i tell him .
" it 's not that easy to get one .
you first have to legally work and live in germany for 8 years .
there are naturalization tests and you need to have sufficient german language skills .
faisal smiles and i smile back : " at any rate , it 's a lot easier than in saudi arabia . "

he contemplates on how the pilgrimage to mecca has changed his picture of saudi arabia - and talks about his conversations with foreign workers in the country . i 'm sitting among hundreds of thousands of exhausted pilgrims at jeddah airport and i know : it 's all over now .
goodbye to mecca !
thanks for having me .
and i also want to thank all the dw users who cast a critical eye on my journey and posted numerous questions .
your feedback has been a real incitement to my work - and it 's been a lot of fun .
i 'm proud that i was able to reach muslims as well as non-muslims with my diary entries .
by the way , not all of the pilgrims are going home now .
some go on to spend a vacation here , if they can afford it .
many of them stroll along the beaches of the red sea with dark sunglasses .
the hotels are still booked-out .
however , i 'm sitting here at the airport among the many other " flying pilgrims . "
in fact , the rush of people is so heavy that we were asked to be here six hours before departure time .
ex-pilgrims with sunglasses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims at a hotel in jeddah prior to my journey to mecca , i had n't personally met a saudi in my whole life .
i was only familiar with the common prejudices that other arabs like to tell each other about saudis - particularly in yemen , the extremely poor country i come from .
from a yemeni perspective , they easily seem like spoiled " brothers " from a rich neighboring country .
and while saudi arabia has close ties with western countries , it also applies a particularly conservative islamic rule - including whippings and death penalties for violations of the sharia .
my visit was too short to question or change this picture fundamentally .
however , i made some diverging observations that might help to better differentiate between the country 's people and the existing system of government .
all of the saudis that i met in the past days were very friendly - and they were open-minded as well .
let 's take the young men working for the hajj 's organizing committee : all of them had been to college , many of them in foreign countries .
and they all spoke at least three foreign languages .
they love to have fun a lot and spice up their working days with jokes .
at the same time , they 're proud muslims who are very sensitive about utterances associating islam directly or indirectly with extremism or terrorism .
" we utterly reject that , " they say .
" we 're tolerant and open-minded toward non-muslims as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating with multilingual saudi employees of the pilgrim 's office i personally had the feeling that they really meant what they said , and that they were n't just saying it to me because i 'm a journalist from a foreign media company .
however , what about the government 's policies ?
there are a number of facts that can hardly be conveyed to a foreign audience , such as the ban of christian symbols or the exclusion of women from the general public .
what is more , foreigners coming into the country need a saudi resident acting as a guarantor for them .
muhammad is fluent in korean muhammad works for the pilgrimage 's information office as well .
he studied in south korea for five years , where he lived only among locals - he 's fluent in the language .
he still raves about the time in the far east : " koreans are very kind and caring people .
they virtually love foreigners . "
i get the feeling that muhammad was really well-integrated over there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of jiddah these are the moments when you 're sitting in mecca and you 're suddenly reminded of the integration debate going on in germany .
i ask myself : is language really that important when it comes to integration ?
i wonder about that ever since i met bikhiit , a plumber who was hired by a saudi prince only for the days of the hajj .
bikhiit worked on the prince 's luxurious pilgrim 's tent in mecca .
the prince and the plumber bikhiit is from egypt .
aside from his different accent , he 's probably as good in arabic as the saudi prince .
every year , he makes sure that the prince 's pilgrim 's tent is provided with constant warm water .
the sanitary engineer has been working in saudi arabia for 16 years now - but he does n't have a single saudi friend .
" i only consort with saudis during work , " he says .
" i spend the little time off that i have in the evening with my egyptian friends in coffeehouses or watching soccer . "
when i ask him why he 's got no private contacts to locals , he replies : " for example , we egyptians have our own eating habits . "
that 's all i get from him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikhiit , the plumber of the prince however , he 's very proud of the plumbing job for the saudi prince .
and he 's very grateful to his " normal " saudi employer who allows him to work here during the hajj .
bikhiit likes to live in saudi arabia because he earns more money than in egypt .
but there 's a price to pay for that : he had to give his passport to his employer - as law dictates .
human rights activists argue that this practice establishes a situation of complete dependency .
bikhiit says : " well , at least the passport wo n't get lost . "
his family lives in egypt .
he visits them once a year .
a nepalese in a five star hotel bahadur is a guest worker as well .
he 's from nepal .
the 23-year-old prepares the rooms of a five star hotel and cleans the sanitary installations used by rich pilgrims during the hajj .
" i 'm very happy with the money i make here , " he says .
however , he 's not about to integrate into saudi society .
and nobody has ever asked him to do so , either .
even though the percentage of foreigners living in the kingdom is higher than in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahadur from nepal works in a five star hotel in jeddah i ask a saudi : " is it a problem that few guest workers here speak arabic ? "
" no , " he says - and he obviously does n't quite understand why i would ask him about the language skills of inexpensive foreign workers .
" as long as guest workers do n't consort with people here , that 's not a problem .
besides , many saudis do n't speak english ! "
integration not wanted one of the last people i meet in saudi arabia is faisal , a cab driver from pakistan who takes me to the airport .
i compliment him on his good arabic - but that does n't help him to become socially integrated or to receive a permanent right of residence .
" in the united states and in australia you can become a citizen after five years , " he raves - maybe oversimplifying it a bit .
" but you need to legally live and work in saudi arabia for 20 years in order to get a saudi passport . "
that 's also part of saudi reality : once a guest worker , always a guest worker .
when we part , faisal asks me : " do you have a german passport ? "
" no , " i tell him .
" it 's not that easy to get one .
you first have to legally work and live in germany for 8 years .
there are naturalization tests and you need to have sufficient german language skills .
faisal smiles and i smile back : " at any rate , it 's a lot easier than in saudi arabia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 22.11.2010 for experts , middle east peace efforts are all but doomed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marathon session between hillary clinton and benjamin netanyahu ended without results direct peace talks between israelis and palestinians have been on hold since september .
while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

" " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else . " meanwhile , google remains under investigation in germany , spain , italy , canada and the us . author : cyrus farivar editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

the mini-aircraft is powered through a focused laser pointed at the uav , rather than relying solely on batteries . unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs have long been used by the military for applications ranging from reconnaissance and surveillance to armed attacks .
while larger uavs are powered in the same way as conventional aircraft , small uavs - under five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- - are battery powered , which generally limits flight time to 20 to 45 minutes .
however , german and american research teams have been working hard to overcome the shortcomings of battery-life and recently set a world record earlier this month at 12 hours , 26 minutes and 56.9 seconds .
the asctec pelican is a small quadrocopter developed by ascending technologies , a young german company based just outside of munich .
the pelican weighs less than a kilogram and is less than 45 cm across -lrb- almost 18 inches -rrb- .
ascending technologies teamed up with lasermotive , an american research company that specializes in laser power technology , and was the winner of the 2009 nasa-sponsored power beaming competition .
in their reach for the holy grail of unlimited power for uavs , researchers fitted solar cells to the underside of the asctec pelican .
when hit by the laser , which can reach up to one kilometer , these cells convert the beam into electrical power and continuously charge the battery .
conceivably , this uav could stay aloft forever , given unlimited laser power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael achtelik is the ceo of ascending technologies , the company behind the asctec pelican the asctec pelican 's battery lasts for 20 minutes , so for it to fly for over 12 hours is a major breakthrough , said michael achtelik , the ceo of ascending technologies , in an interview with deutsche welle .
an order of magnitude greater law enforcement experts also are impressed by the new uav 's hover , or loiter , time .
" a uav that has a 12 hour loiter time , its right off the charts right now , ” said charles " sid " heal , a technology consultant and technology chairman for the national tactical officers association in the united states .
heal is also a former commander in the los angeles county sheriffs department .
" to give you an example , the best hover uav that we have in the united states right now , even under the most ideal conditions , would have a loiter time less than one hour .
so they 've increased the loiter time by one order of magnitude . "
beyond law enforcement officials , others in the scientific community say that this new approach shows promise .
" it shows how much energy can be transferred via this laser powered system , since the quadrocopter system needs about three times more energy than a conventional fixed wing uav , " said gordon strickert , a research scientist at the german aerospace center in braunschweig .
" it also shows that such a quadrocoptor system can be flown very precisely and can hold its position accurately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new uav record is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently available in the united states restricted use of uavs in the united states uav 's are currently not authorized for use in law enforcement in the united states , much to heal 's chagrin .
he said this kind of breakthrough could make a real difference in law enforcement in the united states , where he worked swat for many years .
" some of our incidents were in high-rise buildings , " he said , noting that uavs have particular advantages over helicopters , in that they 're significantly cheaper , quieter and much less visible .
" one of the most vulnerable places is the windows , but yet we ca n't see in the windows .
we could actually take a uav and park it up 20 stories and literally look right in the window as if we were standing on the ground . "
drawbacks of laser power despite the new hover record , the laser power has its flaws , too , noted strickert .
" you need a powerful laser and a tracking system and a power supply on the ground , ” he said .
strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

he 's accused of war crimes committed seven years ago in the central african republic but has denied all charges . in july 2006 , during the election in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- , jean-pierre bemba seemed poised to become the country 's next president .
it did n't happen .
his opponent , joseph kabila , won the vote .
about a year later bemba fled to portugal after clashes between his bodyguards and soldiers loyal to kabila .
in may 2008 , he was arrested by belgian police and two months later he was in a prison not far from the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
on monday , the former vice president of congo , a rebel leader and leader of congo 's main opposition party stood before judges at the icc , charged with three counts of war crimes and two counts of crimes against humanity for murder , rape and pillage allegedly committed by his movement for the liberation of congo -lrb- mlc -rrb- rebel forces in the central african republic from october 2002 to march 2003 . mlc soldiers had been invited into the central african republic by then-president ange-felix patasse to help put down a coup .
the coup leader , former army chief francois bozize , overthrew patasse and in 2004 called in the icc to investigate .
according to the lawyer for the victims of bemba 's alleged crimes , monday is a very important day .
" even if it can never make up for the harm done , the victims need to know the truth and have the possibility to tell their stories , " said marie-edith lawson of the association of women lawyers in the central african republic .
" the culprits must be punished .
that would give at least some moral satisfaction to the victims . "
local leader at fault , supporters say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bemba during happier days before congolese elections in 2006 but supporters of bemba say the drc senator and wealthy businessman is not guilty of the charges brought against him .
even if bemba was the leader of the mlc , he did n't have anything to do with atrocities committed in the central african republic .
according to bemba 's lawyer , aime kilolo , it needs to be clarified who was the real military leader involved - not of the mcl overall , but from the contingent stationed in bangui in the period during which the alleged crimes took place .
" our position is clear : the central african government asked the mlc for soldiers and these men were made available to a sovereign state , " said kilolo .
" therefore it is not possible to say that jean-pierre bemba was the local leader . "
bemba 's lawyers have repeatedly submitted petitions to get the case dismissed .
responsible as leader but to prosecutors and joint plaintiffs , bemba 's location during the atrocities is not the deciding factor in determining his innocence or guilt .
lawson says that just because bemba was not at the location where the atrocities took place does not mean that he did not know about them .
he could have just as well given orders from afar , she says .
it 's this aspect of the case that makes it so unusual .
to win their case , prosecutors must prove that those committing the crimes were bemba 's subordinates , that he had knowledge of the crimes and that he constantly failed to act or punish those crimes .
" this is the first trail in which someone must take responsibility as a military leader and not as a perpetrator or accomplice , " said fadil abdallah , the legal outreach officer at the icc .
" the international criminal court is thereby sending a strong signal that there is no immunity from prosecution for someone who holds political or administrative responsibility in his country . "
bildunterschrift : prosecutors at the icc must prove bemba 's subordinates committed the crimes big trial , big challenges but experts have said a case like this can be tough to prove .
the trial is expected to last several months .
the court has accepted 135 victims as participants in this trial and at least 37 are expected to testify .
another 1,200 applications from other victims are under consideration .
preparations have already been going on for more than two years .
besides the legal challenges facing the court , it also has an obligation to communicate often complicated trial proceedings across thousands of miles to populations in two central african countries , where infrastructures are often creaking at best .
in the drc at least , the icc has been accused of failing to communicate with local people , leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings on both sides .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .
the sooner australia becomes a republic and finally shakes the shackles of great britain the better for all .
viva la republique de australie .
i dream of a new day i do . - stuart , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.11.2010 does germany need color-coded security ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : battening down the hatches at the reichstag experts disagree on the merits of terror alert levels as germany steps up security over concerns of a possible islamist attack .
the country does not have a warning system like those in the uk and the us . one of germany 's most popular tourist attractions , the glass dome of the reichstag in berlin , was closed to tourists on monday following media reports of a plot by islamist extremists to attack the german parliament building .
in several incidents across germany these past days , police cordoned off abandoned packages after what turned out to be false alarms .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel moved to reassure the population , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that security forces were doing everything in their power to protect the country , just days after the interior minister announced there was a " new security situation " in germany .
it is high time authorities started considering adopting a system of terror warning levels in germany , philipp holtmann , a terrorism expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- told deutsche welle .
code red ? " if we look at the situation we are confronted with right now , we are on the borderline between panicking and hysteria -lsb- on the one hand -rsb- and absolute negligence of the situation -lsb- on the other -rsb- ; people do not know how to estimate the threat that really exists , " he said .
terror alert levels would make it much easier for the population to deal with the threats , holtmann said , because there would be more clarity than there is now : " every hour , we have new reports in the media that give us different scenarios , that tell us different confusing and often contradicting facts , and it would be much easier for the population if there was a clear terror warning alert system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go about your daily life , experts say people can not prevent terrorism , holtmann said , but according to a warning system , people could raise or lower their awareness for things going on around them .
they should continue to keep on living their normal lives but be more alert : " there is no recipe how to do this .
it is not this bag or this person , this language or this culture that needs to be watched , it 's a general awareness , " he said .
in the us , the homeland security advisory system codes threat levels from yellow , or elevated , to red , or severe and accordingly issues warnings to the public .
britain has a system of five threat levels ranging from low to critical .
disagreement over step-by-step warning systems george kassimeris , a senior research fellow in conflict and terrorism at the university of wolverhampton in the uk , said germany would be ill-advised in following the british and us terror alert example .
the systems made sense in theory , he told deutsche welle , but in practice they could be counterproductive : " with all these different levels and colors , the end result is a certain degree of panic , confusion and anxiety among the population because the population are not in possession of the knowledge and information the intelligence services are when they issue all these different warnings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the police prepared ?
the intelligence services , the british expert said , would never notify the public in advance of an imminent terror threat because if they did , they would be giving the game away to the terrorists .
" ordinary people can do absolutely nothing about it " kassimeris said that at first , people heed terror warnings , but at some point , they stop paying attention because they make no difference to their lives .
terrorism has become a part of our lives , kassimeris said , and it is bound to continue to be a part of our lives because there will always be people who resort to violence to advance their fanatical beliefs .
" the population can not possibly be prepared , " according to kassimeris - but the intelligence and security agencies can . the debate should not be about whether the public was prepared , he said , but whether the security services who are responsible for protecting people 's safety are prepared to the very maximum to deal with the threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.11.2010 eu agrees bailout for ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland has admitted it needs financial help eu finance ministers have agreed on a bailout fund for ireland to tackle the country 's huge budget deficit and save its banking sector .
it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .
the euro had faced heavy selling recently due to concerns over ireland 's debts ' impact on the economic bloc .

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .

while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

'
limited background information on the pirates could hamper the case . the first pirate trial to take place in germany in 400 years has opened in hamburg .
more than seven months after the attack on the hamburg-registered container ship ms taipan , 10 somali men are standing trial .
they are charged with attacking the ship some 900 kilometers -lrb- 560 miles -rrb- east of the somali coast in april .
one of the defendants has told the court that he was 13 years old at the time of the attack , which would mean he could not be tried under german law .
experts in the court believe he is likely 15 or older ; however , with little reliable documentation on the youngster , this could be difficult to prove .
" a child should not be obliged to stand in court , if his given age of 13 is correct , " the chair of the judging panel , bernd steinmetz said .
the eldest accused said he was 48 , while the other eight all stated ages between 16 and 28 ; but none of them could give his precise date of birth .
the accused have been communicating via interpreters , as they do n't speak german .
possible sentences between 10 and 15 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taipan was freed by dutch marines nobody was injured when the taipan vessel was taken hostage in april .
the ship 's 15-man crew fled to a safety room when the pirates boarded their ship , and the pirates were eventually captured by dutch naval forces .
the alleged pirates were extradited to germany in june .
since then , they have been in custody awaiting trial .
the defendants could get sentences of anywhere from 10 to 15 years in prison if found guilty .
the prosecution says it has evidence that the men were in possession of kalashnikov rifles , grenade launchers , knives and ladders for boarding ships .
the team of 20 defense lawyers jointly appealed to the court to consider the circumstances in somalia , an all-but lawless country racked by two decades of civil war , where they said life was marked by hunger , terror and a lack of medicine .
" the somali people are suffering ; there is no possibility of fleeing within the country , " the lawyers argued .
piracy is a growing problem off the coast of somalia , with both the number of attacks and the ransoms demanded spiking over the past two years , the london-based international maritime bureau told afp news service .
some 23 vessels and 500 crew are currently held by somali pirates , the bureau said .

the allocation scam is thought to have cost the government over us $ 35 billion . former telecoms minister a. raja , who was forced to resign earlier this month , is alleged to have issued 2g licenses in january 2008 at prices well below market value .
these frequencies are used to transmit phone calls and text messages to mobile phones . " mr clean 's " reputation at risk the controversy has now engulfed prime minister manmohan singh , whose reputation as " mr clean " is at risk , with the supreme court asking him to explain why mr raja has still not been prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the organizers of the commonwealth games in delhi have been arrested " the role of the prime minister is in question , " explained gurudas dasgupta , an mp from the communist party of india , recalling a similar scandal involving an indian stockbroker who is alleged to have engineered a rise in the bombay stock exchange . " in 1991 when the harshad mehta scam came to light , i raised the matter in the rajya sabha -lrb- upper house of parliament -rrb- , " he says .
" our fingers were raised against the finance ministry .
at that time , the finance minister was manmohan singh .
he agreed to a joint parliamentary committee -lrb- jpc -rrb- , even when his role was being questioned .
today , his role as pm is being questioned . " the telecom scam is just one of the current scandals to haunt the government .
the ruling congress was recently forced to sack ashok chavan , chief minister of the important state of maharashtra , after he and other politicians were found to have colluded to obtain luxury flats that were destined for war widows . before that the government had launched a multiple-agency probe into the commonwealth games after fingers were pointed at the chief organizer suresh kalmadi .
two of his aides have already been arrested by anti-corruption investigators . " if you are not part of the oligarchy , you are out " however , the ruling party is not alone to be embroiled in scandal .
the major opposition bharatiya janata party also faces charges , particularly in the southern state of karnataka , whose chief minister , b s yedyurappa , is currently entangled in a land scam . " corruption has made people prosperous through the shorter route , " deplored kiran bedi , one of india ’ s most-celebrated women police officers and a vocal campaigner against corruption . " there is now a cozy relationship between bureaucrats , corporations and politicians – an oligarchic capitalism of corruption .
if you are not part of this oligarchy , you are out of the system , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian communications and information technology minister a. raja was forced to resign earlier this month prime minister has to show " vision " according to transparency international 's corruption perceptions index for 2010 , india has slipped three places to 87 out of 178 this year . though the scandals pose no immediate threat to singh 's government , they are likely to delay the passage of more reform bills . " this is going to continue because the opportunities in india are going to increase , " warned analyst samar harlankar . " in the last 20 years , the receipts to government have grown by more than 10 .
our economy is going to grow and the opportunities are always going to be there .
so this has to be struck at and punishment has to be shown .
the prime minister himself has to get involved .
he has to show vision .

but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .

really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.11.2010 reichstag dome closed to public after terror warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reichstag dome is a popular tourist destination amid heightened concern about a possible terror attack on german soil , the glass dome of the country 's parliament has been closed to the public .
politicians warned that some dangers were being overstated . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has said that security agencies are working to prevent a possible terror attack , but he criticized news organizations for their reporting on the threat , saying it was a danger in its own right .
speaking on a german news talk show on sunday evening , de maiziere took pains to distance himself from " irresponsible speculation " about terror threats published by weekly news magazine der spiegel and other news outlets .
after de maiziere had given a terror warning earlier in the week , der spiegel reported that al-qaeda operatives were planning a bloody hostage-taking attack on the reichstag , in berlin , before the end of november .
the reichstag is the seat of german parliament .
on monday , the glassed-in cupola of the reichstag - a favorite tourist destination - was closed to the public , although pre-arranged group tours were still taking place .
closing the reichstag but on sunday , de maiziere warned , " speculation has a psychological effect in itself .
it also spreads fear . "
he assured the public that the government is " taking the threat seriously , without being completely sure " about what the threat is , or when an attack would be expected .
the government 's terror warning on wednesday was reportedly based on internal sources .
der spiegel cited a jihadist who contacted the german authorities , as well as data from foreign intelligence sources , including the fbi .
the interior ministry has not issued denials on the sources of the reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere has said the security forces can not guarantee absolute safety other conservative politicians jumped on the message of warning against spreading panic over the terror threats as well .
on sunday , christian democrat home affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told the bild newspaper that : " we need the right balance between alertness and calm , and we should n't change our daily lives . "
he said the likelihood of having a traffic accident was higher than of being the victim of a terror attack , adding " nonetheless i get into my car , a bus or a train every day . "
increased security measures for his part , de maiziere told moderator will that there was " no answer to how we have to act so as to completely avoid terrorism , " nor was there any point in trying to placate terrorists .
" if we do what terrorists tell us - like immediately withdraw from afghanistan , or introduce sharia law in germany , … even that might not stop them .
we have to behave how we see fit . "
de maiziere 's warning on wednesday led to increased security at airports and train stations across germany .
for the few weeks prior to the alert , he had repeatedly played down a number of reports and warnings from the us about possible terrorist assaults in europe .
germany has not been hit by a major islamist terror attack in the past decade , although there have been a number of planned attacks which were prevented or which failed .
but german troops ' engagement in afghanistan has brought the country closer to the attention of islamic radicals . but now , german police say , the danger of an islamist terrorist attack in germany has never been more specific .
the head of the german police force , matthias seeger , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper that there have been a number of tip-offs from different sources .
on tuesday , a parliamentary committee will be holding a special session to discuss the current threat level , christian democrat lawmaker stefan mueller told dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an international un effort in the 1990s there failed .
in 2007 , neighboring ethiopia invaded - with backing by the united states - but could n't bring about the desired stability in somalia , either . since 2009 , a western-backed interim government under moderate islamic politician sheikh sharif ahmed has been struggling to hold on to power in central mogadishu .
it can only do so with the help of 7,000 african union -lrb- au -rrb- soldiers .
large parts of the rest of the country are controlled by al shabab militia . the al qaeda-linked shabab militia allegedly has fighters from afghanistan , pakistan and chechnya in their ranks .
the estimated 7,000 militants are well-armed and supported primarily by neighboring eritrea .
but funding also comes from arab circles who want to push back western influence in the region . this is also a reason why western countries do n't want to leave somalia to its own devices , said georges-marc andre , the european commission 's special envoy for somalia .
there 's too much at stake on the horn of africa , he said .
after all , somalia controlled one of the most significant sea routes in international shipping through its position on the gulf of aden .
but the stability of the entire region could also be threatened by somali backed radical islamists , he said . " clearly the war has been started by somalis , " andre said .
" but they are also victims of those who are looking to use somalia as a platform to destabilize the region , whether you speak of the middle east , the states in the arabian gulf or some african countries such as ethiopia , kenya or uganda . " a humanitarian catastrophe andre coordinates eu aid for the collapsed nation from nairobi in neighboring kenya .
in 2010 alone , the eu has made 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid and state-building efforts in somalia .
when the security situation permits , he travels to mogadishu to get a picture of the current situation in somalia .
but there is nothing for andre to gloss over when it comes to the circumstances in the horn of africa . " when you look at the terrorist attacks , when you look at all those civilians who are being killed - including kids and women - when you see the al shabab actions being carried out by child soldiers , when you look at all of this , obviously the situation is awful , " andre said . the civilian population has to bear the brunt of the chaos .
there are 1.5 million internally displaced persons in somalia .
but it is virtually impossible to get humanitarian help to those in need , as the shabab prevent western aid organizations from accessing regions they control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has had no central government since siad barre was overthrown in 1991 " if you look at the needs in the al shabab controlled areas , you will see a very patchy distribution with some dark places where nobody today is about to deliver healthcare , water or nutrition for the children , " said philippe royan , head of the somalia office of the european commission humanitarian aid department . in addition , humanitarian workers are " not welcome " to monitor and assess the population 's needs , royan said . crucial african union support according to experts , the interim government in mogadishu supported by the west would collapse within a few days if it was not protected by the 7,000 au soldiers .
but their deployment since 2007 has only progressed sluggishly .
the au 's contingent still has n't reached its required strength , said wafula wamunyinyi , the deputy special representative from the au commission for somalia . he said the deployment in somalia was supposed to take place in phases .
the first phase was mogadishu . " then after securing mogadishu , where the government would then operate , the next phase was to extend to the countryside , of course with an increased number of troops , and other parts of the country , " wamunyinyi said .
" we are quite on track .
it 's just that there has been some delay due to the slow pace at which countries have deployed their troops . " an investment in the future eu countries finance the au mission in somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- indirectly , for example by training 2,000 somali soldiers in uganda .
for special envoy andre , helping to rebuild somalia is an investment in the future .
after all , western nations ' security was also dependent on the african country 's stability , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers belonging to islamist militias are patrolling mogadishu " if your neighbors like the somalis are in trouble , you have to be worried about peace in europe , " he said .
" what we have to invest now is nothing compared to what we would have to invest in the future if we do n't do something to stabilize and bring back peace in somalia . " according to andre , the impact piracy has had on world trade was a prime example of where somalia was heading .
somali pirates were responsible for 44 percent of the 289 piracy incidents on the world 's seas in the first nine months of 2010 , according to a report published by the international maritime bureau . " that is the reason why we should invest now in somalia , now that time is still there to do something positive with reasonable means , " andre said . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .

ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .

details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .
the euro had faced heavy selling recently due to concerns over ireland 's debts ' impact on the economic bloc .

the mini-aircraft is powered through a focused laser pointed at the uav , rather than relying solely on batteries . unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs have long been used by the military for applications ranging from reconnaissance and surveillance to armed attacks .
while larger uavs are powered in the same way as conventional aircraft , small uavs - under five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- - are battery powered , which generally limits flight time to 20 to 45 minutes .
however , german and american research teams have been working hard to overcome the shortcomings of battery-life and recently set a world record earlier this month at 12 hours , 26 minutes and 56.9 seconds .
the asctec pelican is a small quadrocopter developed by ascending technologies , a young german company based just outside of munich .
the pelican weighs less than a kilogram and is less than 45 cm across -lrb- almost 18 inches -rrb- .
ascending technologies teamed up with lasermotive , an american research company that specializes in laser power technology , and was the winner of the 2009 nasa-sponsored power beaming competition .
in their reach for the holy grail of unlimited power for uavs , researchers fitted solar cells to the underside of the asctec pelican .
when hit by the laser , which can reach up to one kilometer , these cells convert the beam into electrical power and continuously charge the battery .
conceivably , this uav could stay aloft forever , given unlimited laser power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael achtelik is the ceo of ascending technologies , the company behind the asctec pelican the asctec pelican 's battery lasts for 20 minutes , so for it to fly for over 12 hours is a major breakthrough , said michael achtelik , the ceo of ascending technologies , in an interview with deutsche welle .
an order of magnitude greater law enforcement experts also are impressed by the new uav 's hover , or loiter , time .
" a uav that has a 12 hour loiter time , its right off the charts right now , ” said charles " sid " heal , a technology consultant and technology chairman for the national tactical officers association in the united states .
heal is also a former commander in the los angeles county sheriffs department .
" to give you an example , the best hover uav that we have in the united states right now , even under the most ideal conditions , would have a loiter time less than one hour .
so they 've increased the loiter time by one order of magnitude . "
beyond law enforcement officials , others in the scientific community say that this new approach shows promise .
" it shows how much energy can be transferred via this laser powered system , since the quadrocopter system needs about three times more energy than a conventional fixed wing uav , " said gordon strickert , a research scientist at the german aerospace center in braunschweig .
" it also shows that such a quadrocoptor system can be flown very precisely and can hold its position accurately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new uav record is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently available in the united states restricted use of uavs in the united states uav 's are currently not authorized for use in law enforcement in the united states , much to heal 's chagrin .
he said this kind of breakthrough could make a real difference in law enforcement in the united states , where he worked swat for many years .
" some of our incidents were in high-rise buildings , " he said , noting that uavs have particular advantages over helicopters , in that they 're significantly cheaper , quieter and much less visible .
" one of the most vulnerable places is the windows , but yet we ca n't see in the windows .
we could actually take a uav and park it up 20 stories and literally look right in the window as if we were standing on the ground . "
drawbacks of laser power despite the new hover record , the laser power has its flaws , too , noted strickert .
" you need a powerful laser and a tracking system and a power supply on the ground , ” he said .
strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

the asctec pelican is a small quadrocopter developed by ascending technologies , a young german company based just outside of munich .
the pelican weighs less than a kilogram and is less than 45 cm across -lrb- almost 18 inches -rrb- .
ascending technologies teamed up with lasermotive , an american research company that specializes in laser power technology , and was the winner of the 2009 nasa-sponsored power beaming competition .
in their reach for the holy grail of unlimited power for uavs , researchers fitted solar cells to the underside of the asctec pelican .
when hit by the laser , which can reach up to one kilometer , these cells convert the beam into electrical power and continuously charge the battery .
conceivably , this uav could stay aloft forever , given unlimited laser power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael achtelik is the ceo of ascending technologies , the company behind the asctec pelican the asctec pelican 's battery lasts for 20 minutes , so for it to fly for over 12 hours is a major breakthrough , said michael achtelik , the ceo of ascending technologies , in an interview with deutsche welle .
an order of magnitude greater law enforcement experts also are impressed by the new uav 's hover , or loiter , time .
" a uav that has a 12 hour loiter time , its right off the charts right now , ” said charles " sid " heal , a technology consultant and technology chairman for the national tactical officers association in the united states .
heal is also a former commander in the los angeles county sheriffs department .
" to give you an example , the best hover uav that we have in the united states right now , even under the most ideal conditions , would have a loiter time less than one hour .
so they 've increased the loiter time by one order of magnitude . "
beyond law enforcement officials , others in the scientific community say that this new approach shows promise .
" it shows how much energy can be transferred via this laser powered system , since the quadrocopter system needs about three times more energy than a conventional fixed wing uav , " said gordon strickert , a research scientist at the german aerospace center in braunschweig .
" it also shows that such a quadrocoptor system can be flown very precisely and can hold its position accurately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new uav record is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently available in the united states restricted use of uavs in the united states uav 's are currently not authorized for use in law enforcement in the united states , much to heal 's chagrin .
he said this kind of breakthrough could make a real difference in law enforcement in the united states , where he worked swat for many years .
" some of our incidents were in high-rise buildings , " he said , noting that uavs have particular advantages over helicopters , in that they 're significantly cheaper , quieter and much less visible .
" one of the most vulnerable places is the windows , but yet we ca n't see in the windows .
we could actually take a uav and park it up 20 stories and literally look right in the window as if we were standing on the ground . "
drawbacks of laser power despite the new hover record , the laser power has its flaws , too , noted strickert .
" you need a powerful laser and a tracking system and a power supply on the ground , ” he said .
strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

he 's accused of war crimes committed seven years ago in the central african republic but has denied all charges . in july 2006 , during the election in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- , jean-pierre bemba seemed poised to become the country 's next president .
it did n't happen .
his opponent , joseph kabila , won the vote .
about a year later bemba fled to portugal after clashes between his bodyguards and soldiers loyal to kabila .
in may 2008 , he was arrested by belgian police and two months later he was in a prison not far from the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
on monday , the former vice president of congo , a rebel leader and leader of congo 's main opposition party stood before judges at the icc , charged with three counts of war crimes and two counts of crimes against humanity for murder , rape and pillage allegedly committed by his movement for the liberation of congo -lrb- mlc -rrb- rebel forces in the central african republic from october 2002 to march 2003 . mlc soldiers had been invited into the central african republic by then-president ange-felix patasse to help put down a coup .
the coup leader , former army chief francois bozize , overthrew patasse and in 2004 called in the icc to investigate .
according to the lawyer for the victims of bemba 's alleged crimes , monday is a very important day .
" even if it can never make up for the harm done , the victims need to know the truth and have the possibility to tell their stories , " said marie-edith lawson of the association of women lawyers in the central african republic .
" the culprits must be punished .
that would give at least some moral satisfaction to the victims . "
local leader at fault , supporters say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bemba during happier days before congolese elections in 2006 but supporters of bemba say the drc senator and wealthy businessman is not guilty of the charges brought against him .
even if bemba was the leader of the mlc , he did n't have anything to do with atrocities committed in the central african republic .
according to bemba 's lawyer , aime kilolo , it needs to be clarified who was the real military leader involved - not of the mcl overall , but from the contingent stationed in bangui in the period during which the alleged crimes took place .
" our position is clear : the central african government asked the mlc for soldiers and these men were made available to a sovereign state , " said kilolo .
" therefore it is not possible to say that jean-pierre bemba was the local leader . "
bemba 's lawyers have repeatedly submitted petitions to get the case dismissed .
responsible as leader but to prosecutors and joint plaintiffs , bemba 's location during the atrocities is not the deciding factor in determining his innocence or guilt .
lawson says that just because bemba was not at the location where the atrocities took place does not mean that he did not know about them .
he could have just as well given orders from afar , she says .
it 's this aspect of the case that makes it so unusual .
to win their case , prosecutors must prove that those committing the crimes were bemba 's subordinates , that he had knowledge of the crimes and that he constantly failed to act or punish those crimes .
" this is the first trail in which someone must take responsibility as a military leader and not as a perpetrator or accomplice , " said fadil abdallah , the legal outreach officer at the icc .
" the international criminal court is thereby sending a strong signal that there is no immunity from prosecution for someone who holds political or administrative responsibility in his country . "
bildunterschrift : prosecutors at the icc must prove bemba 's subordinates committed the crimes big trial , big challenges but experts have said a case like this can be tough to prove .
the trial is expected to last several months .
the court has accepted 135 victims as participants in this trial and at least 37 are expected to testify .
another 1,200 applications from other victims are under consideration .
preparations have already been going on for more than two years .
besides the legal challenges facing the court , it also has an obligation to communicate often complicated trial proceedings across thousands of miles to populations in two central african countries , where infrastructures are often creaking at best .
in the drc at least , the icc has been accused of failing to communicate with local people , leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings on both sides .

on monday , the former vice president of congo , a rebel leader and leader of congo 's main opposition party stood before judges at the icc , charged with three counts of war crimes and two counts of crimes against humanity for murder , rape and pillage allegedly committed by his movement for the liberation of congo -lrb- mlc -rrb- rebel forces in the central african republic from october 2002 to march 2003 . mlc soldiers had been invited into the central african republic by then-president ange-felix patasse to help put down a coup .
the coup leader , former army chief francois bozize , overthrew patasse and in 2004 called in the icc to investigate .
according to the lawyer for the victims of bemba 's alleged crimes , monday is a very important day .
" even if it can never make up for the harm done , the victims need to know the truth and have the possibility to tell their stories , " said marie-edith lawson of the association of women lawyers in the central african republic .
" the culprits must be punished .
that would give at least some moral satisfaction to the victims . "
local leader at fault , supporters say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bemba during happier days before congolese elections in 2006 but supporters of bemba say the drc senator and wealthy businessman is not guilty of the charges brought against him .
even if bemba was the leader of the mlc , he did n't have anything to do with atrocities committed in the central african republic .
according to bemba 's lawyer , aime kilolo , it needs to be clarified who was the real military leader involved - not of the mcl overall , but from the contingent stationed in bangui in the period during which the alleged crimes took place .
" our position is clear : the central african government asked the mlc for soldiers and these men were made available to a sovereign state , " said kilolo .
" therefore it is not possible to say that jean-pierre bemba was the local leader . "
bemba 's lawyers have repeatedly submitted petitions to get the case dismissed .
responsible as leader but to prosecutors and joint plaintiffs , bemba 's location during the atrocities is not the deciding factor in determining his innocence or guilt .
lawson says that just because bemba was not at the location where the atrocities took place does not mean that he did not know about them .
he could have just as well given orders from afar , she says .
it 's this aspect of the case that makes it so unusual .
to win their case , prosecutors must prove that those committing the crimes were bemba 's subordinates , that he had knowledge of the crimes and that he constantly failed to act or punish those crimes .
" this is the first trail in which someone must take responsibility as a military leader and not as a perpetrator or accomplice , " said fadil abdallah , the legal outreach officer at the icc .
" the international criminal court is thereby sending a strong signal that there is no immunity from prosecution for someone who holds political or administrative responsibility in his country . "
bildunterschrift : prosecutors at the icc must prove bemba 's subordinates committed the crimes big trial , big challenges but experts have said a case like this can be tough to prove .
the trial is expected to last several months .
the court has accepted 135 victims as participants in this trial and at least 37 are expected to testify .
another 1,200 applications from other victims are under consideration .
preparations have already been going on for more than two years .
besides the legal challenges facing the court , it also has an obligation to communicate often complicated trial proceedings across thousands of miles to populations in two central african countries , where infrastructures are often creaking at best .
in the drc at least , the icc has been accused of failing to communicate with local people , leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings on both sides .

'
limited background information on the pirates could hamper the case . the first pirate trial to take place in germany in 400 years has opened in hamburg .
more than seven months after the attack on the hamburg-registered container ship ms taipan , 10 somali men are standing trial .
they are charged with attacking the ship some 900 kilometers -lrb- 560 miles -rrb- east of the somali coast in april .
one of the defendants has told the court that he was 13 years old at the time of the attack , which would mean he could not be tried under german law .
experts in the court believe he is likely 15 or older ; however , with little reliable documentation on the youngster , this could be difficult to prove .
" a child should not be obliged to stand in court , if his given age of 13 is correct , " the chair of the judging panel , bernd steinmetz said .
the eldest accused said he was 48 , while the other eight all stated ages between 16 and 28 ; but none of them could give his precise date of birth .
the accused have been communicating via interpreters , as they do n't speak german .
possible sentences between 10 and 15 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taipan was freed by dutch marines nobody was injured when the taipan vessel was taken hostage in april .
the ship 's 15-man crew fled to a safety room when the pirates boarded their ship , and the pirates were eventually captured by dutch naval forces .
the alleged pirates were extradited to germany in june .
since then , they have been in custody awaiting trial .
the defendants could get sentences of anywhere from 10 to 15 years in prison if found guilty .
the prosecution says it has evidence that the men were in possession of kalashnikov rifles , grenade launchers , knives and ladders for boarding ships .
the team of 20 defense lawyers jointly appealed to the court to consider the circumstances in somalia , an all-but lawless country racked by two decades of civil war , where they said life was marked by hunger , terror and a lack of medicine .
" the somali people are suffering ; there is no possibility of fleeing within the country , " the lawyers argued .
piracy is a growing problem off the coast of somalia , with both the number of attacks and the ransoms demanded spiking over the past two years , the london-based international maritime bureau told afp news service .
some 23 vessels and 500 crew are currently held by somali pirates , the bureau said .

the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.11.2010 reichstag dome closed to public after terror warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reichstag dome is a popular tourist destination amid heightened concern about a possible terror attack on german soil , the glass dome of the country 's parliament has been closed to the public .
politicians warned that some dangers were being overstated . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has said that security agencies are working to prevent a possible terror attack , but he criticized news organizations for their reporting on the threat , saying it was a danger in its own right .
speaking on a german news talk show on sunday evening , de maiziere took pains to distance himself from " irresponsible speculation " about terror threats published by weekly news magazine der spiegel and other news outlets .
after de maiziere had given a terror warning earlier in the week , der spiegel reported that al-qaeda operatives were planning a bloody hostage-taking attack on the reichstag , in berlin , before the end of november .
the reichstag is the seat of german parliament .
on monday , the glassed-in cupola of the reichstag - a favorite tourist destination - was closed to the public , although pre-arranged group tours were still taking place .
closing the reichstag but on sunday , de maiziere warned , " speculation has a psychological effect in itself .
it also spreads fear . "
he assured the public that the government is " taking the threat seriously , without being completely sure " about what the threat is , or when an attack would be expected .
the government 's terror warning on wednesday was reportedly based on internal sources .
der spiegel cited a jihadist who contacted the german authorities , as well as data from foreign intelligence sources , including the fbi .
the interior ministry has not issued denials on the sources of the reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere has said the security forces can not guarantee absolute safety other conservative politicians jumped on the message of warning against spreading panic over the terror threats as well .
on sunday , christian democrat home affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told the bild newspaper that : " we need the right balance between alertness and calm , and we should n't change our daily lives . "
he said the likelihood of having a traffic accident was higher than of being the victim of a terror attack , adding " nonetheless i get into my car , a bus or a train every day . "
increased security measures for his part , de maiziere told moderator will that there was " no answer to how we have to act so as to completely avoid terrorism , " nor was there any point in trying to placate terrorists .
" if we do what terrorists tell us - like immediately withdraw from afghanistan , or introduce sharia law in germany , … even that might not stop them .
we have to behave how we see fit . "
de maiziere 's warning on wednesday led to increased security at airports and train stations across germany .
for the few weeks prior to the alert , he had repeatedly played down a number of reports and warnings from the us about possible terrorist assaults in europe .
germany has not been hit by a major islamist terror attack in the past decade , although there have been a number of planned attacks which were prevented or which failed .
but german troops ' engagement in afghanistan has brought the country closer to the attention of islamic radicals . but now , german police say , the danger of an islamist terrorist attack in germany has never been more specific .
the head of the german police force , matthias seeger , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper that there have been a number of tip-offs from different sources .
on tuesday , a parliamentary committee will be holding a special session to discuss the current threat level , christian democrat lawmaker stefan mueller told dpa news agency .

politicians warned that some dangers were being overstated . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has said that security agencies are working to prevent a possible terror attack , but he criticized news organizations for their reporting on the threat , saying it was a danger in its own right .
speaking on a german news talk show on sunday evening , de maiziere took pains to distance himself from " irresponsible speculation " about terror threats published by weekly news magazine der spiegel and other news outlets .
after de maiziere had given a terror warning earlier in the week , der spiegel reported that al-qaeda operatives were planning a bloody hostage-taking attack on the reichstag , in berlin , before the end of november .
the reichstag is the seat of german parliament .
on monday , the glassed-in cupola of the reichstag - a favorite tourist destination - was closed to the public , although pre-arranged group tours were still taking place .
closing the reichstag but on sunday , de maiziere warned , " speculation has a psychological effect in itself .
it also spreads fear . "
he assured the public that the government is " taking the threat seriously , without being completely sure " about what the threat is , or when an attack would be expected .
the government 's terror warning on wednesday was reportedly based on internal sources .
der spiegel cited a jihadist who contacted the german authorities , as well as data from foreign intelligence sources , including the fbi .
the interior ministry has not issued denials on the sources of the reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere has said the security forces can not guarantee absolute safety other conservative politicians jumped on the message of warning against spreading panic over the terror threats as well .
on sunday , christian democrat home affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told the bild newspaper that : " we need the right balance between alertness and calm , and we should n't change our daily lives . "
he said the likelihood of having a traffic accident was higher than of being the victim of a terror attack , adding " nonetheless i get into my car , a bus or a train every day . "
increased security measures for his part , de maiziere told moderator will that there was " no answer to how we have to act so as to completely avoid terrorism , " nor was there any point in trying to placate terrorists .
" if we do what terrorists tell us - like immediately withdraw from afghanistan , or introduce sharia law in germany , … even that might not stop them .
we have to behave how we see fit . "
de maiziere 's warning on wednesday led to increased security at airports and train stations across germany .
for the few weeks prior to the alert , he had repeatedly played down a number of reports and warnings from the us about possible terrorist assaults in europe .
germany has not been hit by a major islamist terror attack in the past decade , although there have been a number of planned attacks which were prevented or which failed .
but german troops ' engagement in afghanistan has brought the country closer to the attention of islamic radicals . but now , german police say , the danger of an islamist terrorist attack in germany has never been more specific .
the head of the german police force , matthias seeger , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper that there have been a number of tip-offs from different sources .
on tuesday , a parliamentary committee will be holding a special session to discuss the current threat level , christian democrat lawmaker stefan mueller told dpa news agency .

but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .

the country does not have a warning system like those in the uk and the us . one of germany 's most popular tourist attractions , the glass dome of the reichstag in berlin , was closed to tourists on monday following media reports of a plot by islamist extremists to attack the german parliament building .
in several incidents across germany these past days , police cordoned off abandoned packages after what turned out to be false alarms .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel moved to reassure the population , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that security forces were doing everything in their power to protect the country , just days after the interior minister announced there was a " new security situation " in germany .
it is high time authorities started considering adopting a system of terror warning levels in germany , philipp holtmann , a terrorism expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- told deutsche welle .
code red ? " if we look at the situation we are confronted with right now , we are on the borderline between panicking and hysteria -lsb- on the one hand -rsb- and absolute negligence of the situation -lsb- on the other -rsb- ; people do not know how to estimate the threat that really exists , " he said .
terror alert levels would make it much easier for the population to deal with the threats , holtmann said , because there would be more clarity than there is now : " every hour , we have new reports in the media that give us different scenarios , that tell us different confusing and often contradicting facts , and it would be much easier for the population if there was a clear terror warning alert system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go about your daily life , experts say people can not prevent terrorism , holtmann said , but according to a warning system , people could raise or lower their awareness for things going on around them .
they should continue to keep on living their normal lives but be more alert : " there is no recipe how to do this .
it is not this bag or this person , this language or this culture that needs to be watched , it 's a general awareness , " he said .
in the us , the homeland security advisory system codes threat levels from yellow , or elevated , to red , or severe and accordingly issues warnings to the public .
britain has a system of five threat levels ranging from low to critical .
disagreement over step-by-step warning systems george kassimeris , a senior research fellow in conflict and terrorism at the university of wolverhampton in the uk , said germany would be ill-advised in following the british and us terror alert example .
the systems made sense in theory , he told deutsche welle , but in practice they could be counterproductive : " with all these different levels and colors , the end result is a certain degree of panic , confusion and anxiety among the population because the population are not in possession of the knowledge and information the intelligence services are when they issue all these different warnings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the police prepared ?
the intelligence services , the british expert said , would never notify the public in advance of an imminent terror threat because if they did , they would be giving the game away to the terrorists .
" ordinary people can do absolutely nothing about it " kassimeris said that at first , people heed terror warnings , but at some point , they stop paying attention because they make no difference to their lives .
terrorism has become a part of our lives , kassimeris said , and it is bound to continue to be a part of our lives because there will always be people who resort to violence to advance their fanatical beliefs .
" the population can not possibly be prepared , " according to kassimeris - but the intelligence and security agencies can . the debate should not be about whether the public was prepared , he said , but whether the security services who are responsible for protecting people 's safety are prepared to the very maximum to deal with the threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.11.2010 does germany need color-coded security ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : battening down the hatches at the reichstag experts disagree on the merits of terror alert levels as germany steps up security over concerns of a possible islamist attack .
the country does not have a warning system like those in the uk and the us . one of germany 's most popular tourist attractions , the glass dome of the reichstag in berlin , was closed to tourists on monday following media reports of a plot by islamist extremists to attack the german parliament building .
in several incidents across germany these past days , police cordoned off abandoned packages after what turned out to be false alarms .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel moved to reassure the population , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that security forces were doing everything in their power to protect the country , just days after the interior minister announced there was a " new security situation " in germany .
it is high time authorities started considering adopting a system of terror warning levels in germany , philipp holtmann , a terrorism expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- told deutsche welle .
code red ? " if we look at the situation we are confronted with right now , we are on the borderline between panicking and hysteria -lsb- on the one hand -rsb- and absolute negligence of the situation -lsb- on the other -rsb- ; people do not know how to estimate the threat that really exists , " he said .
terror alert levels would make it much easier for the population to deal with the threats , holtmann said , because there would be more clarity than there is now : " every hour , we have new reports in the media that give us different scenarios , that tell us different confusing and often contradicting facts , and it would be much easier for the population if there was a clear terror warning alert system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go about your daily life , experts say people can not prevent terrorism , holtmann said , but according to a warning system , people could raise or lower their awareness for things going on around them .
they should continue to keep on living their normal lives but be more alert : " there is no recipe how to do this .
it is not this bag or this person , this language or this culture that needs to be watched , it 's a general awareness , " he said .
in the us , the homeland security advisory system codes threat levels from yellow , or elevated , to red , or severe and accordingly issues warnings to the public .
britain has a system of five threat levels ranging from low to critical .
disagreement over step-by-step warning systems george kassimeris , a senior research fellow in conflict and terrorism at the university of wolverhampton in the uk , said germany would be ill-advised in following the british and us terror alert example .
the systems made sense in theory , he told deutsche welle , but in practice they could be counterproductive : " with all these different levels and colors , the end result is a certain degree of panic , confusion and anxiety among the population because the population are not in possession of the knowledge and information the intelligence services are when they issue all these different warnings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the police prepared ?
the intelligence services , the british expert said , would never notify the public in advance of an imminent terror threat because if they did , they would be giving the game away to the terrorists .
" ordinary people can do absolutely nothing about it " kassimeris said that at first , people heed terror warnings , but at some point , they stop paying attention because they make no difference to their lives .
terrorism has become a part of our lives , kassimeris said , and it is bound to continue to be a part of our lives because there will always be people who resort to violence to advance their fanatical beliefs .
" the population can not possibly be prepared , " according to kassimeris - but the intelligence and security agencies can . the debate should not be about whether the public was prepared , he said , but whether the security services who are responsible for protecting people 's safety are prepared to the very maximum to deal with the threat .

but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

but now one ballet dancer is bringing new movement to these solemn ceremonies and finding it can work wonders . georg krawietz was slightly nervous just before the dance performance began in the chapel during his father 's funeral .
the mourners in attendance had never seen anything like it before .
most were over 80 , friends and acquaintances of his dad who died at the age of 88 in a nursing home .
but his nervousness soon faded as the dance got underway .
" i saw that people were interested , and moved , " he said .
" no one there thought that was inappropriate or irreverent . "
four months later , bonn-based dancer felix gruetzner was back in the nursing home 's chapel – this time for the funeral of krawietz 's 85-year-old mother .
he was there to acknowledge the long and full life she had led , but also to express the pain of saying goodbye .
gruetzner does this not through a spoken elegy , but through his body – with soft gestures and restrained movements .
expressing life and loss through dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruetzner at a memorial service in cologne in bare feet and simple , black clothes , gruetzner proceeds up the chapel 's central aisle accompanied by bach 's " cappricio in b-flat . "
at a respectful distance from the coffin , he stretches out his arms , closes his hands into fists , and then pulls them back to his body .
he looks up and down , searchingly , then goes down into a squatting position and makes caressing motions over the ground .
there is where the deceased will find her final resting place , but will it be all that remains ?
in the final part of his dance , gruetzner expresses with his body the transition from death to life - spreading his arms and raising them high .
through movement , he recalls a life not lived in vain , but one that was a precious gift and full of joy .
his face shows the hope for a life beyond death , mourning and tears .
gruetzner , who trained as a dancer , aims to give those in the depth of mourning the courage to embrace life despite the painful loss of a loved one .
" dance can often move people just as much as a good elegy , " he said .
" big emotions are sometimes difficult to capture in words .
dance gives these emotions the space they need . "
according to him , each individual can find his or her interpretation of the dance and find a personal way to mourn , but in the presence of the larger community , which helps in the grieving process .
gruetzner , who originally studied art history , decided to concentrate on dance after working in a publishing house for years .
the 46-year-old was regularly asked to participate in commemorations for the dead in both protestant and catholic churches .
two years ago , he was asked to dance at a large funeral and since then , the requests have kept coming .
" dealing with death and dying all the time is not easy for me either , " he said .
" but life is given new depth and fullness when we face our mortality instead of repressing it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix gruetzner is getting increasing attention for his performances dance of life gruetzner has also learned how helpful and comforting movement can be in times of crisis from the seminars and workshops he offers for people in mourning .
" people who come are often very wound up .
they are often bent over when they walk and their breath is shallow , " he said .
the movement exercises he does with them help counter that , and often lift their spirits .
" mourners often get another perspective on the world all together , " he said .
for him , it 's important that he communicate to his audience the life that he feels waits beyond the veil of death .
he calls his work a dance of life , not of death .
georg krawietz , who asked gruetzner to participate in the funerals of both of his parents , said that he thought gruetzner 's dancing was anything but macabre .
" while watching him dance , i felt not only consoled , but also grounded in my own life , " he said .

while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .

while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de dance -pipe- 22.11.2010 dancing about life at a time of death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruetzner uses dance to express the powerful emotions around death traditionally in germany , dancing and funerals have kept a good distance from one another .
but now one ballet dancer is bringing new movement to these solemn ceremonies and finding it can work wonders . georg krawietz was slightly nervous just before the dance performance began in the chapel during his father 's funeral .
the mourners in attendance had never seen anything like it before .
most were over 80 , friends and acquaintances of his dad who died at the age of 88 in a nursing home .
but his nervousness soon faded as the dance got underway .
" i saw that people were interested , and moved , " he said .
" no one there thought that was inappropriate or irreverent . "
four months later , bonn-based dancer felix gruetzner was back in the nursing home 's chapel – this time for the funeral of krawietz 's 85-year-old mother .
he was there to acknowledge the long and full life she had led , but also to express the pain of saying goodbye .
gruetzner does this not through a spoken elegy , but through his body – with soft gestures and restrained movements .
expressing life and loss through dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruetzner at a memorial service in cologne in bare feet and simple , black clothes , gruetzner proceeds up the chapel 's central aisle accompanied by bach 's " cappricio in b-flat . "
at a respectful distance from the coffin , he stretches out his arms , closes his hands into fists , and then pulls them back to his body .
he looks up and down , searchingly , then goes down into a squatting position and makes caressing motions over the ground .
there is where the deceased will find her final resting place , but will it be all that remains ?
in the final part of his dance , gruetzner expresses with his body the transition from death to life - spreading his arms and raising them high .
through movement , he recalls a life not lived in vain , but one that was a precious gift and full of joy .
his face shows the hope for a life beyond death , mourning and tears .
gruetzner , who trained as a dancer , aims to give those in the depth of mourning the courage to embrace life despite the painful loss of a loved one .
" dance can often move people just as much as a good elegy , " he said .
" big emotions are sometimes difficult to capture in words .
dance gives these emotions the space they need . "
according to him , each individual can find his or her interpretation of the dance and find a personal way to mourn , but in the presence of the larger community , which helps in the grieving process .
gruetzner , who originally studied art history , decided to concentrate on dance after working in a publishing house for years .
the 46-year-old was regularly asked to participate in commemorations for the dead in both protestant and catholic churches .
two years ago , he was asked to dance at a large funeral and since then , the requests have kept coming .
" dealing with death and dying all the time is not easy for me either , " he said .
" but life is given new depth and fullness when we face our mortality instead of repressing it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix gruetzner is getting increasing attention for his performances dance of life gruetzner has also learned how helpful and comforting movement can be in times of crisis from the seminars and workshops he offers for people in mourning .
" people who come are often very wound up .
they are often bent over when they walk and their breath is shallow , " he said .
the movement exercises he does with them help counter that , and often lift their spirits .
" mourners often get another perspective on the world all together , " he said .
for him , it 's important that he communicate to his audience the life that he feels waits beyond the veil of death .
he calls his work a dance of life , not of death .
georg krawietz , who asked gruetzner to participate in the funerals of both of his parents , said that he thought gruetzner 's dancing was anything but macabre .
" while watching him dance , i felt not only consoled , but also grounded in my own life , " he said .

the swiss franc is strong and could scare away skiers paying in other currencies . despite the global economic worries , swiss ski resort operators still hope to attract plenty of visitors this season .
but they admit it could be challenging .
adding to the cost of what is already an expensive sport is the swiss franc , which has gained in value against the euro , the dollar and the pound .
" it 's very difficult to give a prediction , " said daniel luggen , director of tourism director for zermatt , one of switzerland 's most popular resorts with 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- of ski runs and the glorious matterhorn looming above them .
" will they come ?
will we find people ?
we hope that if we lose german guests , we can attract new ones from russia or maybe even asia . "
safe haven for investors luggen admits that many in switzerland are worried about the future .
" the swiss franc really is a safe haven for many investors , " he said .
" of course , this can be a big advantage for some , but for us in the export industry , it 's a hassle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong swiss franc is attracting investors but scaring away skiers interest rates in switzerland are practically at zero , giving the swiss national bank little room for maneuver .
earlier this year , the bank tried buying up euros to slow down the rise of the franc .
but the measure was n't especially effective : the euro has been falling again .
bank chairman phillipp hildebrand knows what his responsibility is , but it 's not clear how many tools he has left .
" our mandate is clear : we have to safeguard price stability and work to stay abreast of the current economic climate , so this will determine our fiscal policy in the future , " hildebrand said .
" we will take the necessary measures to ensure price stability .
that is what we have always said and that continues to be our policy . "
difficult winter ahead but already the swiss department of economic affairs is predicting a 1.5 percent drop in tourism income this winter , and switzerland 's director of national tourism , juerg schmid , is warning resorts of icy economic weather ahead .
" we 're going to have to dress up more warmly this winter , if i can put it that way , " he said .
" after this winter , we hope things will get better .
we should expect an upturn by the end of next year , but this winter will be difficult . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn keeps pulling tourists to zermatt so how can the winter resorts minimize the damage ?
some hotels are offering fixed prices in euros with ski passes thrown in .
ski resort operators in zermatt may be able to avoid a big dip in business , thanks to a base of wealthy customers – and the iconic mountain that keeps bringing them back .
" without the matterhorn , zermatt would not have developed as it has , " luggen said .
" after a nice day of skiing , people like to sit on the mountain terrace and look at the matterhorn in the light of the evening sun .
that 's something they do n't forget quickly .
so for me , responsible for marketing zermatt , the matterhorn , is the best thing i have .

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .

he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 22.11.2010 swiss slopes may be too pricey for many skiers this season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss ski resorts are worried about empty slopes as ski resorts across the alps gear up for the winter season , resort operators in switzerland are worried about their business .
the swiss franc is strong and could scare away skiers paying in other currencies . despite the global economic worries , swiss ski resort operators still hope to attract plenty of visitors this season .
but they admit it could be challenging .
adding to the cost of what is already an expensive sport is the swiss franc , which has gained in value against the euro , the dollar and the pound .
" it 's very difficult to give a prediction , " said daniel luggen , director of tourism director for zermatt , one of switzerland 's most popular resorts with 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- of ski runs and the glorious matterhorn looming above them .
" will they come ?
will we find people ?
we hope that if we lose german guests , we can attract new ones from russia or maybe even asia . "
safe haven for investors luggen admits that many in switzerland are worried about the future .
" the swiss franc really is a safe haven for many investors , " he said .
" of course , this can be a big advantage for some , but for us in the export industry , it 's a hassle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong swiss franc is attracting investors but scaring away skiers interest rates in switzerland are practically at zero , giving the swiss national bank little room for maneuver .
earlier this year , the bank tried buying up euros to slow down the rise of the franc .
but the measure was n't especially effective : the euro has been falling again .
bank chairman phillipp hildebrand knows what his responsibility is , but it 's not clear how many tools he has left .
" our mandate is clear : we have to safeguard price stability and work to stay abreast of the current economic climate , so this will determine our fiscal policy in the future , " hildebrand said .
" we will take the necessary measures to ensure price stability .
that is what we have always said and that continues to be our policy . "
difficult winter ahead but already the swiss department of economic affairs is predicting a 1.5 percent drop in tourism income this winter , and switzerland 's director of national tourism , juerg schmid , is warning resorts of icy economic weather ahead .
" we 're going to have to dress up more warmly this winter , if i can put it that way , " he said .
" after this winter , we hope things will get better .
we should expect an upturn by the end of next year , but this winter will be difficult . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn keeps pulling tourists to zermatt so how can the winter resorts minimize the damage ?
some hotels are offering fixed prices in euros with ski passes thrown in .
ski resort operators in zermatt may be able to avoid a big dip in business , thanks to a base of wealthy customers – and the iconic mountain that keeps bringing them back .
" without the matterhorn , zermatt would not have developed as it has , " luggen said .
" after a nice day of skiing , people like to sit on the mountain terrace and look at the matterhorn in the light of the evening sun .
that 's something they do n't forget quickly .
so for me , responsible for marketing zermatt , the matterhorn , is the best thing i have .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de post and logistics -pipe- 22.11.2010 cargoshell pushes shipping industry to go green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of shipping ?
the shipping industry is a big producer of co2 emissions , but dutch company cargoshell says it 's found a way to be more environmentally friendly and cut costs at the same time . shipping is a multi-billion euro industry that is expected to grow massively in the next decade .
one of the main concerns of the industry in the current economic climate is not only how to reduce costs but also how to be more environmentally friendly .
according to a 2008 un report , shipping creates double the co2 emissions of the aviation industry . dutch company cargoshell thinks its new , foldable fiberglass cargo containers are the solution to both of these problems .
the company claims they are an innovation compared to the steel shipping containers that have been the industry standard for over 50 years .
cargoshell ceo john houtman said the unique folding design of the glass and resin containers make them perfect for cutting costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargoshell 's containers are foldable , making them space-saving when empty " about 25 percent of all shipments are empty containers , " he said .
" when you collapse an empty cargoshell container , it is just a quarter of the normal size .
so when you transport the containers , you can pile many more empty containers onto one shipment , and that 's better for the environment . " however , cargoshell containers are currently three times more expensive to manufacture than their steel equivalents , raising doubts that shipping operators will be willing to make the initial investment in order to green their business . " i think the product has potential , but if the price is too high , then it raises questions about getting it onto the market , " said sander sprengers , a general manager at cma cgm , the world 's third-biggest container shipping group . price barrier a concern " another concern is that the maintenance and repair costs may also be high , and that the extra handling costs for the manpower needed to fold the containers up and down could be higher than today 's type of operation , " sprengers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completely folded , a cargoshell container can lie flat houtman said his company is aware of the concerns but added they would be minimized if cargoshell containers were to go into large-scale production .
shipping operators should also bear long-term savings in mind , he added . " if you look at the total transporter chain , the cost-saving potential is tremendous , " houtman said .
" a single ship might go from china to rotterdam with 8,000 containers .
our containers weigh 400 kilograms less than metal ones , so in one transport , you get fuel savings of 526,000 euros , not to mention the co2 savings . " cargoshell containers offer a further benefit : they enable the use of radio signals to track the containers ' progress , something that is currently difficult to do with the steel model . " composite is radio neutral - we can track and trace each container from all over the world , " said houtman .
" we can be informed of the status of each container , whether it 's open or closed , what the inside temperature is .
all of this information can be sent to the company . " developers say the cargoshell containers will have a lifespan of 90 years , but it 's the next decade that they 're focusing on at the moment .
the design needs to pass a series of international standard tests to make sure it has the strength and durability of the conventional steel containers .
the results should be known later this year . company hoping for four percent share if it gets the green light , cargoshell hopes to have a million containers in use by 2020 , taking a 4 percent share of the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shipping operators are used to working with steel containers " i think four percent is quite a lot , " said bart kuipers , an economist based at rotterdam 's erasmus university .
" much depends on how serious the shipping companies are about making their operations greener . " kuipers thinks there might be other niche markets for the foldable containers - in the aid and military logistics markets , for example . " think of the problems with a country like afghanistan , which has no ports , and very difficult roads across mountain landscape , " kuipers said .
" i think cargoshell is a very attractive proposition for these kinds of niche markets . " cargoshell launched its revolutionary containers eight months ago , but the first batch of foldable containers has yet to be produced .
still , houtman is encouraged by the initial backing he 's received from major shipping companies , and a high degree of interest in the product from around the world . " we know that some countries , such as australia and belgium , are very interested in the product , and we have received lots of queries from china and india , " houtman said . author : dave goodman -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an international un effort in the 1990s there failed .
in 2007 , neighboring ethiopia invaded - with backing by the united states - but could n't bring about the desired stability in somalia , either . since 2009 , a western-backed interim government under moderate islamic politician sheikh sharif ahmed has been struggling to hold on to power in central mogadishu .
it can only do so with the help of 7,000 african union -lrb- au -rrb- soldiers .
large parts of the rest of the country are controlled by al shabab militia . the al qaeda-linked shabab militia allegedly has fighters from afghanistan , pakistan and chechnya in their ranks .
the estimated 7,000 militants are well-armed and supported primarily by neighboring eritrea .
but funding also comes from arab circles who want to push back western influence in the region . this is also a reason why western countries do n't want to leave somalia to its own devices , said georges-marc andre , the european commission 's special envoy for somalia .
there 's too much at stake on the horn of africa , he said .
after all , somalia controlled one of the most significant sea routes in international shipping through its position on the gulf of aden .
but the stability of the entire region could also be threatened by somali backed radical islamists , he said . " clearly the war has been started by somalis , " andre said .
" but they are also victims of those who are looking to use somalia as a platform to destabilize the region , whether you speak of the middle east , the states in the arabian gulf or some african countries such as ethiopia , kenya or uganda . " a humanitarian catastrophe andre coordinates eu aid for the collapsed nation from nairobi in neighboring kenya .
in 2010 alone , the eu has made 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid and state-building efforts in somalia .
when the security situation permits , he travels to mogadishu to get a picture of the current situation in somalia .
but there is nothing for andre to gloss over when it comes to the circumstances in the horn of africa . " when you look at the terrorist attacks , when you look at all those civilians who are being killed - including kids and women - when you see the al shabab actions being carried out by child soldiers , when you look at all of this , obviously the situation is awful , " andre said . the civilian population has to bear the brunt of the chaos .
there are 1.5 million internally displaced persons in somalia .
but it is virtually impossible to get humanitarian help to those in need , as the shabab prevent western aid organizations from accessing regions they control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has had no central government since siad barre was overthrown in 1991 " if you look at the needs in the al shabab controlled areas , you will see a very patchy distribution with some dark places where nobody today is about to deliver healthcare , water or nutrition for the children , " said philippe royan , head of the somalia office of the european commission humanitarian aid department . in addition , humanitarian workers are " not welcome " to monitor and assess the population 's needs , royan said . crucial african union support according to experts , the interim government in mogadishu supported by the west would collapse within a few days if it was not protected by the 7,000 au soldiers .
but their deployment since 2007 has only progressed sluggishly .
the au 's contingent still has n't reached its required strength , said wafula wamunyinyi , the deputy special representative from the au commission for somalia . he said the deployment in somalia was supposed to take place in phases .
the first phase was mogadishu . " then after securing mogadishu , where the government would then operate , the next phase was to extend to the countryside , of course with an increased number of troops , and other parts of the country , " wamunyinyi said .
" we are quite on track .
it 's just that there has been some delay due to the slow pace at which countries have deployed their troops . " an investment in the future eu countries finance the au mission in somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- indirectly , for example by training 2,000 somali soldiers in uganda .
for special envoy andre , helping to rebuild somalia is an investment in the future .
after all , western nations ' security was also dependent on the african country 's stability , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers belonging to islamist militias are patrolling mogadishu " if your neighbors like the somalis are in trouble , you have to be worried about peace in europe , " he said .
" what we have to invest now is nothing compared to what we would have to invest in the future if we do n't do something to stabilize and bring back peace in somalia . " according to andre , the impact piracy has had on world trade was a prime example of where somalia was heading .
somali pirates were responsible for 44 percent of the 289 piracy incidents on the world 's seas in the first nine months of 2010 , according to a report published by the international maritime bureau . " that is the reason why we should invest now in somalia , now that time is still there to do something positive with reasonable means , " andre said . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is virtually impossible to get humanitarian help to those in need , as the shabab prevent western aid organizations from accessing regions they control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has had no central government since siad barre was overthrown in 1991 " if you look at the needs in the al shabab controlled areas , you will see a very patchy distribution with some dark places where nobody today is about to deliver healthcare , water or nutrition for the children , " said philippe royan , head of the somalia office of the european commission humanitarian aid department . in addition , humanitarian workers are " not welcome " to monitor and assess the population 's needs , royan said . crucial african union support according to experts , the interim government in mogadishu supported by the west would collapse within a few days if it was not protected by the 7,000 au soldiers .
but their deployment since 2007 has only progressed sluggishly .
the au 's contingent still has n't reached its required strength , said wafula wamunyinyi , the deputy special representative from the au commission for somalia . he said the deployment in somalia was supposed to take place in phases .
the first phase was mogadishu . " then after securing mogadishu , where the government would then operate , the next phase was to extend to the countryside , of course with an increased number of troops , and other parts of the country , " wamunyinyi said .
" we are quite on track .
it 's just that there has been some delay due to the slow pace at which countries have deployed their troops . " an investment in the future eu countries finance the au mission in somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- indirectly , for example by training 2,000 somali soldiers in uganda .
for special envoy andre , helping to rebuild somalia is an investment in the future .
after all , western nations ' security was also dependent on the african country 's stability , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers belonging to islamist militias are patrolling mogadishu " if your neighbors like the somalis are in trouble , you have to be worried about peace in europe , " he said .
" what we have to invest now is nothing compared to what we would have to invest in the future if we do n't do something to stabilize and bring back peace in somalia . " according to andre , the impact piracy has had on world trade was a prime example of where somalia was heading .
somali pirates were responsible for 44 percent of the 289 piracy incidents on the world 's seas in the first nine months of 2010 , according to a report published by the international maritime bureau . " that is the reason why we should invest now in somalia , now that time is still there to do something positive with reasonable means , " andre said . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .
military bases in germany will be reduced in size and , in many cases , shut down completely . for the communities where these bases are located , this is grounds for real concern .
in augustdorf , where germany 's largest base is located , a closure would devastate the town .
close to half of its inhabitants live there only because the base is located there . town dependent on military even before entering augustdorf , one has a pretty clear sense that this is bundeswehr country ; here , street signs not only direct the traffic of cars , but also tanks . the dampened sound of gunfire in the distance is the auditory clue that the military is home to this little town on the outskirts of the teutoburg forest - incidentally the site of the ninth century battle of the same name , which is regarded as one of the decisive battles for germanic tribes in their prevention of roman expansion into northern europe . for over 50 years , troops have been stationed and trained at the generalfeldmarschall rommel military base in augustdorf , which currently accounts for 4,000 of the community 's 9,000 people . mayor andreas wulf openly admits that his town lives with - and from - the military base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wulf wo n't lie : his town needs the military base " the bundeswehr , even without the soldiers , is our largest employer and the biggest provider of training , " says wulf as he looks out the window of his city hall office onto the complex in the distance . " the soldiers themselves , they provide augustdorf with over three million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- in revenue through their private purchases alone . " wulf stresses that the consequences of the military reforms could be social just as well as economic ; the five schools and four kindergartens would have to be reduced if the active soldiers were discharged or displaced . businesses face threat in augustdorf 's tattoo parlor , the great majority of esra pollman 's customers are from the rommel military base . " almost every single one was in afghanistan , " says pollman , whose parlor smells of disinfectant spray , akin to the sterile scent of a regular hospital wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers come to pollman for therapy - and more pain " they come to me , pour their hearts out , and let me subject them to more pain , " jokes pollman , adding that " most want the names of their children , but there are some who want provocative symbols like naked women or weapons .
one time , a soldier wanted the entire map of afghanistan on his back ! " when asked what it would mean if the soldiers left , pollmann retained her optimistic spirit : " i am not scared , but , yeah , if the soldiers are moved elsewhere , i doubt i will have any clients . " across the street , at the town snackbar , elke thiem prepares french fries for three soldiers on lunch break .
for her , the situation is similar ; without the soldiers , she would n't really have a business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke thiem fears she will have less customers in future " from the town baker to my french fry shop , it would be really sad around here , " she replies to the same question asked of pollmann . thiem says she fears that augustdorf could face the same problems faced by other communities where military bases have been closed . " they have real problems there : we do n't want that to happen here . " optimism remains the reforms announced at monday 's military conference are scheduled to begin taking effect during the middle of next year . mayor andreas wulf , who has heard rumors of the rommel base being downsized since before the last structural reform in 2004 , says he wo n't give in to any unspecific fears . " in 2004 , -lsb- defense minister peter struck -rsb- said cuts would be made to the bundeswehr base here , but we appealed to parliament and , in the end , we even succeeded in enlarging our base . " however , despite his optimism , wulf does not appear to be as confident this time around . " we do n't know if augustdorf will be affected by these reforms .
in the end , we certainly ca n't count it out . " author : nicolas martin -lrb- glb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 22.11.2010 indian government embroiled in scandals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proceedings in the lok sabha in new delhi have been disrupted over the past week the indian government has been rocked by a series of corruption scandals linked to the commonwealth games , housing and telecoms , which has significantly dented its image . for over a week now , opposition parties have been blocking the functioning of the indian parliament . they are calling on the government to order an inquiry into one of india 's biggest corruption scandals , which involves the questionable auctioning of telecommunications licenses .
the allocation scam is thought to have cost the government over us $ 35 billion . former telecoms minister a. raja , who was forced to resign earlier this month , is alleged to have issued 2g licenses in january 2008 at prices well below market value .
these frequencies are used to transmit phone calls and text messages to mobile phones . " mr clean 's " reputation at risk the controversy has now engulfed prime minister manmohan singh , whose reputation as " mr clean " is at risk , with the supreme court asking him to explain why mr raja has still not been prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the organizers of the commonwealth games in delhi have been arrested " the role of the prime minister is in question , " explained gurudas dasgupta , an mp from the communist party of india , recalling a similar scandal involving an indian stockbroker who is alleged to have engineered a rise in the bombay stock exchange . " in 1991 when the harshad mehta scam came to light , i raised the matter in the rajya sabha -lrb- upper house of parliament -rrb- , " he says .
" our fingers were raised against the finance ministry .
at that time , the finance minister was manmohan singh .
he agreed to a joint parliamentary committee -lrb- jpc -rrb- , even when his role was being questioned .
today , his role as pm is being questioned . " the telecom scam is just one of the current scandals to haunt the government .
the ruling congress was recently forced to sack ashok chavan , chief minister of the important state of maharashtra , after he and other politicians were found to have colluded to obtain luxury flats that were destined for war widows . before that the government had launched a multiple-agency probe into the commonwealth games after fingers were pointed at the chief organizer suresh kalmadi .
two of his aides have already been arrested by anti-corruption investigators . " if you are not part of the oligarchy , you are out " however , the ruling party is not alone to be embroiled in scandal .
the major opposition bharatiya janata party also faces charges , particularly in the southern state of karnataka , whose chief minister , b s yedyurappa , is currently entangled in a land scam . " corruption has made people prosperous through the shorter route , " deplored kiran bedi , one of india ’ s most-celebrated women police officers and a vocal campaigner against corruption . " there is now a cozy relationship between bureaucrats , corporations and politicians – an oligarchic capitalism of corruption .
if you are not part of this oligarchy , you are out of the system , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian communications and information technology minister a. raja was forced to resign earlier this month prime minister has to show " vision " according to transparency international 's corruption perceptions index for 2010 , india has slipped three places to 87 out of 178 this year . though the scandals pose no immediate threat to singh 's government , they are likely to delay the passage of more reform bills .

the allocation scam is thought to have cost the government over us $ 35 billion . former telecoms minister a. raja , who was forced to resign earlier this month , is alleged to have issued 2g licenses in january 2008 at prices well below market value .
these frequencies are used to transmit phone calls and text messages to mobile phones . " mr clean 's " reputation at risk the controversy has now engulfed prime minister manmohan singh , whose reputation as " mr clean " is at risk , with the supreme court asking him to explain why mr raja has still not been prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the organizers of the commonwealth games in delhi have been arrested " the role of the prime minister is in question , " explained gurudas dasgupta , an mp from the communist party of india , recalling a similar scandal involving an indian stockbroker who is alleged to have engineered a rise in the bombay stock exchange . " in 1991 when the harshad mehta scam came to light , i raised the matter in the rajya sabha -lrb- upper house of parliament -rrb- , " he says .
" our fingers were raised against the finance ministry .
at that time , the finance minister was manmohan singh .
he agreed to a joint parliamentary committee -lrb- jpc -rrb- , even when his role was being questioned .
today , his role as pm is being questioned . " the telecom scam is just one of the current scandals to haunt the government .
the ruling congress was recently forced to sack ashok chavan , chief minister of the important state of maharashtra , after he and other politicians were found to have colluded to obtain luxury flats that were destined for war widows . before that the government had launched a multiple-agency probe into the commonwealth games after fingers were pointed at the chief organizer suresh kalmadi .
two of his aides have already been arrested by anti-corruption investigators . " if you are not part of the oligarchy , you are out " however , the ruling party is not alone to be embroiled in scandal .
the major opposition bharatiya janata party also faces charges , particularly in the southern state of karnataka , whose chief minister , b s yedyurappa , is currently entangled in a land scam . " corruption has made people prosperous through the shorter route , " deplored kiran bedi , one of india ’ s most-celebrated women police officers and a vocal campaigner against corruption . " there is now a cozy relationship between bureaucrats , corporations and politicians – an oligarchic capitalism of corruption .
if you are not part of this oligarchy , you are out of the system , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian communications and information technology minister a. raja was forced to resign earlier this month prime minister has to show " vision " according to transparency international 's corruption perceptions index for 2010 , india has slipped three places to 87 out of 178 this year . though the scandals pose no immediate threat to singh 's government , they are likely to delay the passage of more reform bills . " this is going to continue because the opportunities in india are going to increase , " warned analyst samar harlankar . " in the last 20 years , the receipts to government have grown by more than 10 .
our economy is going to grow and the opportunities are always going to be there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 22.11.2010 german base village fears effects of military reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of augustdorf lives here : the rommel military base the german government is set downsize its military by close to 100,000 soldiers .
the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .
military bases in germany will be reduced in size and , in many cases , shut down completely . for the communities where these bases are located , this is grounds for real concern .
in augustdorf , where germany 's largest base is located , a closure would devastate the town .
close to half of its inhabitants live there only because the base is located there . town dependent on military even before entering augustdorf , one has a pretty clear sense that this is bundeswehr country ; here , street signs not only direct the traffic of cars , but also tanks . the dampened sound of gunfire in the distance is the auditory clue that the military is home to this little town on the outskirts of the teutoburg forest - incidentally the site of the ninth century battle of the same name , which is regarded as one of the decisive battles for germanic tribes in their prevention of roman expansion into northern europe . for over 50 years , troops have been stationed and trained at the generalfeldmarschall rommel military base in augustdorf , which currently accounts for 4,000 of the community 's 9,000 people . mayor andreas wulf openly admits that his town lives with - and from - the military base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wulf wo n't lie : his town needs the military base " the bundeswehr , even without the soldiers , is our largest employer and the biggest provider of training , " says wulf as he looks out the window of his city hall office onto the complex in the distance . " the soldiers themselves , they provide augustdorf with over three million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- in revenue through their private purchases alone . " wulf stresses that the consequences of the military reforms could be social just as well as economic ; the five schools and four kindergartens would have to be reduced if the active soldiers were discharged or displaced . businesses face threat in augustdorf 's tattoo parlor , the great majority of esra pollman 's customers are from the rommel military base . " almost every single one was in afghanistan , " says pollman , whose parlor smells of disinfectant spray , akin to the sterile scent of a regular hospital wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers come to pollman for therapy - and more pain " they come to me , pour their hearts out , and let me subject them to more pain , " jokes pollman , adding that " most want the names of their children , but there are some who want provocative symbols like naked women or weapons .
one time , a soldier wanted the entire map of afghanistan on his back ! " when asked what it would mean if the soldiers left , pollmann retained her optimistic spirit : " i am not scared , but , yeah , if the soldiers are moved elsewhere , i doubt i will have any clients . " across the street , at the town snackbar , elke thiem prepares french fries for three soldiers on lunch break .
for her , the situation is similar ; without the soldiers , she would n't really have a business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke thiem fears she will have less customers in future " from the town baker to my french fry shop , it would be really sad around here , " she replies to the same question asked of pollmann . thiem says she fears that augustdorf could face the same problems faced by other communities where military bases have been closed . " they have real problems there : we do n't want that to happen here . " optimism remains the reforms announced at monday 's military conference are scheduled to begin taking effect during the middle of next year . mayor andreas wulf , who has heard rumors of the rommel base being downsized since before the last structural reform in 2004 , says he wo n't give in to any unspecific fears . " in 2004 , -lsb- defense minister peter struck -rsb- said cuts would be made to the bundeswehr base here , but we appealed to parliament and , in the end , we even succeeded in enlarging our base . " however , despite his optimism , wulf does not appear to be as confident this time around . " we do n't know if augustdorf will be affected by these reforms .
in the end , we certainly ca n't count it out . " author : nicolas martin -lrb- glb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.11.2010 does germany need color-coded security ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : battening down the hatches at the reichstag experts disagree on the merits of terror alert levels as germany steps up security over concerns of a possible islamist attack .
the country does not have a warning system like those in the uk and the us . one of germany 's most popular tourist attractions , the glass dome of the reichstag in berlin , was closed to tourists on monday following media reports of a plot by islamist extremists to attack the german parliament building .
in several incidents across germany these past days , police cordoned off abandoned packages after what turned out to be false alarms .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel moved to reassure the population , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that security forces were doing everything in their power to protect the country , just days after the interior minister announced there was a " new security situation " in germany .
it is high time authorities started considering adopting a system of terror warning levels in germany , philipp holtmann , a terrorism expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- told deutsche welle .
code red ? " if we look at the situation we are confronted with right now , we are on the borderline between panicking and hysteria -lsb- on the one hand -rsb- and absolute negligence of the situation -lsb- on the other -rsb- ; people do not know how to estimate the threat that really exists , " he said .
terror alert levels would make it much easier for the population to deal with the threats , holtmann said , because there would be more clarity than there is now : " every hour , we have new reports in the media that give us different scenarios , that tell us different confusing and often contradicting facts , and it would be much easier for the population if there was a clear terror warning alert system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go about your daily life , experts say people can not prevent terrorism , holtmann said , but according to a warning system , people could raise or lower their awareness for things going on around them .
they should continue to keep on living their normal lives but be more alert : " there is no recipe how to do this .
it is not this bag or this person , this language or this culture that needs to be watched , it 's a general awareness , " he said .
in the us , the homeland security advisory system codes threat levels from yellow , or elevated , to red , or severe and accordingly issues warnings to the public .
britain has a system of five threat levels ranging from low to critical .
disagreement over step-by-step warning systems george kassimeris , a senior research fellow in conflict and terrorism at the university of wolverhampton in the uk , said germany would be ill-advised in following the british and us terror alert example .
the systems made sense in theory , he told deutsche welle , but in practice they could be counterproductive : " with all these different levels and colors , the end result is a certain degree of panic , confusion and anxiety among the population because the population are not in possession of the knowledge and information the intelligence services are when they issue all these different warnings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the police prepared ?
the intelligence services , the british expert said , would never notify the public in advance of an imminent terror threat because if they did , they would be giving the game away to the terrorists .
" ordinary people can do absolutely nothing about it " kassimeris said that at first , people heed terror warnings , but at some point , they stop paying attention because they make no difference to their lives .
terrorism has become a part of our lives , kassimeris said , and it is bound to continue to be a part of our lives because there will always be people who resort to violence to advance their fanatical beliefs .
" the population can not possibly be prepared , " according to kassimeris - but the intelligence and security agencies can . the debate should not be about whether the public was prepared , he said , but whether the security services who are responsible for protecting people 's safety are prepared to the very maximum to deal with the threat .

but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .
the sooner australia becomes a republic and finally shakes the shackles of great britain the better for all .
viva la republique de australie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 22.11.2010 german base village fears effects of military reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of augustdorf lives here : the rommel military base the german government is set downsize its military by close to 100,000 soldiers .
the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .
military bases in germany will be reduced in size and , in many cases , shut down completely . for the communities where these bases are located , this is grounds for real concern .
in augustdorf , where germany 's largest base is located , a closure would devastate the town .
close to half of its inhabitants live there only because the base is located there . town dependent on military even before entering augustdorf , one has a pretty clear sense that this is bundeswehr country ; here , street signs not only direct the traffic of cars , but also tanks . the dampened sound of gunfire in the distance is the auditory clue that the military is home to this little town on the outskirts of the teutoburg forest - incidentally the site of the ninth century battle of the same name , which is regarded as one of the decisive battles for germanic tribes in their prevention of roman expansion into northern europe . for over 50 years , troops have been stationed and trained at the generalfeldmarschall rommel military base in augustdorf , which currently accounts for 4,000 of the community 's 9,000 people . mayor andreas wulf openly admits that his town lives with - and from - the military base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wulf wo n't lie : his town needs the military base " the bundeswehr , even without the soldiers , is our largest employer and the biggest provider of training , " says wulf as he looks out the window of his city hall office onto the complex in the distance . " the soldiers themselves , they provide augustdorf with over three million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- in revenue through their private purchases alone . " wulf stresses that the consequences of the military reforms could be social just as well as economic ; the five schools and four kindergartens would have to be reduced if the active soldiers were discharged or displaced . businesses face threat in augustdorf 's tattoo parlor , the great majority of esra pollman 's customers are from the rommel military base . " almost every single one was in afghanistan , " says pollman , whose parlor smells of disinfectant spray , akin to the sterile scent of a regular hospital wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers come to pollman for therapy - and more pain " they come to me , pour their hearts out , and let me subject them to more pain , " jokes pollman , adding that " most want the names of their children , but there are some who want provocative symbols like naked women or weapons .
one time , a soldier wanted the entire map of afghanistan on his back ! " when asked what it would mean if the soldiers left , pollmann retained her optimistic spirit : " i am not scared , but , yeah , if the soldiers are moved elsewhere , i doubt i will have any clients . " across the street , at the town snackbar , elke thiem prepares french fries for three soldiers on lunch break .
for her , the situation is similar ; without the soldiers , she would n't really have a business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke thiem fears she will have less customers in future " from the town baker to my french fry shop , it would be really sad around here , " she replies to the same question asked of pollmann . thiem says she fears that augustdorf could face the same problems faced by other communities where military bases have been closed . " they have real problems there : we do n't want that to happen here . " optimism remains the reforms announced at monday 's military conference are scheduled to begin taking effect during the middle of next year . mayor andreas wulf , who has heard rumors of the rommel base being downsized since before the last structural reform in 2004 , says he wo n't give in to any unspecific fears . " in 2004 , -lsb- defense minister peter struck -rsb- said cuts would be made to the bundeswehr base here , but we appealed to parliament and , in the end , we even succeeded in enlarging our base . " however , despite his optimism , wulf does not appear to be as confident this time around . " we do n't know if augustdorf will be affected by these reforms .
in the end , we certainly ca n't count it out . " author : nicolas martin -lrb- glb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.11.2010 eu agrees bailout for ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland has admitted it needs financial help eu finance ministers have agreed on a bailout fund for ireland to tackle the country 's huge budget deficit and save its banking sector .
it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .
the euro had faced heavy selling recently due to concerns over ireland 's debts ' impact on the economic bloc .

" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .
the euro had faced heavy selling recently due to concerns over ireland 's debts ' impact on the economic bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .

thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.11.2010 reichstag dome closed to public after terror warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reichstag dome is a popular tourist destination amid heightened concern about a possible terror attack on german soil , the glass dome of the country 's parliament has been closed to the public .
politicians warned that some dangers were being overstated . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has said that security agencies are working to prevent a possible terror attack , but he criticized news organizations for their reporting on the threat , saying it was a danger in its own right .
speaking on a german news talk show on sunday evening , de maiziere took pains to distance himself from " irresponsible speculation " about terror threats published by weekly news magazine der spiegel and other news outlets .
after de maiziere had given a terror warning earlier in the week , der spiegel reported that al-qaeda operatives were planning a bloody hostage-taking attack on the reichstag , in berlin , before the end of november .
the reichstag is the seat of german parliament .
on monday , the glassed-in cupola of the reichstag - a favorite tourist destination - was closed to the public , although pre-arranged group tours were still taking place .
closing the reichstag but on sunday , de maiziere warned , " speculation has a psychological effect in itself .
it also spreads fear . "
he assured the public that the government is " taking the threat seriously , without being completely sure " about what the threat is , or when an attack would be expected .
the government 's terror warning on wednesday was reportedly based on internal sources .
der spiegel cited a jihadist who contacted the german authorities , as well as data from foreign intelligence sources , including the fbi .
the interior ministry has not issued denials on the sources of the reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere has said the security forces can not guarantee absolute safety other conservative politicians jumped on the message of warning against spreading panic over the terror threats as well .
on sunday , christian democrat home affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told the bild newspaper that : " we need the right balance between alertness and calm , and we should n't change our daily lives . "
he said the likelihood of having a traffic accident was higher than of being the victim of a terror attack , adding " nonetheless i get into my car , a bus or a train every day . "
increased security measures for his part , de maiziere told moderator will that there was " no answer to how we have to act so as to completely avoid terrorism , " nor was there any point in trying to placate terrorists .
" if we do what terrorists tell us - like immediately withdraw from afghanistan , or introduce sharia law in germany , … even that might not stop them .
we have to behave how we see fit . "
de maiziere 's warning on wednesday led to increased security at airports and train stations across germany .
for the few weeks prior to the alert , he had repeatedly played down a number of reports and warnings from the us about possible terrorist assaults in europe .
germany has not been hit by a major islamist terror attack in the past decade , although there have been a number of planned attacks which were prevented or which failed .
but german troops ' engagement in afghanistan has brought the country closer to the attention of islamic radicals . but now , german police say , the danger of an islamist terrorist attack in germany has never been more specific .
the head of the german police force , matthias seeger , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper that there have been a number of tip-offs from different sources .
on tuesday , a parliamentary committee will be holding a special session to discuss the current threat level , christian democrat lawmaker stefan mueller told dpa news agency .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .

but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 22.11.2010 german base village fears effects of military reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of augustdorf lives here : the rommel military base the german government is set downsize its military by close to 100,000 soldiers .
the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .
military bases in germany will be reduced in size and , in many cases , shut down completely . for the communities where these bases are located , this is grounds for real concern .
in augustdorf , where germany 's largest base is located , a closure would devastate the town .
close to half of its inhabitants live there only because the base is located there . town dependent on military even before entering augustdorf , one has a pretty clear sense that this is bundeswehr country ; here , street signs not only direct the traffic of cars , but also tanks . the dampened sound of gunfire in the distance is the auditory clue that the military is home to this little town on the outskirts of the teutoburg forest - incidentally the site of the ninth century battle of the same name , which is regarded as one of the decisive battles for germanic tribes in their prevention of roman expansion into northern europe . for over 50 years , troops have been stationed and trained at the generalfeldmarschall rommel military base in augustdorf , which currently accounts for 4,000 of the community 's 9,000 people . mayor andreas wulf openly admits that his town lives with - and from - the military base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wulf wo n't lie : his town needs the military base " the bundeswehr , even without the soldiers , is our largest employer and the biggest provider of training , " says wulf as he looks out the window of his city hall office onto the complex in the distance . " the soldiers themselves , they provide augustdorf with over three million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- in revenue through their private purchases alone . " wulf stresses that the consequences of the military reforms could be social just as well as economic ; the five schools and four kindergartens would have to be reduced if the active soldiers were discharged or displaced . businesses face threat in augustdorf 's tattoo parlor , the great majority of esra pollman 's customers are from the rommel military base . " almost every single one was in afghanistan , " says pollman , whose parlor smells of disinfectant spray , akin to the sterile scent of a regular hospital wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers come to pollman for therapy - and more pain " they come to me , pour their hearts out , and let me subject them to more pain , " jokes pollman , adding that " most want the names of their children , but there are some who want provocative symbols like naked women or weapons .
one time , a soldier wanted the entire map of afghanistan on his back ! " when asked what it would mean if the soldiers left , pollmann retained her optimistic spirit : " i am not scared , but , yeah , if the soldiers are moved elsewhere , i doubt i will have any clients . " across the street , at the town snackbar , elke thiem prepares french fries for three soldiers on lunch break .
for her , the situation is similar ; without the soldiers , she would n't really have a business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke thiem fears she will have less customers in future " from the town baker to my french fry shop , it would be really sad around here , " she replies to the same question asked of pollmann . thiem says she fears that augustdorf could face the same problems faced by other communities where military bases have been closed . " they have real problems there : we do n't want that to happen here . " optimism remains the reforms announced at monday 's military conference are scheduled to begin taking effect during the middle of next year . mayor andreas wulf , who has heard rumors of the rommel base being downsized since before the last structural reform in 2004 , says he wo n't give in to any unspecific fears . " in 2004 , -lsb- defense minister peter struck -rsb- said cuts would be made to the bundeswehr base here , but we appealed to parliament and , in the end , we even succeeded in enlarging our base . " however , despite his optimism , wulf does not appear to be as confident this time around . " we do n't know if augustdorf will be affected by these reforms .
in the end , we certainly ca n't count it out . " author : nicolas martin -lrb- glb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .

politicians warned that some dangers were being overstated . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has said that security agencies are working to prevent a possible terror attack , but he criticized news organizations for their reporting on the threat , saying it was a danger in its own right .
speaking on a german news talk show on sunday evening , de maiziere took pains to distance himself from " irresponsible speculation " about terror threats published by weekly news magazine der spiegel and other news outlets .
after de maiziere had given a terror warning earlier in the week , der spiegel reported that al-qaeda operatives were planning a bloody hostage-taking attack on the reichstag , in berlin , before the end of november .
the reichstag is the seat of german parliament .
on monday , the glassed-in cupola of the reichstag - a favorite tourist destination - was closed to the public , although pre-arranged group tours were still taking place .
closing the reichstag but on sunday , de maiziere warned , " speculation has a psychological effect in itself .
it also spreads fear . "
he assured the public that the government is " taking the threat seriously , without being completely sure " about what the threat is , or when an attack would be expected .
the government 's terror warning on wednesday was reportedly based on internal sources .
der spiegel cited a jihadist who contacted the german authorities , as well as data from foreign intelligence sources , including the fbi .
the interior ministry has not issued denials on the sources of the reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere has said the security forces can not guarantee absolute safety other conservative politicians jumped on the message of warning against spreading panic over the terror threats as well .
on sunday , christian democrat home affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told the bild newspaper that : " we need the right balance between alertness and calm , and we should n't change our daily lives . "
he said the likelihood of having a traffic accident was higher than of being the victim of a terror attack , adding " nonetheless i get into my car , a bus or a train every day . "
increased security measures for his part , de maiziere told moderator will that there was " no answer to how we have to act so as to completely avoid terrorism , " nor was there any point in trying to placate terrorists .
" if we do what terrorists tell us - like immediately withdraw from afghanistan , or introduce sharia law in germany , … even that might not stop them .
we have to behave how we see fit . "
de maiziere 's warning on wednesday led to increased security at airports and train stations across germany .
for the few weeks prior to the alert , he had repeatedly played down a number of reports and warnings from the us about possible terrorist assaults in europe .
germany has not been hit by a major islamist terror attack in the past decade , although there have been a number of planned attacks which were prevented or which failed .
but german troops ' engagement in afghanistan has brought the country closer to the attention of islamic radicals . but now , german police say , the danger of an islamist terrorist attack in germany has never been more specific .
the head of the german police force , matthias seeger , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper that there have been a number of tip-offs from different sources .
on tuesday , a parliamentary committee will be holding a special session to discuss the current threat level , christian democrat lawmaker stefan mueller told dpa news agency .

'
limited background information on the pirates could hamper the case . the first pirate trial to take place in germany in 400 years has opened in hamburg .
more than seven months after the attack on the hamburg-registered container ship ms taipan , 10 somali men are standing trial .
they are charged with attacking the ship some 900 kilometers -lrb- 560 miles -rrb- east of the somali coast in april .
one of the defendants has told the court that he was 13 years old at the time of the attack , which would mean he could not be tried under german law .
experts in the court believe he is likely 15 or older ; however , with little reliable documentation on the youngster , this could be difficult to prove .
" a child should not be obliged to stand in court , if his given age of 13 is correct , " the chair of the judging panel , bernd steinmetz said .
the eldest accused said he was 48 , while the other eight all stated ages between 16 and 28 ; but none of them could give his precise date of birth .
the accused have been communicating via interpreters , as they do n't speak german .
possible sentences between 10 and 15 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taipan was freed by dutch marines nobody was injured when the taipan vessel was taken hostage in april .
the ship 's 15-man crew fled to a safety room when the pirates boarded their ship , and the pirates were eventually captured by dutch naval forces .
the alleged pirates were extradited to germany in june .
since then , they have been in custody awaiting trial .
the defendants could get sentences of anywhere from 10 to 15 years in prison if found guilty .
the prosecution says it has evidence that the men were in possession of kalashnikov rifles , grenade launchers , knives and ladders for boarding ships .
the team of 20 defense lawyers jointly appealed to the court to consider the circumstances in somalia , an all-but lawless country racked by two decades of civil war , where they said life was marked by hunger , terror and a lack of medicine .
" the somali people are suffering ; there is no possibility of fleeing within the country , " the lawyers argued .
piracy is a growing problem off the coast of somalia , with both the number of attacks and the ransoms demanded spiking over the past two years , the london-based international maritime bureau told afp news service .
some 23 vessels and 500 crew are currently held by somali pirates , the bureau said .

but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else . " meanwhile , google remains under investigation in germany , spain , italy , canada and the us . author : cyrus farivar editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.11.2010 eu agrees bailout for ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland has admitted it needs financial help eu finance ministers have agreed on a bailout fund for ireland to tackle the country 's huge budget deficit and save its banking sector .
it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .
the euro had faced heavy selling recently due to concerns over ireland 's debts ' impact on the economic bloc .

the mini-aircraft is powered through a focused laser pointed at the uav , rather than relying solely on batteries . unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs have long been used by the military for applications ranging from reconnaissance and surveillance to armed attacks .
while larger uavs are powered in the same way as conventional aircraft , small uavs - under five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- - are battery powered , which generally limits flight time to 20 to 45 minutes .
however , german and american research teams have been working hard to overcome the shortcomings of battery-life and recently set a world record earlier this month at 12 hours , 26 minutes and 56.9 seconds .
the asctec pelican is a small quadrocopter developed by ascending technologies , a young german company based just outside of munich .
the pelican weighs less than a kilogram and is less than 45 cm across -lrb- almost 18 inches -rrb- .
ascending technologies teamed up with lasermotive , an american research company that specializes in laser power technology , and was the winner of the 2009 nasa-sponsored power beaming competition .
in their reach for the holy grail of unlimited power for uavs , researchers fitted solar cells to the underside of the asctec pelican .
when hit by the laser , which can reach up to one kilometer , these cells convert the beam into electrical power and continuously charge the battery .
conceivably , this uav could stay aloft forever , given unlimited laser power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael achtelik is the ceo of ascending technologies , the company behind the asctec pelican the asctec pelican 's battery lasts for 20 minutes , so for it to fly for over 12 hours is a major breakthrough , said michael achtelik , the ceo of ascending technologies , in an interview with deutsche welle .
an order of magnitude greater law enforcement experts also are impressed by the new uav 's hover , or loiter , time .
" a uav that has a 12 hour loiter time , its right off the charts right now , ” said charles " sid " heal , a technology consultant and technology chairman for the national tactical officers association in the united states .
heal is also a former commander in the los angeles county sheriffs department .
" to give you an example , the best hover uav that we have in the united states right now , even under the most ideal conditions , would have a loiter time less than one hour .
so they 've increased the loiter time by one order of magnitude . "
beyond law enforcement officials , others in the scientific community say that this new approach shows promise .
" it shows how much energy can be transferred via this laser powered system , since the quadrocopter system needs about three times more energy than a conventional fixed wing uav , " said gordon strickert , a research scientist at the german aerospace center in braunschweig .
" it also shows that such a quadrocoptor system can be flown very precisely and can hold its position accurately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new uav record is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently available in the united states restricted use of uavs in the united states uav 's are currently not authorized for use in law enforcement in the united states , much to heal 's chagrin .
he said this kind of breakthrough could make a real difference in law enforcement in the united states , where he worked swat for many years .
" some of our incidents were in high-rise buildings , " he said , noting that uavs have particular advantages over helicopters , in that they 're significantly cheaper , quieter and much less visible .
" one of the most vulnerable places is the windows , but yet we ca n't see in the windows .
we could actually take a uav and park it up 20 stories and literally look right in the window as if we were standing on the ground . "
drawbacks of laser power despite the new hover record , the laser power has its flaws , too , noted strickert .
" you need a powerful laser and a tracking system and a power supply on the ground , ” he said .
strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else . " meanwhile , google remains under investigation in germany , spain , italy , canada and the us . author : cyrus farivar editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he contemplates on how the pilgrimage to mecca has changed his picture of saudi arabia - and talks about his conversations with foreign workers in the country . i 'm sitting among hundreds of thousands of exhausted pilgrims at jeddah airport and i know : it 's all over now .
goodbye to mecca !
thanks for having me .
and i also want to thank all the dw users who cast a critical eye on my journey and posted numerous questions .
your feedback has been a real incitement to my work - and it 's been a lot of fun .
i 'm proud that i was able to reach muslims as well as non-muslims with my diary entries .
by the way , not all of the pilgrims are going home now .
some go on to spend a vacation here , if they can afford it .
many of them stroll along the beaches of the red sea with dark sunglasses .
the hotels are still booked-out .
however , i 'm sitting here at the airport among the many other " flying pilgrims . "
in fact , the rush of people is so heavy that we were asked to be here six hours before departure time .
ex-pilgrims with sunglasses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims at a hotel in jeddah prior to my journey to mecca , i had n't personally met a saudi in my whole life .
i was only familiar with the common prejudices that other arabs like to tell each other about saudis - particularly in yemen , the extremely poor country i come from .
from a yemeni perspective , they easily seem like spoiled " brothers " from a rich neighboring country .
and while saudi arabia has close ties with western countries , it also applies a particularly conservative islamic rule - including whippings and death penalties for violations of the sharia .
my visit was too short to question or change this picture fundamentally .
however , i made some diverging observations that might help to better differentiate between the country 's people and the existing system of government .
all of the saudis that i met in the past days were very friendly - and they were open-minded as well .
let 's take the young men working for the hajj 's organizing committee : all of them had been to college , many of them in foreign countries .
and they all spoke at least three foreign languages .
they love to have fun a lot and spice up their working days with jokes .
at the same time , they 're proud muslims who are very sensitive about utterances associating islam directly or indirectly with extremism or terrorism .
" we utterly reject that , " they say .
" we 're tolerant and open-minded toward non-muslims as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating with multilingual saudi employees of the pilgrim 's office i personally had the feeling that they really meant what they said , and that they were n't just saying it to me because i 'm a journalist from a foreign media company .
however , what about the government 's policies ?
there are a number of facts that can hardly be conveyed to a foreign audience , such as the ban of christian symbols or the exclusion of women from the general public .
what is more , foreigners coming into the country need a saudi resident acting as a guarantor for them .
muhammad is fluent in korean muhammad works for the pilgrimage 's information office as well .
he studied in south korea for five years , where he lived only among locals - he 's fluent in the language .
he still raves about the time in the far east : " koreans are very kind and caring people .
they virtually love foreigners . "
i get the feeling that muhammad was really well-integrated over there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of jiddah these are the moments when you 're sitting in mecca and you 're suddenly reminded of the integration debate going on in germany .
i ask myself : is language really that important when it comes to integration ?
i wonder about that ever since i met bikhiit , a plumber who was hired by a saudi prince only for the days of the hajj .
bikhiit worked on the prince 's luxurious pilgrim 's tent in mecca .
the prince and the plumber bikhiit is from egypt .
aside from his different accent , he 's probably as good in arabic as the saudi prince .
every year , he makes sure that the prince 's pilgrim 's tent is provided with constant warm water .
the sanitary engineer has been working in saudi arabia for 16 years now - but he does n't have a single saudi friend .
" i only consort with saudis during work , " he says .
" i spend the little time off that i have in the evening with my egyptian friends in coffeehouses or watching soccer . "
when i ask him why he 's got no private contacts to locals , he replies : " for example , we egyptians have our own eating habits . "
that 's all i get from him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikhiit , the plumber of the prince however , he 's very proud of the plumbing job for the saudi prince .
and he 's very grateful to his " normal " saudi employer who allows him to work here during the hajj .
bikhiit likes to live in saudi arabia because he earns more money than in egypt .
but there 's a price to pay for that : he had to give his passport to his employer - as law dictates .
human rights activists argue that this practice establishes a situation of complete dependency .
bikhiit says : " well , at least the passport wo n't get lost . "
his family lives in egypt .
he visits them once a year .
a nepalese in a five star hotel bahadur is a guest worker as well .
he 's from nepal .
the 23-year-old prepares the rooms of a five star hotel and cleans the sanitary installations used by rich pilgrims during the hajj .
" i 'm very happy with the money i make here , " he says .
however , he 's not about to integrate into saudi society .
and nobody has ever asked him to do so , either .
even though the percentage of foreigners living in the kingdom is higher than in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahadur from nepal works in a five star hotel in jeddah i ask a saudi : " is it a problem that few guest workers here speak arabic ? "
" no , " he says - and he obviously does n't quite understand why i would ask him about the language skills of inexpensive foreign workers .
" as long as guest workers do n't consort with people here , that 's not a problem .
besides , many saudis do n't speak english ! "
integration not wanted one of the last people i meet in saudi arabia is faisal , a cab driver from pakistan who takes me to the airport .
i compliment him on his good arabic - but that does n't help him to become socially integrated or to receive a permanent right of residence .
" in the united states and in australia you can become a citizen after five years , " he raves - maybe oversimplifying it a bit .
" but you need to legally live and work in saudi arabia for 20 years in order to get a saudi passport . "
that 's also part of saudi reality : once a guest worker , always a guest worker .
when we part , faisal asks me : " do you have a german passport ? "
" no , " i tell him .
" it 's not that easy to get one .
you first have to legally work and live in germany for 8 years .
there are naturalization tests and you need to have sufficient german language skills .
faisal smiles and i smile back : " at any rate , it 's a lot easier than in saudi arabia . "

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .
the sooner australia becomes a republic and finally shakes the shackles of great britain the better for all .
viva la republique de australie .
i dream of a new day i do . - stuart , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else . " meanwhile , google remains under investigation in germany , spain , italy , canada and the us . author : cyrus farivar editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 22.11.2010 war crimes trial of congo 's former vice president begins in the hague großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-pierre bemba , right , faces multiple charges at the icc the trial of former congolese rebel leader jean-pierre bemba has begun at the international criminal court .
he 's accused of war crimes committed seven years ago in the central african republic but has denied all charges . in july 2006 , during the election in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- , jean-pierre bemba seemed poised to become the country 's next president .
it did n't happen .
his opponent , joseph kabila , won the vote .
about a year later bemba fled to portugal after clashes between his bodyguards and soldiers loyal to kabila .
in may 2008 , he was arrested by belgian police and two months later he was in a prison not far from the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
on monday , the former vice president of congo , a rebel leader and leader of congo 's main opposition party stood before judges at the icc , charged with three counts of war crimes and two counts of crimes against humanity for murder , rape and pillage allegedly committed by his movement for the liberation of congo -lrb- mlc -rrb- rebel forces in the central african republic from october 2002 to march 2003 . mlc soldiers had been invited into the central african republic by then-president ange-felix patasse to help put down a coup .
the coup leader , former army chief francois bozize , overthrew patasse and in 2004 called in the icc to investigate .
according to the lawyer for the victims of bemba 's alleged crimes , monday is a very important day .
" even if it can never make up for the harm done , the victims need to know the truth and have the possibility to tell their stories , " said marie-edith lawson of the association of women lawyers in the central african republic .
" the culprits must be punished .
that would give at least some moral satisfaction to the victims . "
local leader at fault , supporters say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bemba during happier days before congolese elections in 2006 but supporters of bemba say the drc senator and wealthy businessman is not guilty of the charges brought against him .
even if bemba was the leader of the mlc , he did n't have anything to do with atrocities committed in the central african republic .
according to bemba 's lawyer , aime kilolo , it needs to be clarified who was the real military leader involved - not of the mcl overall , but from the contingent stationed in bangui in the period during which the alleged crimes took place .
" our position is clear : the central african government asked the mlc for soldiers and these men were made available to a sovereign state , " said kilolo .
" therefore it is not possible to say that jean-pierre bemba was the local leader . "
bemba 's lawyers have repeatedly submitted petitions to get the case dismissed .
responsible as leader but to prosecutors and joint plaintiffs , bemba 's location during the atrocities is not the deciding factor in determining his innocence or guilt .
lawson says that just because bemba was not at the location where the atrocities took place does not mean that he did not know about them .
he could have just as well given orders from afar , she says .
it 's this aspect of the case that makes it so unusual .
to win their case , prosecutors must prove that those committing the crimes were bemba 's subordinates , that he had knowledge of the crimes and that he constantly failed to act or punish those crimes .
" this is the first trail in which someone must take responsibility as a military leader and not as a perpetrator or accomplice , " said fadil abdallah , the legal outreach officer at the icc .
" the international criminal court is thereby sending a strong signal that there is no immunity from prosecution for someone who holds political or administrative responsibility in his country . "
bildunterschrift : prosecutors at the icc must prove bemba 's subordinates committed the crimes big trial , big challenges but experts have said a case like this can be tough to prove .
the trial is expected to last several months .
the court has accepted 135 victims as participants in this trial and at least 37 are expected to testify .
another 1,200 applications from other victims are under consideration .
preparations have already been going on for more than two years .
besides the legal challenges facing the court , it also has an obligation to communicate often complicated trial proceedings across thousands of miles to populations in two central african countries , where infrastructures are often creaking at best .
in the drc at least , the icc has been accused of failing to communicate with local people , leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings on both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 22.11.2010 opinion : is nato withdrawal from afghanistan by 2014 realistic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato confirmed at its summit in lisbon that it wanted to pull out of afghanistan by the end of 2014 , leaving the afghan security forces in control .
but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else . " meanwhile , google remains under investigation in germany , spain , italy , canada and the us . author : cyrus farivar editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 22.11.2010 deutsche bank goes to vegas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money , money , money makes vegas go round come mid-december , las vegas will be one casino richer and the deutsche bank will have officially planted a large and very expensive foot in the nevada desert .
but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

he contemplates on how the pilgrimage to mecca has changed his picture of saudi arabia - and talks about his conversations with foreign workers in the country . i 'm sitting among hundreds of thousands of exhausted pilgrims at jeddah airport and i know : it 's all over now .
goodbye to mecca !
thanks for having me .
and i also want to thank all the dw users who cast a critical eye on my journey and posted numerous questions .
your feedback has been a real incitement to my work - and it 's been a lot of fun .
i 'm proud that i was able to reach muslims as well as non-muslims with my diary entries .
by the way , not all of the pilgrims are going home now .
some go on to spend a vacation here , if they can afford it .
many of them stroll along the beaches of the red sea with dark sunglasses .
the hotels are still booked-out .
however , i 'm sitting here at the airport among the many other " flying pilgrims . "
in fact , the rush of people is so heavy that we were asked to be here six hours before departure time .
ex-pilgrims with sunglasses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims at a hotel in jeddah prior to my journey to mecca , i had n't personally met a saudi in my whole life .
i was only familiar with the common prejudices that other arabs like to tell each other about saudis - particularly in yemen , the extremely poor country i come from .
from a yemeni perspective , they easily seem like spoiled " brothers " from a rich neighboring country .
and while saudi arabia has close ties with western countries , it also applies a particularly conservative islamic rule - including whippings and death penalties for violations of the sharia .
my visit was too short to question or change this picture fundamentally .
however , i made some diverging observations that might help to better differentiate between the country 's people and the existing system of government .
all of the saudis that i met in the past days were very friendly - and they were open-minded as well .
let 's take the young men working for the hajj 's organizing committee : all of them had been to college , many of them in foreign countries .
and they all spoke at least three foreign languages .
they love to have fun a lot and spice up their working days with jokes .
at the same time , they 're proud muslims who are very sensitive about utterances associating islam directly or indirectly with extremism or terrorism .
" we utterly reject that , " they say .
" we 're tolerant and open-minded toward non-muslims as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating with multilingual saudi employees of the pilgrim 's office i personally had the feeling that they really meant what they said , and that they were n't just saying it to me because i 'm a journalist from a foreign media company .
however , what about the government 's policies ?
there are a number of facts that can hardly be conveyed to a foreign audience , such as the ban of christian symbols or the exclusion of women from the general public .
what is more , foreigners coming into the country need a saudi resident acting as a guarantor for them .
muhammad is fluent in korean muhammad works for the pilgrimage 's information office as well .
he studied in south korea for five years , where he lived only among locals - he 's fluent in the language .
he still raves about the time in the far east : " koreans are very kind and caring people .
they virtually love foreigners . "
i get the feeling that muhammad was really well-integrated over there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of jiddah these are the moments when you 're sitting in mecca and you 're suddenly reminded of the integration debate going on in germany .
i ask myself : is language really that important when it comes to integration ?
i wonder about that ever since i met bikhiit , a plumber who was hired by a saudi prince only for the days of the hajj .
bikhiit worked on the prince 's luxurious pilgrim 's tent in mecca .
the prince and the plumber bikhiit is from egypt .
aside from his different accent , he 's probably as good in arabic as the saudi prince .
every year , he makes sure that the prince 's pilgrim 's tent is provided with constant warm water .
the sanitary engineer has been working in saudi arabia for 16 years now - but he does n't have a single saudi friend .
" i only consort with saudis during work , " he says .
" i spend the little time off that i have in the evening with my egyptian friends in coffeehouses or watching soccer . "
when i ask him why he 's got no private contacts to locals , he replies : " for example , we egyptians have our own eating habits . "
that 's all i get from him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikhiit , the plumber of the prince however , he 's very proud of the plumbing job for the saudi prince .
and he 's very grateful to his " normal " saudi employer who allows him to work here during the hajj .
bikhiit likes to live in saudi arabia because he earns more money than in egypt .
but there 's a price to pay for that : he had to give his passport to his employer - as law dictates .
human rights activists argue that this practice establishes a situation of complete dependency .
bikhiit says : " well , at least the passport wo n't get lost . "
his family lives in egypt .
he visits them once a year .
a nepalese in a five star hotel bahadur is a guest worker as well .
he 's from nepal .
the 23-year-old prepares the rooms of a five star hotel and cleans the sanitary installations used by rich pilgrims during the hajj .
" i 'm very happy with the money i make here , " he says .
however , he 's not about to integrate into saudi society .
and nobody has ever asked him to do so , either .
even though the percentage of foreigners living in the kingdom is higher than in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahadur from nepal works in a five star hotel in jeddah i ask a saudi : " is it a problem that few guest workers here speak arabic ? "
" no , " he says - and he obviously does n't quite understand why i would ask him about the language skills of inexpensive foreign workers .
" as long as guest workers do n't consort with people here , that 's not a problem .
besides , many saudis do n't speak english ! "
integration not wanted one of the last people i meet in saudi arabia is faisal , a cab driver from pakistan who takes me to the airport .
i compliment him on his good arabic - but that does n't help him to become socially integrated or to receive a permanent right of residence .
" in the united states and in australia you can become a citizen after five years , " he raves - maybe oversimplifying it a bit .
" but you need to legally live and work in saudi arabia for 20 years in order to get a saudi passport . "
that 's also part of saudi reality : once a guest worker , always a guest worker .
when we part , faisal asks me : " do you have a german passport ? "
" no , " i tell him .
" it 's not that easy to get one .
you first have to legally work and live in germany for 8 years .
there are naturalization tests and you need to have sufficient german language skills .
faisal smiles and i smile back : " at any rate , it 's a lot easier than in saudi arabia . "

the mini-aircraft is powered through a focused laser pointed at the uav , rather than relying solely on batteries . unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs have long been used by the military for applications ranging from reconnaissance and surveillance to armed attacks .
while larger uavs are powered in the same way as conventional aircraft , small uavs - under five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- - are battery powered , which generally limits flight time to 20 to 45 minutes .
however , german and american research teams have been working hard to overcome the shortcomings of battery-life and recently set a world record earlier this month at 12 hours , 26 minutes and 56.9 seconds .
the asctec pelican is a small quadrocopter developed by ascending technologies , a young german company based just outside of munich .
the pelican weighs less than a kilogram and is less than 45 cm across -lrb- almost 18 inches -rrb- .
ascending technologies teamed up with lasermotive , an american research company that specializes in laser power technology , and was the winner of the 2009 nasa-sponsored power beaming competition .
in their reach for the holy grail of unlimited power for uavs , researchers fitted solar cells to the underside of the asctec pelican .
when hit by the laser , which can reach up to one kilometer , these cells convert the beam into electrical power and continuously charge the battery .
conceivably , this uav could stay aloft forever , given unlimited laser power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael achtelik is the ceo of ascending technologies , the company behind the asctec pelican the asctec pelican 's battery lasts for 20 minutes , so for it to fly for over 12 hours is a major breakthrough , said michael achtelik , the ceo of ascending technologies , in an interview with deutsche welle .
an order of magnitude greater law enforcement experts also are impressed by the new uav 's hover , or loiter , time .
" a uav that has a 12 hour loiter time , its right off the charts right now , ” said charles " sid " heal , a technology consultant and technology chairman for the national tactical officers association in the united states .
heal is also a former commander in the los angeles county sheriffs department .
" to give you an example , the best hover uav that we have in the united states right now , even under the most ideal conditions , would have a loiter time less than one hour .
so they 've increased the loiter time by one order of magnitude . "
beyond law enforcement officials , others in the scientific community say that this new approach shows promise .
" it shows how much energy can be transferred via this laser powered system , since the quadrocopter system needs about three times more energy than a conventional fixed wing uav , " said gordon strickert , a research scientist at the german aerospace center in braunschweig .
" it also shows that such a quadrocoptor system can be flown very precisely and can hold its position accurately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new uav record is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently available in the united states restricted use of uavs in the united states uav 's are currently not authorized for use in law enforcement in the united states , much to heal 's chagrin .
he said this kind of breakthrough could make a real difference in law enforcement in the united states , where he worked swat for many years .
" some of our incidents were in high-rise buildings , " he said , noting that uavs have particular advantages over helicopters , in that they 're significantly cheaper , quieter and much less visible .
" one of the most vulnerable places is the windows , but yet we ca n't see in the windows .
we could actually take a uav and park it up 20 stories and literally look right in the window as if we were standing on the ground . "
drawbacks of laser power despite the new hover record , the laser power has its flaws , too , noted strickert .
" you need a powerful laser and a tracking system and a power supply on the ground , ” he said .
strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

he 's accused of war crimes committed seven years ago in the central african republic but has denied all charges . in july 2006 , during the election in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- , jean-pierre bemba seemed poised to become the country 's next president .
it did n't happen .
his opponent , joseph kabila , won the vote .
about a year later bemba fled to portugal after clashes between his bodyguards and soldiers loyal to kabila .
in may 2008 , he was arrested by belgian police and two months later he was in a prison not far from the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
on monday , the former vice president of congo , a rebel leader and leader of congo 's main opposition party stood before judges at the icc , charged with three counts of war crimes and two counts of crimes against humanity for murder , rape and pillage allegedly committed by his movement for the liberation of congo -lrb- mlc -rrb- rebel forces in the central african republic from october 2002 to march 2003 . mlc soldiers had been invited into the central african republic by then-president ange-felix patasse to help put down a coup .
the coup leader , former army chief francois bozize , overthrew patasse and in 2004 called in the icc to investigate .
according to the lawyer for the victims of bemba 's alleged crimes , monday is a very important day .
" even if it can never make up for the harm done , the victims need to know the truth and have the possibility to tell their stories , " said marie-edith lawson of the association of women lawyers in the central african republic .
" the culprits must be punished .
that would give at least some moral satisfaction to the victims . "
local leader at fault , supporters say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bemba during happier days before congolese elections in 2006 but supporters of bemba say the drc senator and wealthy businessman is not guilty of the charges brought against him .
even if bemba was the leader of the mlc , he did n't have anything to do with atrocities committed in the central african republic .
according to bemba 's lawyer , aime kilolo , it needs to be clarified who was the real military leader involved - not of the mcl overall , but from the contingent stationed in bangui in the period during which the alleged crimes took place .
" our position is clear : the central african government asked the mlc for soldiers and these men were made available to a sovereign state , " said kilolo .
" therefore it is not possible to say that jean-pierre bemba was the local leader . "
bemba 's lawyers have repeatedly submitted petitions to get the case dismissed .
responsible as leader but to prosecutors and joint plaintiffs , bemba 's location during the atrocities is not the deciding factor in determining his innocence or guilt .
lawson says that just because bemba was not at the location where the atrocities took place does not mean that he did not know about them .
he could have just as well given orders from afar , she says .
it 's this aspect of the case that makes it so unusual .
to win their case , prosecutors must prove that those committing the crimes were bemba 's subordinates , that he had knowledge of the crimes and that he constantly failed to act or punish those crimes .
" this is the first trail in which someone must take responsibility as a military leader and not as a perpetrator or accomplice , " said fadil abdallah , the legal outreach officer at the icc .
" the international criminal court is thereby sending a strong signal that there is no immunity from prosecution for someone who holds political or administrative responsibility in his country . "
bildunterschrift : prosecutors at the icc must prove bemba 's subordinates committed the crimes big trial , big challenges but experts have said a case like this can be tough to prove .
the trial is expected to last several months .
the court has accepted 135 victims as participants in this trial and at least 37 are expected to testify .
another 1,200 applications from other victims are under consideration .
preparations have already been going on for more than two years .
besides the legal challenges facing the court , it also has an obligation to communicate often complicated trial proceedings across thousands of miles to populations in two central african countries , where infrastructures are often creaking at best .
in the drc at least , the icc has been accused of failing to communicate with local people , leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings on both sides .

while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .
the sooner australia becomes a republic and finally shakes the shackles of great britain the better for all .

this " city of three rivers " became an important center of trade .
while the fire that destroyed the city in 1662 was tragic , it was the impetus for a stunning baroque reconstruction that continues to serve as a magnet for tourists today .
passau 's many churches and abbeys - there are about 50 of them in the city - give it a special charm .
the diocese of passau once extended all the way to present-day hungary .
a stroll through the streets of the old town is akin to walking through an open-air museum .
but new life pulses behind these baroque facades : today , passau is a hub of art and culture .
the hoellgasse alleyway is now home to a number of artisans , painters , galleries and artists ' studios .
the museum of modern art was at the forefront of the city 's cultural awakening .
it was opened 20 years ago in one of passau 's most beautiful historic buildings .
passau 's old quarter is defined by an abundance of cafes and taverns .
guests can choose from hearty fare to smaller delicacies .

he contemplates on how the pilgrimage to mecca has changed his picture of saudi arabia - and talks about his conversations with foreign workers in the country . i 'm sitting among hundreds of thousands of exhausted pilgrims at jeddah airport and i know : it 's all over now .
goodbye to mecca !
thanks for having me .
and i also want to thank all the dw users who cast a critical eye on my journey and posted numerous questions .
your feedback has been a real incitement to my work - and it 's been a lot of fun .
i 'm proud that i was able to reach muslims as well as non-muslims with my diary entries .
by the way , not all of the pilgrims are going home now .
some go on to spend a vacation here , if they can afford it .
many of them stroll along the beaches of the red sea with dark sunglasses .
the hotels are still booked-out .
however , i 'm sitting here at the airport among the many other " flying pilgrims . "
in fact , the rush of people is so heavy that we were asked to be here six hours before departure time .
ex-pilgrims with sunglasses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims at a hotel in jeddah prior to my journey to mecca , i had n't personally met a saudi in my whole life .
i was only familiar with the common prejudices that other arabs like to tell each other about saudis - particularly in yemen , the extremely poor country i come from .
from a yemeni perspective , they easily seem like spoiled " brothers " from a rich neighboring country .
and while saudi arabia has close ties with western countries , it also applies a particularly conservative islamic rule - including whippings and death penalties for violations of the sharia .
my visit was too short to question or change this picture fundamentally .
however , i made some diverging observations that might help to better differentiate between the country 's people and the existing system of government .
all of the saudis that i met in the past days were very friendly - and they were open-minded as well .
let 's take the young men working for the hajj 's organizing committee : all of them had been to college , many of them in foreign countries .
and they all spoke at least three foreign languages .
they love to have fun a lot and spice up their working days with jokes .
at the same time , they 're proud muslims who are very sensitive about utterances associating islam directly or indirectly with extremism or terrorism .
" we utterly reject that , " they say .
" we 're tolerant and open-minded toward non-muslims as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating with multilingual saudi employees of the pilgrim 's office i personally had the feeling that they really meant what they said , and that they were n't just saying it to me because i 'm a journalist from a foreign media company .
however , what about the government 's policies ?
there are a number of facts that can hardly be conveyed to a foreign audience , such as the ban of christian symbols or the exclusion of women from the general public .
what is more , foreigners coming into the country need a saudi resident acting as a guarantor for them .
muhammad is fluent in korean muhammad works for the pilgrimage 's information office as well .
he studied in south korea for five years , where he lived only among locals - he 's fluent in the language .
he still raves about the time in the far east : " koreans are very kind and caring people .
they virtually love foreigners . "
i get the feeling that muhammad was really well-integrated over there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of jiddah these are the moments when you 're sitting in mecca and you 're suddenly reminded of the integration debate going on in germany .
i ask myself : is language really that important when it comes to integration ?
i wonder about that ever since i met bikhiit , a plumber who was hired by a saudi prince only for the days of the hajj .
bikhiit worked on the prince 's luxurious pilgrim 's tent in mecca .
the prince and the plumber bikhiit is from egypt .
aside from his different accent , he 's probably as good in arabic as the saudi prince .
every year , he makes sure that the prince 's pilgrim 's tent is provided with constant warm water .
the sanitary engineer has been working in saudi arabia for 16 years now - but he does n't have a single saudi friend .
" i only consort with saudis during work , " he says .
" i spend the little time off that i have in the evening with my egyptian friends in coffeehouses or watching soccer . "
when i ask him why he 's got no private contacts to locals , he replies : " for example , we egyptians have our own eating habits . "
that 's all i get from him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikhiit , the plumber of the prince however , he 's very proud of the plumbing job for the saudi prince .
and he 's very grateful to his " normal " saudi employer who allows him to work here during the hajj .
bikhiit likes to live in saudi arabia because he earns more money than in egypt .
but there 's a price to pay for that : he had to give his passport to his employer - as law dictates .
human rights activists argue that this practice establishes a situation of complete dependency .
bikhiit says : " well , at least the passport wo n't get lost . "
his family lives in egypt .
he visits them once a year .
a nepalese in a five star hotel bahadur is a guest worker as well .
he 's from nepal .
the 23-year-old prepares the rooms of a five star hotel and cleans the sanitary installations used by rich pilgrims during the hajj .
" i 'm very happy with the money i make here , " he says .
however , he 's not about to integrate into saudi society .
and nobody has ever asked him to do so , either .
even though the percentage of foreigners living in the kingdom is higher than in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahadur from nepal works in a five star hotel in jeddah i ask a saudi : " is it a problem that few guest workers here speak arabic ? "
" no , " he says - and he obviously does n't quite understand why i would ask him about the language skills of inexpensive foreign workers .
" as long as guest workers do n't consort with people here , that 's not a problem .
besides , many saudis do n't speak english ! "
integration not wanted one of the last people i meet in saudi arabia is faisal , a cab driver from pakistan who takes me to the airport .
i compliment him on his good arabic - but that does n't help him to become socially integrated or to receive a permanent right of residence .
" in the united states and in australia you can become a citizen after five years , " he raves - maybe oversimplifying it a bit .
" but you need to legally live and work in saudi arabia for 20 years in order to get a saudi passport . "
that 's also part of saudi reality : once a guest worker , always a guest worker .
when we part , faisal asks me : " do you have a german passport ? "
" no , " i tell him .
" it 's not that easy to get one .
you first have to legally work and live in germany for 8 years .
there are naturalization tests and you need to have sufficient german language skills .
faisal smiles and i smile back : " at any rate , it 's a lot easier than in saudi arabia . "

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .

integration not wanted one of the last people i meet in saudi arabia is faisal , a cab driver from pakistan who takes me to the airport .
i compliment him on his good arabic - but that does n't help him to become socially integrated or to receive a permanent right of residence .
" in the united states and in australia you can become a citizen after five years , " he raves - maybe oversimplifying it a bit .
" but you need to legally live and work in saudi arabia for 20 years in order to get a saudi passport . "
that 's also part of saudi reality : once a guest worker , always a guest worker .
when we part , faisal asks me : " do you have a german passport ? "
" no , " i tell him .
" it 's not that easy to get one .
you first have to legally work and live in germany for 8 years .
there are naturalization tests and you need to have sufficient german language skills .
faisal smiles and i smile back : " at any rate , it 's a lot easier than in saudi arabia . "

the shipping industry is a big producer of co2 emissions , but dutch company cargoshell says it 's found a way to be more environmentally friendly and cut costs at the same time . shipping is a multi-billion euro industry that is expected to grow massively in the next decade .
one of the main concerns of the industry in the current economic climate is not only how to reduce costs but also how to be more environmentally friendly .
according to a 2008 un report , shipping creates double the co2 emissions of the aviation industry . dutch company cargoshell thinks its new , foldable fiberglass cargo containers are the solution to both of these problems .
the company claims they are an innovation compared to the steel shipping containers that have been the industry standard for over 50 years .
cargoshell ceo john houtman said the unique folding design of the glass and resin containers make them perfect for cutting costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargoshell 's containers are foldable , making them space-saving when empty " about 25 percent of all shipments are empty containers , " he said .
" when you collapse an empty cargoshell container , it is just a quarter of the normal size .
so when you transport the containers , you can pile many more empty containers onto one shipment , and that 's better for the environment . " however , cargoshell containers are currently three times more expensive to manufacture than their steel equivalents , raising doubts that shipping operators will be willing to make the initial investment in order to green their business . " i think the product has potential , but if the price is too high , then it raises questions about getting it onto the market , " said sander sprengers , a general manager at cma cgm , the world 's third-biggest container shipping group . price barrier a concern " another concern is that the maintenance and repair costs may also be high , and that the extra handling costs for the manpower needed to fold the containers up and down could be higher than today 's type of operation , " sprengers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completely folded , a cargoshell container can lie flat houtman said his company is aware of the concerns but added they would be minimized if cargoshell containers were to go into large-scale production .
shipping operators should also bear long-term savings in mind , he added . " if you look at the total transporter chain , the cost-saving potential is tremendous , " houtman said .
" a single ship might go from china to rotterdam with 8,000 containers .
our containers weigh 400 kilograms less than metal ones , so in one transport , you get fuel savings of 526,000 euros , not to mention the co2 savings . " cargoshell containers offer a further benefit : they enable the use of radio signals to track the containers ' progress , something that is currently difficult to do with the steel model . " composite is radio neutral - we can track and trace each container from all over the world , " said houtman .
" we can be informed of the status of each container , whether it 's open or closed , what the inside temperature is .
all of this information can be sent to the company . " developers say the cargoshell containers will have a lifespan of 90 years , but it 's the next decade that they 're focusing on at the moment .
the design needs to pass a series of international standard tests to make sure it has the strength and durability of the conventional steel containers .
the results should be known later this year . company hoping for four percent share if it gets the green light , cargoshell hopes to have a million containers in use by 2020 , taking a 4 percent share of the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shipping operators are used to working with steel containers " i think four percent is quite a lot , " said bart kuipers , an economist based at rotterdam 's erasmus university .
" much depends on how serious the shipping companies are about making their operations greener . " kuipers thinks there might be other niche markets for the foldable containers - in the aid and military logistics markets , for example . " think of the problems with a country like afghanistan , which has no ports , and very difficult roads across mountain landscape , " kuipers said .
" i think cargoshell is a very attractive proposition for these kinds of niche markets . " cargoshell launched its revolutionary containers eight months ago , but the first batch of foldable containers has yet to be produced .
still , houtman is encouraged by the initial backing he 's received from major shipping companies , and a high degree of interest in the product from around the world . " we know that some countries , such as australia and belgium , are very interested in the product , and we have received lots of queries from china and india , " houtman said . author : dave goodman -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.11.2010 eu agrees bailout for ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland has admitted it needs financial help eu finance ministers have agreed on a bailout fund for ireland to tackle the country 's huge budget deficit and save its banking sector .
it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .
the euro had faced heavy selling recently due to concerns over ireland 's debts ' impact on the economic bloc .

an international un effort in the 1990s there failed .
in 2007 , neighboring ethiopia invaded - with backing by the united states - but could n't bring about the desired stability in somalia , either . since 2009 , a western-backed interim government under moderate islamic politician sheikh sharif ahmed has been struggling to hold on to power in central mogadishu .
it can only do so with the help of 7,000 african union -lrb- au -rrb- soldiers .
large parts of the rest of the country are controlled by al shabab militia . the al qaeda-linked shabab militia allegedly has fighters from afghanistan , pakistan and chechnya in their ranks .
the estimated 7,000 militants are well-armed and supported primarily by neighboring eritrea .
but funding also comes from arab circles who want to push back western influence in the region . this is also a reason why western countries do n't want to leave somalia to its own devices , said georges-marc andre , the european commission 's special envoy for somalia .
there 's too much at stake on the horn of africa , he said .
after all , somalia controlled one of the most significant sea routes in international shipping through its position on the gulf of aden .
but the stability of the entire region could also be threatened by somali backed radical islamists , he said . " clearly the war has been started by somalis , " andre said .
" but they are also victims of those who are looking to use somalia as a platform to destabilize the region , whether you speak of the middle east , the states in the arabian gulf or some african countries such as ethiopia , kenya or uganda . " a humanitarian catastrophe andre coordinates eu aid for the collapsed nation from nairobi in neighboring kenya .
in 2010 alone , the eu has made 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid and state-building efforts in somalia .
when the security situation permits , he travels to mogadishu to get a picture of the current situation in somalia .
but there is nothing for andre to gloss over when it comes to the circumstances in the horn of africa . " when you look at the terrorist attacks , when you look at all those civilians who are being killed - including kids and women - when you see the al shabab actions being carried out by child soldiers , when you look at all of this , obviously the situation is awful , " andre said . the civilian population has to bear the brunt of the chaos .
there are 1.5 million internally displaced persons in somalia .
but it is virtually impossible to get humanitarian help to those in need , as the shabab prevent western aid organizations from accessing regions they control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has had no central government since siad barre was overthrown in 1991 " if you look at the needs in the al shabab controlled areas , you will see a very patchy distribution with some dark places where nobody today is about to deliver healthcare , water or nutrition for the children , " said philippe royan , head of the somalia office of the european commission humanitarian aid department . in addition , humanitarian workers are " not welcome " to monitor and assess the population 's needs , royan said . crucial african union support according to experts , the interim government in mogadishu supported by the west would collapse within a few days if it was not protected by the 7,000 au soldiers .
but their deployment since 2007 has only progressed sluggishly .
the au 's contingent still has n't reached its required strength , said wafula wamunyinyi , the deputy special representative from the au commission for somalia . he said the deployment in somalia was supposed to take place in phases .
the first phase was mogadishu . " then after securing mogadishu , where the government would then operate , the next phase was to extend to the countryside , of course with an increased number of troops , and other parts of the country , " wamunyinyi said .
" we are quite on track .
it 's just that there has been some delay due to the slow pace at which countries have deployed their troops . " an investment in the future eu countries finance the au mission in somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- indirectly , for example by training 2,000 somali soldiers in uganda .
for special envoy andre , helping to rebuild somalia is an investment in the future .
after all , western nations ' security was also dependent on the african country 's stability , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers belonging to islamist militias are patrolling mogadishu " if your neighbors like the somalis are in trouble , you have to be worried about peace in europe , " he said .
" what we have to invest now is nothing compared to what we would have to invest in the future if we do n't do something to stabilize and bring back peace in somalia . " according to andre , the impact piracy has had on world trade was a prime example of where somalia was heading .
somali pirates were responsible for 44 percent of the 289 piracy incidents on the world 's seas in the first nine months of 2010 , according to a report published by the international maritime bureau . " that is the reason why we should invest now in somalia , now that time is still there to do something positive with reasonable means , " andre said . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 22.11.2010 uav flight record set by german-american team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new uav set a hover record of over 12 hours the new record for small uavs now stands at over 12 hours of flight time .
the mini-aircraft is powered through a focused laser pointed at the uav , rather than relying solely on batteries . unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs have long been used by the military for applications ranging from reconnaissance and surveillance to armed attacks .
while larger uavs are powered in the same way as conventional aircraft , small uavs - under five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- - are battery powered , which generally limits flight time to 20 to 45 minutes .
however , german and american research teams have been working hard to overcome the shortcomings of battery-life and recently set a world record earlier this month at 12 hours , 26 minutes and 56.9 seconds .
the asctec pelican is a small quadrocopter developed by ascending technologies , a young german company based just outside of munich .
the pelican weighs less than a kilogram and is less than 45 cm across -lrb- almost 18 inches -rrb- .
ascending technologies teamed up with lasermotive , an american research company that specializes in laser power technology , and was the winner of the 2009 nasa-sponsored power beaming competition .
in their reach for the holy grail of unlimited power for uavs , researchers fitted solar cells to the underside of the asctec pelican .
when hit by the laser , which can reach up to one kilometer , these cells convert the beam into electrical power and continuously charge the battery .
conceivably , this uav could stay aloft forever , given unlimited laser power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael achtelik is the ceo of ascending technologies , the company behind the asctec pelican the asctec pelican 's battery lasts for 20 minutes , so for it to fly for over 12 hours is a major breakthrough , said michael achtelik , the ceo of ascending technologies , in an interview with deutsche welle .
an order of magnitude greater law enforcement experts also are impressed by the new uav 's hover , or loiter , time .
" a uav that has a 12 hour loiter time , its right off the charts right now , ” said charles " sid " heal , a technology consultant and technology chairman for the national tactical officers association in the united states .
heal is also a former commander in the los angeles county sheriffs department .
" to give you an example , the best hover uav that we have in the united states right now , even under the most ideal conditions , would have a loiter time less than one hour .
so they 've increased the loiter time by one order of magnitude . "
beyond law enforcement officials , others in the scientific community say that this new approach shows promise .
" it shows how much energy can be transferred via this laser powered system , since the quadrocopter system needs about three times more energy than a conventional fixed wing uav , " said gordon strickert , a research scientist at the german aerospace center in braunschweig .
" it also shows that such a quadrocoptor system can be flown very precisely and can hold its position accurately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new uav record is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently available in the united states restricted use of uavs in the united states uav 's are currently not authorized for use in law enforcement in the united states , much to heal 's chagrin .
he said this kind of breakthrough could make a real difference in law enforcement in the united states , where he worked swat for many years .
" some of our incidents were in high-rise buildings , " he said , noting that uavs have particular advantages over helicopters , in that they 're significantly cheaper , quieter and much less visible .
" one of the most vulnerable places is the windows , but yet we ca n't see in the windows .
we could actually take a uav and park it up 20 stories and literally look right in the window as if we were standing on the ground . "
drawbacks of laser power despite the new hover record , the laser power has its flaws , too , noted strickert .
" you need a powerful laser and a tracking system and a power supply on the ground , ” he said .
strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

an international un effort in the 1990s there failed .
in 2007 , neighboring ethiopia invaded - with backing by the united states - but could n't bring about the desired stability in somalia , either . since 2009 , a western-backed interim government under moderate islamic politician sheikh sharif ahmed has been struggling to hold on to power in central mogadishu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 22.11.2010 uav flight record set by german-american team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new uav set a hover record of over 12 hours the new record for small uavs now stands at over 12 hours of flight time .
the mini-aircraft is powered through a focused laser pointed at the uav , rather than relying solely on batteries . unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs have long been used by the military for applications ranging from reconnaissance and surveillance to armed attacks .
while larger uavs are powered in the same way as conventional aircraft , small uavs - under five kilograms -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- - are battery powered , which generally limits flight time to 20 to 45 minutes .
however , german and american research teams have been working hard to overcome the shortcomings of battery-life and recently set a world record earlier this month at 12 hours , 26 minutes and 56.9 seconds .
the asctec pelican is a small quadrocopter developed by ascending technologies , a young german company based just outside of munich .
the pelican weighs less than a kilogram and is less than 45 cm across -lrb- almost 18 inches -rrb- .
ascending technologies teamed up with lasermotive , an american research company that specializes in laser power technology , and was the winner of the 2009 nasa-sponsored power beaming competition .
in their reach for the holy grail of unlimited power for uavs , researchers fitted solar cells to the underside of the asctec pelican .
when hit by the laser , which can reach up to one kilometer , these cells convert the beam into electrical power and continuously charge the battery .
conceivably , this uav could stay aloft forever , given unlimited laser power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael achtelik is the ceo of ascending technologies , the company behind the asctec pelican the asctec pelican 's battery lasts for 20 minutes , so for it to fly for over 12 hours is a major breakthrough , said michael achtelik , the ceo of ascending technologies , in an interview with deutsche welle .
an order of magnitude greater law enforcement experts also are impressed by the new uav 's hover , or loiter , time .
" a uav that has a 12 hour loiter time , its right off the charts right now , ” said charles " sid " heal , a technology consultant and technology chairman for the national tactical officers association in the united states .
heal is also a former commander in the los angeles county sheriffs department .
" to give you an example , the best hover uav that we have in the united states right now , even under the most ideal conditions , would have a loiter time less than one hour .
so they 've increased the loiter time by one order of magnitude . "
beyond law enforcement officials , others in the scientific community say that this new approach shows promise .
" it shows how much energy can be transferred via this laser powered system , since the quadrocopter system needs about three times more energy than a conventional fixed wing uav , " said gordon strickert , a research scientist at the german aerospace center in braunschweig .
" it also shows that such a quadrocoptor system can be flown very precisely and can hold its position accurately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new uav record is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently available in the united states restricted use of uavs in the united states uav 's are currently not authorized for use in law enforcement in the united states , much to heal 's chagrin .
he said this kind of breakthrough could make a real difference in law enforcement in the united states , where he worked swat for many years .
" some of our incidents were in high-rise buildings , " he said , noting that uavs have particular advantages over helicopters , in that they 're significantly cheaper , quieter and much less visible .
" one of the most vulnerable places is the windows , but yet we ca n't see in the windows .
we could actually take a uav and park it up 20 stories and literally look right in the window as if we were standing on the ground . "
drawbacks of laser power despite the new hover record , the laser power has its flaws , too , noted strickert .
" you need a powerful laser and a tracking system and a power supply on the ground , ” he said .
strickert also pointed out that that the whole system is extremely inefficient because less than 10 percent of the power needed to drive the laser is converted into energy in order to fly the uav .
strickert also said that it 's not possible to " perform rapid manoeuvres or out of sight operations when you do n't fit in an additional battery . "
however , michael achtelik from ascending technologies countered that the uav has an onboard battery that can be used when the uav flies outside of the range of the laser beam .
while some critics say that staying in the line of sight of the laser beam is a limitation , heal said that when uav 's finally get the go ahead from the united states federal aeronautics administration , they will probably only be allowed to be flown within line of sight anyway .
heal predicts that this kind of uav might also have civilian applications too - he posited that they could be used by lifeguards to patrol the surf line and to alert them of swimmers in distress .
still , this kind of application may not take place until researchers can solidify the power situation - german researchers ideally would like to use solar power so that a uav could stay aloft indefinitely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 22.11.2010 war crimes trial of congo 's former vice president begins in the hague großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-pierre bemba , right , faces multiple charges at the icc the trial of former congolese rebel leader jean-pierre bemba has begun at the international criminal court .
he 's accused of war crimes committed seven years ago in the central african republic but has denied all charges . in july 2006 , during the election in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- , jean-pierre bemba seemed poised to become the country 's next president .
it did n't happen .
his opponent , joseph kabila , won the vote .
about a year later bemba fled to portugal after clashes between his bodyguards and soldiers loyal to kabila .
in may 2008 , he was arrested by belgian police and two months later he was in a prison not far from the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
on monday , the former vice president of congo , a rebel leader and leader of congo 's main opposition party stood before judges at the icc , charged with three counts of war crimes and two counts of crimes against humanity for murder , rape and pillage allegedly committed by his movement for the liberation of congo -lrb- mlc -rrb- rebel forces in the central african republic from october 2002 to march 2003 . mlc soldiers had been invited into the central african republic by then-president ange-felix patasse to help put down a coup .
the coup leader , former army chief francois bozize , overthrew patasse and in 2004 called in the icc to investigate .
according to the lawyer for the victims of bemba 's alleged crimes , monday is a very important day .
" even if it can never make up for the harm done , the victims need to know the truth and have the possibility to tell their stories , " said marie-edith lawson of the association of women lawyers in the central african republic .
" the culprits must be punished .
that would give at least some moral satisfaction to the victims . "
local leader at fault , supporters say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bemba during happier days before congolese elections in 2006 but supporters of bemba say the drc senator and wealthy businessman is not guilty of the charges brought against him .
even if bemba was the leader of the mlc , he did n't have anything to do with atrocities committed in the central african republic .
according to bemba 's lawyer , aime kilolo , it needs to be clarified who was the real military leader involved - not of the mcl overall , but from the contingent stationed in bangui in the period during which the alleged crimes took place .
" our position is clear : the central african government asked the mlc for soldiers and these men were made available to a sovereign state , " said kilolo .
" therefore it is not possible to say that jean-pierre bemba was the local leader . "
bemba 's lawyers have repeatedly submitted petitions to get the case dismissed .
responsible as leader but to prosecutors and joint plaintiffs , bemba 's location during the atrocities is not the deciding factor in determining his innocence or guilt .
lawson says that just because bemba was not at the location where the atrocities took place does not mean that he did not know about them .
he could have just as well given orders from afar , she says .
it 's this aspect of the case that makes it so unusual .
to win their case , prosecutors must prove that those committing the crimes were bemba 's subordinates , that he had knowledge of the crimes and that he constantly failed to act or punish those crimes .
" this is the first trail in which someone must take responsibility as a military leader and not as a perpetrator or accomplice , " said fadil abdallah , the legal outreach officer at the icc .
" the international criminal court is thereby sending a strong signal that there is no immunity from prosecution for someone who holds political or administrative responsibility in his country . "
bildunterschrift : prosecutors at the icc must prove bemba 's subordinates committed the crimes big trial , big challenges but experts have said a case like this can be tough to prove .
the trial is expected to last several months .
the court has accepted 135 victims as participants in this trial and at least 37 are expected to testify .
another 1,200 applications from other victims are under consideration .
preparations have already been going on for more than two years .
besides the legal challenges facing the court , it also has an obligation to communicate often complicated trial proceedings across thousands of miles to populations in two central african countries , where infrastructures are often creaking at best .
in the drc at least , the icc has been accused of failing to communicate with local people , leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings on both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 22.11.2010 war crimes trial of congo 's former vice president begins in the hague großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-pierre bemba , right , faces multiple charges at the icc the trial of former congolese rebel leader jean-pierre bemba has begun at the international criminal court .
he 's accused of war crimes committed seven years ago in the central african republic but has denied all charges . in july 2006 , during the election in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- , jean-pierre bemba seemed poised to become the country 's next president .
it did n't happen .
his opponent , joseph kabila , won the vote .
about a year later bemba fled to portugal after clashes between his bodyguards and soldiers loyal to kabila .
in may 2008 , he was arrested by belgian police and two months later he was in a prison not far from the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
on monday , the former vice president of congo , a rebel leader and leader of congo 's main opposition party stood before judges at the icc , charged with three counts of war crimes and two counts of crimes against humanity for murder , rape and pillage allegedly committed by his movement for the liberation of congo -lrb- mlc -rrb- rebel forces in the central african republic from october 2002 to march 2003 . mlc soldiers had been invited into the central african republic by then-president ange-felix patasse to help put down a coup .
the coup leader , former army chief francois bozize , overthrew patasse and in 2004 called in the icc to investigate .
according to the lawyer for the victims of bemba 's alleged crimes , monday is a very important day .
" even if it can never make up for the harm done , the victims need to know the truth and have the possibility to tell their stories , " said marie-edith lawson of the association of women lawyers in the central african republic .
" the culprits must be punished .
that would give at least some moral satisfaction to the victims . "
local leader at fault , supporters say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bemba during happier days before congolese elections in 2006 but supporters of bemba say the drc senator and wealthy businessman is not guilty of the charges brought against him .
even if bemba was the leader of the mlc , he did n't have anything to do with atrocities committed in the central african republic .
according to bemba 's lawyer , aime kilolo , it needs to be clarified who was the real military leader involved - not of the mcl overall , but from the contingent stationed in bangui in the period during which the alleged crimes took place .
" our position is clear : the central african government asked the mlc for soldiers and these men were made available to a sovereign state , " said kilolo .
" therefore it is not possible to say that jean-pierre bemba was the local leader . "
bemba 's lawyers have repeatedly submitted petitions to get the case dismissed .
responsible as leader but to prosecutors and joint plaintiffs , bemba 's location during the atrocities is not the deciding factor in determining his innocence or guilt .
lawson says that just because bemba was not at the location where the atrocities took place does not mean that he did not know about them .
he could have just as well given orders from afar , she says .
it 's this aspect of the case that makes it so unusual .
to win their case , prosecutors must prove that those committing the crimes were bemba 's subordinates , that he had knowledge of the crimes and that he constantly failed to act or punish those crimes .
" this is the first trail in which someone must take responsibility as a military leader and not as a perpetrator or accomplice , " said fadil abdallah , the legal outreach officer at the icc .
" the international criminal court is thereby sending a strong signal that there is no immunity from prosecution for someone who holds political or administrative responsibility in his country . "
bildunterschrift : prosecutors at the icc must prove bemba 's subordinates committed the crimes big trial , big challenges but experts have said a case like this can be tough to prove .
the trial is expected to last several months .
the court has accepted 135 victims as participants in this trial and at least 37 are expected to testify .
another 1,200 applications from other victims are under consideration .
preparations have already been going on for more than two years .
besides the legal challenges facing the court , it also has an obligation to communicate often complicated trial proceedings across thousands of miles to populations in two central african countries , where infrastructures are often creaking at best .
in the drc at least , the icc has been accused of failing to communicate with local people , leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings on both sides .

" people and politics " , produced weekly opposite the german parliament , offers just the right stage for probes into german policy-making – be it through in-depth , incisive reporting or interviews . a whole team of dedicated reporters and authors guarantee the show ´ s journalistic consistency , which is just as reliable as the boats ferrying along the spree river in the background !
the production site – set in the heart of berlin ´ s government and parliamentary district – sets the tone of the programme which also seeks to showcase and explain political developments affecting germany and europe . charles and his colleagues are seasoned watchers when it comes to germany ´ s recent political history .
perhaps the most challenging task was covering the collapse of communism in east germany .
charles vividly remembers reporting live for radio from the roof of a transmission truck next to the berlin wall near the brandenburg gate .
when he asked two nonplussed east german border guards when the gate would be opened to the west they mumbled something about losing the key … with the advent of german unity and now the challenges facing the people and the politicians as they grapple with unemployment and the impact of globalisation , reporting from berlin has become even more multifacetted : a development mirrored in the wide range of dw-tv ´ s programming and political coverage as presented in “ people and politics ” .
on a more personal note : charles ashton was born and bred in london , and he tries bravely to mask his london , cockney accent , though he can ´ t help slipping in a certain ironic accent every now and then ! .
he studied political science and german history at the universities of bonn and freiburg .
travelling is one of his favourite hobbies - and trying to understand the mentality of the berliners as they wrestle courageously with berlin 's role as a major european metropolis .

the shipping industry is a big producer of co2 emissions , but dutch company cargoshell says it 's found a way to be more environmentally friendly and cut costs at the same time . shipping is a multi-billion euro industry that is expected to grow massively in the next decade .
one of the main concerns of the industry in the current economic climate is not only how to reduce costs but also how to be more environmentally friendly .
according to a 2008 un report , shipping creates double the co2 emissions of the aviation industry . dutch company cargoshell thinks its new , foldable fiberglass cargo containers are the solution to both of these problems .
the company claims they are an innovation compared to the steel shipping containers that have been the industry standard for over 50 years .
cargoshell ceo john houtman said the unique folding design of the glass and resin containers make them perfect for cutting costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargoshell 's containers are foldable , making them space-saving when empty " about 25 percent of all shipments are empty containers , " he said .
" when you collapse an empty cargoshell container , it is just a quarter of the normal size .
so when you transport the containers , you can pile many more empty containers onto one shipment , and that 's better for the environment . " however , cargoshell containers are currently three times more expensive to manufacture than their steel equivalents , raising doubts that shipping operators will be willing to make the initial investment in order to green their business . " i think the product has potential , but if the price is too high , then it raises questions about getting it onto the market , " said sander sprengers , a general manager at cma cgm , the world 's third-biggest container shipping group . price barrier a concern " another concern is that the maintenance and repair costs may also be high , and that the extra handling costs for the manpower needed to fold the containers up and down could be higher than today 's type of operation , " sprengers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completely folded , a cargoshell container can lie flat houtman said his company is aware of the concerns but added they would be minimized if cargoshell containers were to go into large-scale production .
shipping operators should also bear long-term savings in mind , he added . " if you look at the total transporter chain , the cost-saving potential is tremendous , " houtman said .
" a single ship might go from china to rotterdam with 8,000 containers .
our containers weigh 400 kilograms less than metal ones , so in one transport , you get fuel savings of 526,000 euros , not to mention the co2 savings . " cargoshell containers offer a further benefit : they enable the use of radio signals to track the containers ' progress , something that is currently difficult to do with the steel model . " composite is radio neutral - we can track and trace each container from all over the world , " said houtman .
" we can be informed of the status of each container , whether it 's open or closed , what the inside temperature is .
all of this information can be sent to the company . " developers say the cargoshell containers will have a lifespan of 90 years , but it 's the next decade that they 're focusing on at the moment .
the design needs to pass a series of international standard tests to make sure it has the strength and durability of the conventional steel containers .
the results should be known later this year . company hoping for four percent share if it gets the green light , cargoshell hopes to have a million containers in use by 2020 , taking a 4 percent share of the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shipping operators are used to working with steel containers " i think four percent is quite a lot , " said bart kuipers , an economist based at rotterdam 's erasmus university .
" much depends on how serious the shipping companies are about making their operations greener . " kuipers thinks there might be other niche markets for the foldable containers - in the aid and military logistics markets , for example . " think of the problems with a country like afghanistan , which has no ports , and very difficult roads across mountain landscape , " kuipers said .
" i think cargoshell is a very attractive proposition for these kinds of niche markets . " cargoshell launched its revolutionary containers eight months ago , but the first batch of foldable containers has yet to be produced .
still , houtman is encouraged by the initial backing he 's received from major shipping companies , and a high degree of interest in the product from around the world . " we know that some countries , such as australia and belgium , are very interested in the product , and we have received lots of queries from china and india , " houtman said . author : dave goodman -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

'
limited background information on the pirates could hamper the case . the first pirate trial to take place in germany in 400 years has opened in hamburg .
more than seven months after the attack on the hamburg-registered container ship ms taipan , 10 somali men are standing trial .
they are charged with attacking the ship some 900 kilometers -lrb- 560 miles -rrb- east of the somali coast in april .
one of the defendants has told the court that he was 13 years old at the time of the attack , which would mean he could not be tried under german law .
experts in the court believe he is likely 15 or older ; however , with little reliable documentation on the youngster , this could be difficult to prove .
" a child should not be obliged to stand in court , if his given age of 13 is correct , " the chair of the judging panel , bernd steinmetz said .
the eldest accused said he was 48 , while the other eight all stated ages between 16 and 28 ; but none of them could give his precise date of birth .
the accused have been communicating via interpreters , as they do n't speak german .
possible sentences between 10 and 15 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taipan was freed by dutch marines nobody was injured when the taipan vessel was taken hostage in april .
the ship 's 15-man crew fled to a safety room when the pirates boarded their ship , and the pirates were eventually captured by dutch naval forces .
the alleged pirates were extradited to germany in june .
since then , they have been in custody awaiting trial .
the defendants could get sentences of anywhere from 10 to 15 years in prison if found guilty .
the prosecution says it has evidence that the men were in possession of kalashnikov rifles , grenade launchers , knives and ladders for boarding ships .
the team of 20 defense lawyers jointly appealed to the court to consider the circumstances in somalia , an all-but lawless country racked by two decades of civil war , where they said life was marked by hunger , terror and a lack of medicine .
" the somali people are suffering ; there is no possibility of fleeing within the country , " the lawyers argued .
piracy is a growing problem off the coast of somalia , with both the number of attacks and the ransoms demanded spiking over the past two years , the london-based international maritime bureau told afp news service .
some 23 vessels and 500 crew are currently held by somali pirates , the bureau said .

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .

while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.11.2010 reichstag dome closed to public after terror warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reichstag dome is a popular tourist destination amid heightened concern about a possible terror attack on german soil , the glass dome of the country 's parliament has been closed to the public .
politicians warned that some dangers were being overstated . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has said that security agencies are working to prevent a possible terror attack , but he criticized news organizations for their reporting on the threat , saying it was a danger in its own right .
speaking on a german news talk show on sunday evening , de maiziere took pains to distance himself from " irresponsible speculation " about terror threats published by weekly news magazine der spiegel and other news outlets .
after de maiziere had given a terror warning earlier in the week , der spiegel reported that al-qaeda operatives were planning a bloody hostage-taking attack on the reichstag , in berlin , before the end of november .
the reichstag is the seat of german parliament .
on monday , the glassed-in cupola of the reichstag - a favorite tourist destination - was closed to the public , although pre-arranged group tours were still taking place .
closing the reichstag but on sunday , de maiziere warned , " speculation has a psychological effect in itself .
it also spreads fear . "
he assured the public that the government is " taking the threat seriously , without being completely sure " about what the threat is , or when an attack would be expected .
the government 's terror warning on wednesday was reportedly based on internal sources .
der spiegel cited a jihadist who contacted the german authorities , as well as data from foreign intelligence sources , including the fbi .
the interior ministry has not issued denials on the sources of the reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere has said the security forces can not guarantee absolute safety other conservative politicians jumped on the message of warning against spreading panic over the terror threats as well .
on sunday , christian democrat home affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told the bild newspaper that : " we need the right balance between alertness and calm , and we should n't change our daily lives . "
he said the likelihood of having a traffic accident was higher than of being the victim of a terror attack , adding " nonetheless i get into my car , a bus or a train every day . "
increased security measures for his part , de maiziere told moderator will that there was " no answer to how we have to act so as to completely avoid terrorism , " nor was there any point in trying to placate terrorists .
" if we do what terrorists tell us - like immediately withdraw from afghanistan , or introduce sharia law in germany , … even that might not stop them .
we have to behave how we see fit . "
de maiziere 's warning on wednesday led to increased security at airports and train stations across germany .
for the few weeks prior to the alert , he had repeatedly played down a number of reports and warnings from the us about possible terrorist assaults in europe .
germany has not been hit by a major islamist terror attack in the past decade , although there have been a number of planned attacks which were prevented or which failed .
but german troops ' engagement in afghanistan has brought the country closer to the attention of islamic radicals . but now , german police say , the danger of an islamist terrorist attack in germany has never been more specific .
the head of the german police force , matthias seeger , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper that there have been a number of tip-offs from different sources .
on tuesday , a parliamentary committee will be holding a special session to discuss the current threat level , christian democrat lawmaker stefan mueller told dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

the country does not have a warning system like those in the uk and the us . one of germany 's most popular tourist attractions , the glass dome of the reichstag in berlin , was closed to tourists on monday following media reports of a plot by islamist extremists to attack the german parliament building .
in several incidents across germany these past days , police cordoned off abandoned packages after what turned out to be false alarms .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel moved to reassure the population , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that security forces were doing everything in their power to protect the country , just days after the interior minister announced there was a " new security situation " in germany .
it is high time authorities started considering adopting a system of terror warning levels in germany , philipp holtmann , a terrorism expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- told deutsche welle .
code red ? " if we look at the situation we are confronted with right now , we are on the borderline between panicking and hysteria -lsb- on the one hand -rsb- and absolute negligence of the situation -lsb- on the other -rsb- ; people do not know how to estimate the threat that really exists , " he said .
terror alert levels would make it much easier for the population to deal with the threats , holtmann said , because there would be more clarity than there is now : " every hour , we have new reports in the media that give us different scenarios , that tell us different confusing and often contradicting facts , and it would be much easier for the population if there was a clear terror warning alert system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go about your daily life , experts say people can not prevent terrorism , holtmann said , but according to a warning system , people could raise or lower their awareness for things going on around them .
they should continue to keep on living their normal lives but be more alert : " there is no recipe how to do this .
it is not this bag or this person , this language or this culture that needs to be watched , it 's a general awareness , " he said .
in the us , the homeland security advisory system codes threat levels from yellow , or elevated , to red , or severe and accordingly issues warnings to the public .
britain has a system of five threat levels ranging from low to critical .
disagreement over step-by-step warning systems george kassimeris , a senior research fellow in conflict and terrorism at the university of wolverhampton in the uk , said germany would be ill-advised in following the british and us terror alert example .
the systems made sense in theory , he told deutsche welle , but in practice they could be counterproductive : " with all these different levels and colors , the end result is a certain degree of panic , confusion and anxiety among the population because the population are not in possession of the knowledge and information the intelligence services are when they issue all these different warnings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the police prepared ?
the intelligence services , the british expert said , would never notify the public in advance of an imminent terror threat because if they did , they would be giving the game away to the terrorists .
" ordinary people can do absolutely nothing about it " kassimeris said that at first , people heed terror warnings , but at some point , they stop paying attention because they make no difference to their lives .
terrorism has become a part of our lives , kassimeris said , and it is bound to continue to be a part of our lives because there will always be people who resort to violence to advance their fanatical beliefs .
" the population can not possibly be prepared , " according to kassimeris - but the intelligence and security agencies can . the debate should not be about whether the public was prepared , he said , but whether the security services who are responsible for protecting people 's safety are prepared to the very maximum to deal with the threat .

it 's the second eu bailout package this year . european union finance ministers agreed on sunday to fund a massive bailout package for member state ireland , just hours after ireland announced it would ask the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for help in tackling its huge budget deficit and save its struggling banking sector .
" irish banks will become significantly smaller than they have in the past , so that they can gradually be brought to stand on their own two feet once more , " irish prime minister brian cowen told a news conference .
" the second key element of the agreement will be a program to reduce our budget deficit .
put simply , the government has to increase our taxes and reduce our spending to levels we can afford . "
in the context of a joint eu-imf program , the financial assistance package to the irish state should be financed from the european financial stabilization mechanism -lrb- efsm -rrb- and the european financial stability facility -lrb- efsf -rrb- , possibly supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by eu member states .
the uk and sweden have already indicated that they would consider bilateral loans .
the exact size of the bailout has not been specified , but cowen said it would be less than 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 137.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen has been under fire from all sides for his handling of the crisis tough terms german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on sunday that the terms of the deal would be " tough . "
details are to be worked out in the next few days , " so that it 's not just a shot in the arm , but that it will also help to solve the problem , " he said on german television .
irish officials had been holding talks with representatives from the eu , the imf and the european central bank since thursday .
ministers are to meet this week to finalize austerity measures aimed at saving 15 billion euros by 2014 .
ireland 's budget deficit is set to hit an eye-watering 32 percent of gross domestic product , way in excess of the eu 's three percent limit .
its banking sector was left reeling after a property boom that fueled reckless lending practices turned to bust , leading to a multi-billion euro bailout of its largest financial institution , anglo-irish bank .
fierce criticism the announcement came after intense criticism from the ranks of the ruling party , fianna fail , as well as the opposition about the way the government has handled the crisis .
" fianna fail as a party must change and it must call an election , even if it means we will lose power , " fianna fail lawmaker john mcguiness wrote in the irish mail on sunday newspaper .
" -lsb- prime minister -rsb- brian cowen must step down , " he added .
ireland has also been under fire internationally for holding on to its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent , which countries like germany believe gives ireland an unfair advantage in attracting investment , while at the same time taking advantage of eu and imf funds .
but lenihan and cowen reiterated on sunday that talks on the tax rate " are not on the agenda . "
ireland 's ambassador to germany , david mulhall , also defended the low tax rate .
" to force ireland to change its tax system would be counter-productive , because first and foremost , what ireland needs in the next few years is strong growth , " he told german daily tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other eurozone nations are wary about the future international reactions pessimism seemed to be the prevailing attitude in other troubled member states .
" i think it means portugal is next -lsb- to request help -rsb- .
i do n't know if it will happen before the end of the year or after , but it 's almost inevitable now , " filipe garcia at informacao de mercados financeiros in porto told reuters .
" i do n't know what the markets will say tomorrow , " said pedro schwartz at san pablo university in madrid .
" if portugal is forced to take a bailout then they 'll turn their attention to spain ...
i think spain is differentiated but they 're not out of the woods .
and the euro in general is not out of the woods . "
the group of seven wealthy nations ' finance ministers released a statement welcoming the bailout announcement .
" the coordinated action of european countries and the imf reflects our shared resolve to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate emerging risks , maintain market stability , and safeguard the global recovery , " they said in a joint statement issued by canada 's finance ministry .
the euro rallied based on news of the bailout , passing 1.37 dollars in asian trading .

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .

but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else .

'
limited background information on the pirates could hamper the case . the first pirate trial to take place in germany in 400 years has opened in hamburg .
more than seven months after the attack on the hamburg-registered container ship ms taipan , 10 somali men are standing trial .
they are charged with attacking the ship some 900 kilometers -lrb- 560 miles -rrb- east of the somali coast in april .
one of the defendants has told the court that he was 13 years old at the time of the attack , which would mean he could not be tried under german law .
experts in the court believe he is likely 15 or older ; however , with little reliable documentation on the youngster , this could be difficult to prove .
" a child should not be obliged to stand in court , if his given age of 13 is correct , " the chair of the judging panel , bernd steinmetz said .
the eldest accused said he was 48 , while the other eight all stated ages between 16 and 28 ; but none of them could give his precise date of birth .
the accused have been communicating via interpreters , as they do n't speak german .
possible sentences between 10 and 15 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taipan was freed by dutch marines nobody was injured when the taipan vessel was taken hostage in april .
the ship 's 15-man crew fled to a safety room when the pirates boarded their ship , and the pirates were eventually captured by dutch naval forces .
the alleged pirates were extradited to germany in june .
since then , they have been in custody awaiting trial .
the defendants could get sentences of anywhere from 10 to 15 years in prison if found guilty .
the prosecution says it has evidence that the men were in possession of kalashnikov rifles , grenade launchers , knives and ladders for boarding ships .
the team of 20 defense lawyers jointly appealed to the court to consider the circumstances in somalia , an all-but lawless country racked by two decades of civil war , where they said life was marked by hunger , terror and a lack of medicine .
" the somali people are suffering ; there is no possibility of fleeing within the country , " the lawyers argued .
piracy is a growing problem off the coast of somalia , with both the number of attacks and the ransoms demanded spiking over the past two years , the london-based international maritime bureau told afp news service .
some 23 vessels and 500 crew are currently held by somali pirates , the bureau said .

"
the vatican newspaper has published excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday . world health organization director-general margaret chan has welcomed the pope 's comments , calling them " good news and a good beginning for us , " according to news agency afp . meanwhile , the united nations programme on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- has described benedict 's remarks as " a significant and positive step forward taken by the vatican " to address the spread of hiv , which can be transmitted through unprotected sex . unaids is one of many development organizations devoted to combating the hiv / aids epidemic , which is more widespread in africa than in any other part of the world . a step forward - not a leap many development organization representatives are only cautiously optimistic , however .
in his comments , benedict used male prostitutes as an example of a group for whom the use of condoms could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
but according to paul de lay , unaids ' deputy executive director , this example only affirms the vatican ’ s stance against condoms as a method of contraception . " the example of the male prostitute was probably carefully chosen because it does n't relate to the issue of procreation , " de lay told deutsche welle .
" but we still need to address the issue of heterosexual condom use , which is the main aids issue in africa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern africa is the center of the world aids epidemic what is more , prostitution itself is also a largely heterosexual issue in african countries , where so-called " transactional sex " - sex in exchange for basic necessities such as food - is a common practice , often taking place between " older men and young women , " de lay said . ute stallmeister , spokesperson for the german foundation for world population -lrb- dsw -rrb- , said the pope 's remarks " did not go far enough , " pointing out that " the pope 's statements did n't address the topic of the role of condoms in family planning . " stallmeister said that condoms alone will not solve africa 's aids problem , and that she does not expect dramatic improvements in the global hiv / aids rate due to the pope 's more relaxed stance on condom use . " condoms are important , but not sufficient - the pope is actually right on this point , " she said .
" sexual education is far more important .
how will a woman get a man to wear a condom if she is not educated on the topic herself ? " ' broader dialogue ' expected unaids ' de lay said the value of the pope 's comments lies in their potential to open up debate with the vatican over sexual health . " we have been in dialogue with the catholic church for a long time now , and the condom issue has always been a huge obstacle for us , " said de lay .
" the new position will help us to engage in a broader dialogue . " according to stallmeister , local church representatives in the countries where her organization operates - ethiopia , tanzania , kenya and uganda - have already been acknowledging the benefits of condom use for a long time , despite officially upholding the vatican 's teachings . " while they do n't participate in distributing condoms , they tolerate us doing it , " said stallmeister .
" the aids problem there is so big that many people already realize that something needs to be done .
in that regard , i do n't think the pope 's statement will cause great changes . " condoms are still key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoms are the best way of preventing disease transmission during sex southern africa is the center of the global aids epidemic , with up to 30 percent of the adult population infected in parts of countries including zimbabwe , namibia and south africa . hans stehling , a spokesman for the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , a government-owned organization specializing in technical cooperation for sustainable development , told deutsche welle that the provision of condoms and the promotion of their use is an important part of fighting aids . " focusing exclusively on fidelity and abstinence does not acknowledge the socially and culturally complex life circumstances that do not always allow people to be monogamous and abstinent , " said stehling .
" for these people , condoms are the best protection . " de lay agreed that condoms are the best way of preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases during sexual intercourse . " we have seen condom use has doubled in the last years in some of the most affected countries and we have seen a decline in new infections at the same time , " he said .

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 22.11.2010 swiss slopes may be too pricey for many skiers this season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss ski resorts are worried about empty slopes as ski resorts across the alps gear up for the winter season , resort operators in switzerland are worried about their business .
the swiss franc is strong and could scare away skiers paying in other currencies . despite the global economic worries , swiss ski resort operators still hope to attract plenty of visitors this season .
but they admit it could be challenging .
adding to the cost of what is already an expensive sport is the swiss franc , which has gained in value against the euro , the dollar and the pound .
" it 's very difficult to give a prediction , " said daniel luggen , director of tourism director for zermatt , one of switzerland 's most popular resorts with 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- of ski runs and the glorious matterhorn looming above them .
" will they come ?
will we find people ?
we hope that if we lose german guests , we can attract new ones from russia or maybe even asia . "
safe haven for investors luggen admits that many in switzerland are worried about the future .
" the swiss franc really is a safe haven for many investors , " he said .
" of course , this can be a big advantage for some , but for us in the export industry , it 's a hassle . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong swiss franc is attracting investors but scaring away skiers interest rates in switzerland are practically at zero , giving the swiss national bank little room for maneuver .
earlier this year , the bank tried buying up euros to slow down the rise of the franc .
but the measure was n't especially effective : the euro has been falling again .
bank chairman phillipp hildebrand knows what his responsibility is , but it 's not clear how many tools he has left .
" our mandate is clear : we have to safeguard price stability and work to stay abreast of the current economic climate , so this will determine our fiscal policy in the future , " hildebrand said .
" we will take the necessary measures to ensure price stability .
that is what we have always said and that continues to be our policy . "
difficult winter ahead but already the swiss department of economic affairs is predicting a 1.5 percent drop in tourism income this winter , and switzerland 's director of national tourism , juerg schmid , is warning resorts of icy economic weather ahead .
" we 're going to have to dress up more warmly this winter , if i can put it that way , " he said .
" after this winter , we hope things will get better .
we should expect an upturn by the end of next year , but this winter will be difficult . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn keeps pulling tourists to zermatt so how can the winter resorts minimize the damage ?
some hotels are offering fixed prices in euros with ski passes thrown in .
ski resort operators in zermatt may be able to avoid a big dip in business , thanks to a base of wealthy customers – and the iconic mountain that keeps bringing them back .
" without the matterhorn , zermatt would not have developed as it has , " luggen said .
" after a nice day of skiing , people like to sit on the mountain terrace and look at the matterhorn in the light of the evening sun .
that 's something they do n't forget quickly .
so for me , responsible for marketing zermatt , the matterhorn , is the best thing i have .

but now one ballet dancer is bringing new movement to these solemn ceremonies and finding it can work wonders . georg krawietz was slightly nervous just before the dance performance began in the chapel during his father 's funeral .
the mourners in attendance had never seen anything like it before .
most were over 80 , friends and acquaintances of his dad who died at the age of 88 in a nursing home .
but his nervousness soon faded as the dance got underway .
" i saw that people were interested , and moved , " he said .
" no one there thought that was inappropriate or irreverent . "
four months later , bonn-based dancer felix gruetzner was back in the nursing home 's chapel – this time for the funeral of krawietz 's 85-year-old mother .
he was there to acknowledge the long and full life she had led , but also to express the pain of saying goodbye .
gruetzner does this not through a spoken elegy , but through his body – with soft gestures and restrained movements .
expressing life and loss through dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruetzner at a memorial service in cologne in bare feet and simple , black clothes , gruetzner proceeds up the chapel 's central aisle accompanied by bach 's " cappricio in b-flat . "
at a respectful distance from the coffin , he stretches out his arms , closes his hands into fists , and then pulls them back to his body .
he looks up and down , searchingly , then goes down into a squatting position and makes caressing motions over the ground .
there is where the deceased will find her final resting place , but will it be all that remains ?
in the final part of his dance , gruetzner expresses with his body the transition from death to life - spreading his arms and raising them high .
through movement , he recalls a life not lived in vain , but one that was a precious gift and full of joy .
his face shows the hope for a life beyond death , mourning and tears .
gruetzner , who trained as a dancer , aims to give those in the depth of mourning the courage to embrace life despite the painful loss of a loved one .
" dance can often move people just as much as a good elegy , " he said .
" big emotions are sometimes difficult to capture in words .
dance gives these emotions the space they need . "
according to him , each individual can find his or her interpretation of the dance and find a personal way to mourn , but in the presence of the larger community , which helps in the grieving process .
gruetzner , who originally studied art history , decided to concentrate on dance after working in a publishing house for years .
the 46-year-old was regularly asked to participate in commemorations for the dead in both protestant and catholic churches .
two years ago , he was asked to dance at a large funeral and since then , the requests have kept coming .
" dealing with death and dying all the time is not easy for me either , " he said .
" but life is given new depth and fullness when we face our mortality instead of repressing it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix gruetzner is getting increasing attention for his performances dance of life gruetzner has also learned how helpful and comforting movement can be in times of crisis from the seminars and workshops he offers for people in mourning .
" people who come are often very wound up .
they are often bent over when they walk and their breath is shallow , " he said .
the movement exercises he does with them help counter that , and often lift their spirits .
" mourners often get another perspective on the world all together , " he said .
for him , it 's important that he communicate to his audience the life that he feels waits beyond the veil of death .
he calls his work a dance of life , not of death .
georg krawietz , who asked gruetzner to participate in the funerals of both of his parents , said that he thought gruetzner 's dancing was anything but macabre .
" while watching him dance , i felt not only consoled , but also grounded in my own life , " he said .

but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

he contemplates on how the pilgrimage to mecca has changed his picture of saudi arabia - and talks about his conversations with foreign workers in the country . i 'm sitting among hundreds of thousands of exhausted pilgrims at jeddah airport and i know : it 's all over now .
goodbye to mecca !
thanks for having me .
and i also want to thank all the dw users who cast a critical eye on my journey and posted numerous questions .
your feedback has been a real incitement to my work - and it 's been a lot of fun .
i 'm proud that i was able to reach muslims as well as non-muslims with my diary entries .
by the way , not all of the pilgrims are going home now .
some go on to spend a vacation here , if they can afford it .
many of them stroll along the beaches of the red sea with dark sunglasses .
the hotels are still booked-out .
however , i 'm sitting here at the airport among the many other " flying pilgrims . "
in fact , the rush of people is so heavy that we were asked to be here six hours before departure time .
ex-pilgrims with sunglasses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims at a hotel in jeddah prior to my journey to mecca , i had n't personally met a saudi in my whole life .
i was only familiar with the common prejudices that other arabs like to tell each other about saudis - particularly in yemen , the extremely poor country i come from .
from a yemeni perspective , they easily seem like spoiled " brothers " from a rich neighboring country .
and while saudi arabia has close ties with western countries , it also applies a particularly conservative islamic rule - including whippings and death penalties for violations of the sharia .
my visit was too short to question or change this picture fundamentally .
however , i made some diverging observations that might help to better differentiate between the country 's people and the existing system of government .
all of the saudis that i met in the past days were very friendly - and they were open-minded as well .
let 's take the young men working for the hajj 's organizing committee : all of them had been to college , many of them in foreign countries .
and they all spoke at least three foreign languages .
they love to have fun a lot and spice up their working days with jokes .
at the same time , they 're proud muslims who are very sensitive about utterances associating islam directly or indirectly with extremism or terrorism .
" we utterly reject that , " they say .
" we 're tolerant and open-minded toward non-muslims as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating with multilingual saudi employees of the pilgrim 's office i personally had the feeling that they really meant what they said , and that they were n't just saying it to me because i 'm a journalist from a foreign media company .
however , what about the government 's policies ?
there are a number of facts that can hardly be conveyed to a foreign audience , such as the ban of christian symbols or the exclusion of women from the general public .
what is more , foreigners coming into the country need a saudi resident acting as a guarantor for them .
muhammad is fluent in korean muhammad works for the pilgrimage 's information office as well .
he studied in south korea for five years , where he lived only among locals - he 's fluent in the language .
he still raves about the time in the far east : " koreans are very kind and caring people .
they virtually love foreigners . "
i get the feeling that muhammad was really well-integrated over there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of jiddah these are the moments when you 're sitting in mecca and you 're suddenly reminded of the integration debate going on in germany .
i ask myself : is language really that important when it comes to integration ?
i wonder about that ever since i met bikhiit , a plumber who was hired by a saudi prince only for the days of the hajj .
bikhiit worked on the prince 's luxurious pilgrim 's tent in mecca .
the prince and the plumber bikhiit is from egypt .
aside from his different accent , he 's probably as good in arabic as the saudi prince .
every year , he makes sure that the prince 's pilgrim 's tent is provided with constant warm water .
the sanitary engineer has been working in saudi arabia for 16 years now - but he does n't have a single saudi friend .
" i only consort with saudis during work , " he says .
" i spend the little time off that i have in the evening with my egyptian friends in coffeehouses or watching soccer . "
when i ask him why he 's got no private contacts to locals , he replies : " for example , we egyptians have our own eating habits . "
that 's all i get from him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bikhiit , the plumber of the prince however , he 's very proud of the plumbing job for the saudi prince .
and he 's very grateful to his " normal " saudi employer who allows him to work here during the hajj .
bikhiit likes to live in saudi arabia because he earns more money than in egypt .
but there 's a price to pay for that : he had to give his passport to his employer - as law dictates .
human rights activists argue that this practice establishes a situation of complete dependency .
bikhiit says : " well , at least the passport wo n't get lost . "
his family lives in egypt .
he visits them once a year .
a nepalese in a five star hotel bahadur is a guest worker as well .
he 's from nepal .
the 23-year-old prepares the rooms of a five star hotel and cleans the sanitary installations used by rich pilgrims during the hajj .
" i 'm very happy with the money i make here , " he says .
however , he 's not about to integrate into saudi society .
and nobody has ever asked him to do so , either .
even though the percentage of foreigners living in the kingdom is higher than in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahadur from nepal works in a five star hotel in jeddah i ask a saudi : " is it a problem that few guest workers here speak arabic ? "
" no , " he says - and he obviously does n't quite understand why i would ask him about the language skills of inexpensive foreign workers .
" as long as guest workers do n't consort with people here , that 's not a problem .
besides , many saudis do n't speak english ! "
integration not wanted one of the last people i meet in saudi arabia is faisal , a cab driver from pakistan who takes me to the airport .
i compliment him on his good arabic - but that does n't help him to become socially integrated or to receive a permanent right of residence .
" in the united states and in australia you can become a citizen after five years , " he raves - maybe oversimplifying it a bit .
" but you need to legally live and work in saudi arabia for 20 years in order to get a saudi passport . "
that 's also part of saudi reality : once a guest worker , always a guest worker .
when we part , faisal asks me : " do you have a german passport ? "
" no , " i tell him .
" it 's not that easy to get one .
you first have to legally work and live in germany for 8 years .
there are naturalization tests and you need to have sufficient german language skills .
faisal smiles and i smile back : " at any rate , it 's a lot easier than in saudi arabia . "

the allocation scam is thought to have cost the government over us $ 35 billion . former telecoms minister a. raja , who was forced to resign earlier this month , is alleged to have issued 2g licenses in january 2008 at prices well below market value .
these frequencies are used to transmit phone calls and text messages to mobile phones . " mr clean 's " reputation at risk the controversy has now engulfed prime minister manmohan singh , whose reputation as " mr clean " is at risk , with the supreme court asking him to explain why mr raja has still not been prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the organizers of the commonwealth games in delhi have been arrested " the role of the prime minister is in question , " explained gurudas dasgupta , an mp from the communist party of india , recalling a similar scandal involving an indian stockbroker who is alleged to have engineered a rise in the bombay stock exchange . " in 1991 when the harshad mehta scam came to light , i raised the matter in the rajya sabha -lrb- upper house of parliament -rrb- , " he says .
" our fingers were raised against the finance ministry .
at that time , the finance minister was manmohan singh .
he agreed to a joint parliamentary committee -lrb- jpc -rrb- , even when his role was being questioned .
today , his role as pm is being questioned . " the telecom scam is just one of the current scandals to haunt the government .
the ruling congress was recently forced to sack ashok chavan , chief minister of the important state of maharashtra , after he and other politicians were found to have colluded to obtain luxury flats that were destined for war widows . before that the government had launched a multiple-agency probe into the commonwealth games after fingers were pointed at the chief organizer suresh kalmadi .
two of his aides have already been arrested by anti-corruption investigators . " if you are not part of the oligarchy , you are out " however , the ruling party is not alone to be embroiled in scandal .
the major opposition bharatiya janata party also faces charges , particularly in the southern state of karnataka , whose chief minister , b s yedyurappa , is currently entangled in a land scam . " corruption has made people prosperous through the shorter route , " deplored kiran bedi , one of india ’ s most-celebrated women police officers and a vocal campaigner against corruption . " there is now a cozy relationship between bureaucrats , corporations and politicians – an oligarchic capitalism of corruption .
if you are not part of this oligarchy , you are out of the system , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian communications and information technology minister a. raja was forced to resign earlier this month prime minister has to show " vision " according to transparency international 's corruption perceptions index for 2010 , india has slipped three places to 87 out of 178 this year . though the scandals pose no immediate threat to singh 's government , they are likely to delay the passage of more reform bills . " this is going to continue because the opportunities in india are going to increase , " warned analyst samar harlankar . " in the last 20 years , the receipts to government have grown by more than 10 .
our economy is going to grow and the opportunities are always going to be there .
so this has to be struck at and punishment has to be shown .
the prime minister himself has to get involved .
he has to show vision .

this " city of three rivers " became an important center of trade .
while the fire that destroyed the city in 1662 was tragic , it was the impetus for a stunning baroque reconstruction that continues to serve as a magnet for tourists today .
passau 's many churches and abbeys - there are about 50 of them in the city - give it a special charm .
the diocese of passau once extended all the way to present-day hungary .
a stroll through the streets of the old town is akin to walking through an open-air museum .
but new life pulses behind these baroque facades : today , passau is a hub of art and culture .
the hoellgasse alleyway is now home to a number of artisans , painters , galleries and artists ' studios .
the museum of modern art was at the forefront of the city 's cultural awakening .
it was opened 20 years ago in one of passau 's most beautiful historic buildings .
passau 's old quarter is defined by an abundance of cafes and taverns .
guests can choose from hearty fare to smaller delicacies .
cafe simon creates famous pralines , in shapes that are reminiscent of the ornate golden hats once worn by passau 's wealthy female residents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this " city of three rivers " became an important center of trade .
while the fire that destroyed the city in 1662 was tragic , it was the impetus for a stunning baroque reconstruction that continues to serve as a magnet for tourists today .
passau 's many churches and abbeys - there are about 50 of them in the city - give it a special charm .
the diocese of passau once extended all the way to present-day hungary .
a stroll through the streets of the old town is akin to walking through an open-air museum .
but new life pulses behind these baroque facades : today , passau is a hub of art and culture .
the hoellgasse alleyway is now home to a number of artisans , painters , galleries and artists ' studios .
the museum of modern art was at the forefront of the city 's cultural awakening .
it was opened 20 years ago in one of passau 's most beautiful historic buildings .
passau 's old quarter is defined by an abundance of cafes and taverns .
guests can choose from hearty fare to smaller delicacies .
cafe simon creates famous pralines , in shapes that are reminiscent of the ornate golden hats once worn by passau 's wealthy female residents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 22.11.2010 german base village fears effects of military reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of augustdorf lives here : the rommel military base the german government is set downsize its military by close to 100,000 soldiers .
the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .
military bases in germany will be reduced in size and , in many cases , shut down completely . for the communities where these bases are located , this is grounds for real concern .
in augustdorf , where germany 's largest base is located , a closure would devastate the town .
close to half of its inhabitants live there only because the base is located there . town dependent on military even before entering augustdorf , one has a pretty clear sense that this is bundeswehr country ; here , street signs not only direct the traffic of cars , but also tanks . the dampened sound of gunfire in the distance is the auditory clue that the military is home to this little town on the outskirts of the teutoburg forest - incidentally the site of the ninth century battle of the same name , which is regarded as one of the decisive battles for germanic tribes in their prevention of roman expansion into northern europe . for over 50 years , troops have been stationed and trained at the generalfeldmarschall rommel military base in augustdorf , which currently accounts for 4,000 of the community 's 9,000 people . mayor andreas wulf openly admits that his town lives with - and from - the military base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wulf wo n't lie : his town needs the military base " the bundeswehr , even without the soldiers , is our largest employer and the biggest provider of training , " says wulf as he looks out the window of his city hall office onto the complex in the distance . " the soldiers themselves , they provide augustdorf with over three million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- in revenue through their private purchases alone . " wulf stresses that the consequences of the military reforms could be social just as well as economic ; the five schools and four kindergartens would have to be reduced if the active soldiers were discharged or displaced . businesses face threat in augustdorf 's tattoo parlor , the great majority of esra pollman 's customers are from the rommel military base . " almost every single one was in afghanistan , " says pollman , whose parlor smells of disinfectant spray , akin to the sterile scent of a regular hospital wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers come to pollman for therapy - and more pain " they come to me , pour their hearts out , and let me subject them to more pain , " jokes pollman , adding that " most want the names of their children , but there are some who want provocative symbols like naked women or weapons .
one time , a soldier wanted the entire map of afghanistan on his back ! " when asked what it would mean if the soldiers left , pollmann retained her optimistic spirit : " i am not scared , but , yeah , if the soldiers are moved elsewhere , i doubt i will have any clients . " across the street , at the town snackbar , elke thiem prepares french fries for three soldiers on lunch break .
for her , the situation is similar ; without the soldiers , she would n't really have a business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke thiem fears she will have less customers in future " from the town baker to my french fry shop , it would be really sad around here , " she replies to the same question asked of pollmann . thiem says she fears that augustdorf could face the same problems faced by other communities where military bases have been closed . " they have real problems there : we do n't want that to happen here . " optimism remains the reforms announced at monday 's military conference are scheduled to begin taking effect during the middle of next year . mayor andreas wulf , who has heard rumors of the rommel base being downsized since before the last structural reform in 2004 , says he wo n't give in to any unspecific fears . " in 2004 , -lsb- defense minister peter struck -rsb- said cuts would be made to the bundeswehr base here , but we appealed to parliament and , in the end , we even succeeded in enlarging our base . " however , despite his optimism , wulf does not appear to be as confident this time around . " we do n't know if augustdorf will be affected by these reforms .
in the end , we certainly ca n't count it out . " author : nicolas martin -lrb- glb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the shipping industry is a big producer of co2 emissions , but dutch company cargoshell says it 's found a way to be more environmentally friendly and cut costs at the same time . shipping is a multi-billion euro industry that is expected to grow massively in the next decade .
one of the main concerns of the industry in the current economic climate is not only how to reduce costs but also how to be more environmentally friendly .
according to a 2008 un report , shipping creates double the co2 emissions of the aviation industry . dutch company cargoshell thinks its new , foldable fiberglass cargo containers are the solution to both of these problems .
the company claims they are an innovation compared to the steel shipping containers that have been the industry standard for over 50 years .
cargoshell ceo john houtman said the unique folding design of the glass and resin containers make them perfect for cutting costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargoshell 's containers are foldable , making them space-saving when empty " about 25 percent of all shipments are empty containers , " he said .
" when you collapse an empty cargoshell container , it is just a quarter of the normal size .
so when you transport the containers , you can pile many more empty containers onto one shipment , and that 's better for the environment . " however , cargoshell containers are currently three times more expensive to manufacture than their steel equivalents , raising doubts that shipping operators will be willing to make the initial investment in order to green their business . " i think the product has potential , but if the price is too high , then it raises questions about getting it onto the market , " said sander sprengers , a general manager at cma cgm , the world 's third-biggest container shipping group . price barrier a concern " another concern is that the maintenance and repair costs may also be high , and that the extra handling costs for the manpower needed to fold the containers up and down could be higher than today 's type of operation , " sprengers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completely folded , a cargoshell container can lie flat houtman said his company is aware of the concerns but added they would be minimized if cargoshell containers were to go into large-scale production .
shipping operators should also bear long-term savings in mind , he added . " if you look at the total transporter chain , the cost-saving potential is tremendous , " houtman said .
" a single ship might go from china to rotterdam with 8,000 containers .
our containers weigh 400 kilograms less than metal ones , so in one transport , you get fuel savings of 526,000 euros , not to mention the co2 savings . " cargoshell containers offer a further benefit : they enable the use of radio signals to track the containers ' progress , something that is currently difficult to do with the steel model . " composite is radio neutral - we can track and trace each container from all over the world , " said houtman .
" we can be informed of the status of each container , whether it 's open or closed , what the inside temperature is .
all of this information can be sent to the company . " developers say the cargoshell containers will have a lifespan of 90 years , but it 's the next decade that they 're focusing on at the moment .
the design needs to pass a series of international standard tests to make sure it has the strength and durability of the conventional steel containers .
the results should be known later this year . company hoping for four percent share if it gets the green light , cargoshell hopes to have a million containers in use by 2020 , taking a 4 percent share of the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shipping operators are used to working with steel containers " i think four percent is quite a lot , " said bart kuipers , an economist based at rotterdam 's erasmus university .
" much depends on how serious the shipping companies are about making their operations greener . " kuipers thinks there might be other niche markets for the foldable containers - in the aid and military logistics markets , for example . " think of the problems with a country like afghanistan , which has no ports , and very difficult roads across mountain landscape , " kuipers said .
" i think cargoshell is a very attractive proposition for these kinds of niche markets . " cargoshell launched its revolutionary containers eight months ago , but the first batch of foldable containers has yet to be produced .
still , houtman is encouraged by the initial backing he 's received from major shipping companies , and a high degree of interest in the product from around the world . " we know that some countries , such as australia and belgium , are very interested in the product , and we have received lots of queries from china and india , " houtman said . author : dave goodman -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the shipping industry is a big producer of co2 emissions , but dutch company cargoshell says it 's found a way to be more environmentally friendly and cut costs at the same time . shipping is a multi-billion euro industry that is expected to grow massively in the next decade .
one of the main concerns of the industry in the current economic climate is not only how to reduce costs but also how to be more environmentally friendly .
according to a 2008 un report , shipping creates double the co2 emissions of the aviation industry . dutch company cargoshell thinks its new , foldable fiberglass cargo containers are the solution to both of these problems .
the company claims they are an innovation compared to the steel shipping containers that have been the industry standard for over 50 years .
cargoshell ceo john houtman said the unique folding design of the glass and resin containers make them perfect for cutting costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargoshell 's containers are foldable , making them space-saving when empty " about 25 percent of all shipments are empty containers , " he said .
" when you collapse an empty cargoshell container , it is just a quarter of the normal size .
so when you transport the containers , you can pile many more empty containers onto one shipment , and that 's better for the environment . " however , cargoshell containers are currently three times more expensive to manufacture than their steel equivalents , raising doubts that shipping operators will be willing to make the initial investment in order to green their business . " i think the product has potential , but if the price is too high , then it raises questions about getting it onto the market , " said sander sprengers , a general manager at cma cgm , the world 's third-biggest container shipping group . price barrier a concern " another concern is that the maintenance and repair costs may also be high , and that the extra handling costs for the manpower needed to fold the containers up and down could be higher than today 's type of operation , " sprengers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completely folded , a cargoshell container can lie flat houtman said his company is aware of the concerns but added they would be minimized if cargoshell containers were to go into large-scale production .
shipping operators should also bear long-term savings in mind , he added . " if you look at the total transporter chain , the cost-saving potential is tremendous , " houtman said .
" a single ship might go from china to rotterdam with 8,000 containers .
our containers weigh 400 kilograms less than metal ones , so in one transport , you get fuel savings of 526,000 euros , not to mention the co2 savings . " cargoshell containers offer a further benefit : they enable the use of radio signals to track the containers ' progress , something that is currently difficult to do with the steel model . " composite is radio neutral - we can track and trace each container from all over the world , " said houtman .
" we can be informed of the status of each container , whether it 's open or closed , what the inside temperature is .
all of this information can be sent to the company . " developers say the cargoshell containers will have a lifespan of 90 years , but it 's the next decade that they 're focusing on at the moment .

the country does not have a warning system like those in the uk and the us . one of germany 's most popular tourist attractions , the glass dome of the reichstag in berlin , was closed to tourists on monday following media reports of a plot by islamist extremists to attack the german parliament building .
in several incidents across germany these past days , police cordoned off abandoned packages after what turned out to be false alarms .
on sunday , chancellor angela merkel moved to reassure the population , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that security forces were doing everything in their power to protect the country , just days after the interior minister announced there was a " new security situation " in germany .
it is high time authorities started considering adopting a system of terror warning levels in germany , philipp holtmann , a terrorism expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- told deutsche welle .
code red ? " if we look at the situation we are confronted with right now , we are on the borderline between panicking and hysteria -lsb- on the one hand -rsb- and absolute negligence of the situation -lsb- on the other -rsb- ; people do not know how to estimate the threat that really exists , " he said .
terror alert levels would make it much easier for the population to deal with the threats , holtmann said , because there would be more clarity than there is now : " every hour , we have new reports in the media that give us different scenarios , that tell us different confusing and often contradicting facts , and it would be much easier for the population if there was a clear terror warning alert system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go about your daily life , experts say people can not prevent terrorism , holtmann said , but according to a warning system , people could raise or lower their awareness for things going on around them .
they should continue to keep on living their normal lives but be more alert : " there is no recipe how to do this .
it is not this bag or this person , this language or this culture that needs to be watched , it 's a general awareness , " he said .
in the us , the homeland security advisory system codes threat levels from yellow , or elevated , to red , or severe and accordingly issues warnings to the public .
britain has a system of five threat levels ranging from low to critical .
disagreement over step-by-step warning systems george kassimeris , a senior research fellow in conflict and terrorism at the university of wolverhampton in the uk , said germany would be ill-advised in following the british and us terror alert example .
the systems made sense in theory , he told deutsche welle , but in practice they could be counterproductive : " with all these different levels and colors , the end result is a certain degree of panic , confusion and anxiety among the population because the population are not in possession of the knowledge and information the intelligence services are when they issue all these different warnings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the police prepared ?
the intelligence services , the british expert said , would never notify the public in advance of an imminent terror threat because if they did , they would be giving the game away to the terrorists .
" ordinary people can do absolutely nothing about it " kassimeris said that at first , people heed terror warnings , but at some point , they stop paying attention because they make no difference to their lives .
terrorism has become a part of our lives , kassimeris said , and it is bound to continue to be a part of our lives because there will always be people who resort to violence to advance their fanatical beliefs .
" the population can not possibly be prepared , " according to kassimeris - but the intelligence and security agencies can . the debate should not be about whether the public was prepared , he said , but whether the security services who are responsible for protecting people 's safety are prepared to the very maximum to deal with the threat .

but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

politicians warned that some dangers were being overstated . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has said that security agencies are working to prevent a possible terror attack , but he criticized news organizations for their reporting on the threat , saying it was a danger in its own right .
speaking on a german news talk show on sunday evening , de maiziere took pains to distance himself from " irresponsible speculation " about terror threats published by weekly news magazine der spiegel and other news outlets .
after de maiziere had given a terror warning earlier in the week , der spiegel reported that al-qaeda operatives were planning a bloody hostage-taking attack on the reichstag , in berlin , before the end of november .
the reichstag is the seat of german parliament .
on monday , the glassed-in cupola of the reichstag - a favorite tourist destination - was closed to the public , although pre-arranged group tours were still taking place .
closing the reichstag but on sunday , de maiziere warned , " speculation has a psychological effect in itself .
it also spreads fear . "
he assured the public that the government is " taking the threat seriously , without being completely sure " about what the threat is , or when an attack would be expected .
the government 's terror warning on wednesday was reportedly based on internal sources .
der spiegel cited a jihadist who contacted the german authorities , as well as data from foreign intelligence sources , including the fbi .
the interior ministry has not issued denials on the sources of the reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere has said the security forces can not guarantee absolute safety other conservative politicians jumped on the message of warning against spreading panic over the terror threats as well .
on sunday , christian democrat home affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told the bild newspaper that : " we need the right balance between alertness and calm , and we should n't change our daily lives . "
he said the likelihood of having a traffic accident was higher than of being the victim of a terror attack , adding " nonetheless i get into my car , a bus or a train every day . "
increased security measures for his part , de maiziere told moderator will that there was " no answer to how we have to act so as to completely avoid terrorism , " nor was there any point in trying to placate terrorists .
" if we do what terrorists tell us - like immediately withdraw from afghanistan , or introduce sharia law in germany , … even that might not stop them .
we have to behave how we see fit . "
de maiziere 's warning on wednesday led to increased security at airports and train stations across germany .
for the few weeks prior to the alert , he had repeatedly played down a number of reports and warnings from the us about possible terrorist assaults in europe .
germany has not been hit by a major islamist terror attack in the past decade , although there have been a number of planned attacks which were prevented or which failed .
but german troops ' engagement in afghanistan has brought the country closer to the attention of islamic radicals . but now , german police say , the danger of an islamist terrorist attack in germany has never been more specific .
the head of the german police force , matthias seeger , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper that there have been a number of tip-offs from different sources .
on tuesday , a parliamentary committee will be holding a special session to discuss the current threat level , christian democrat lawmaker stefan mueller told dpa news agency .

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else . " meanwhile , google remains under investigation in germany , spain , italy , canada and the us . author : cyrus farivar editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.11.2010 ex-amateur coaches at stuttgart , cologne face uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank schaefer took over cologne in late october in jens keller and frank schaefer respectively , stuttgart and cologne hope that an in-house promotion will turn the tide .
but former amateur coaches seldom have long-term success in the bundesliga . cologne 's 1-0 victory over stuttgart on sunday , which resulted from a disputed penalty , was nothing for the scrapbooks , but for coach frank schaefer what mattered were the three points .
" this was the reaction that we wanted and that we worked for , " schaefer , whose side had been destroyed at home by local rivals moenchengladbach the week before , told reporters after the match .
replacing an unsuccessful head coach with the coach of a developmental squad is a trick many bundesliga teams have tried over the years .
promoting someone from inside the organization , so the reasoning , will inspire players with an example of club loyalty and has the advantage that the new man in charge already knows the squad and the environs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has steered stuttgart to two wins , two losses and a draw such was the case at cologne in the mid-1980s , when christoph daum rose through the ranks .
but does the move usually work ?
history suggests it usually does n't .
of the 17 first-division coaches in germany , only three worked their way up from developmental and youth sides .
there are , however , a few shining exceptions .
the schaaf scenario in 1999 , werder bremen were at a crossroads .
it had been five years since their last title , and the northern germans were battling relegation and had run through a series of coaches , including felix magath .
the reins were handed over to amateur skipper thomas schaaf .
what appeared to be a desperate throw of the dice turned out to be a stroke of personnel genius .
bremen not only survived 1999 , but won the german cup .
schaaf has gone on to become the bundesliga 's longest-standing coach , and bremen 's record of success in the past decade is second only to bayern munich 's .
bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf is a hero and icon in bremen one key to the turn-around was the appointment of klaus allofs as sports director .
he not only put together the deals that led to further bremen titles .
he also ensured that schaaf 's position was secure enough for him to do his job .
thomas tuchel - who took over mainz shortly before the start of last season - also fits into the schaaf mold of a former player working his way up the ranks of a club and having success with the full backing of management .
jens keller and frank schaefer are stuttgart and cologne born-and-bred so the identification factor is there .
but they work for powder-keg clubs where coaches are expected to produce immediate results .
and even results , as history shows , do n't ensure job security .
the doll dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll had a mercurial rise and fall in hamburg bundesliga history is littered with stories of amateur coaches being promoted to the first team , only to disappear back into obscurity .
even those who do engineer turnarounds seldom last long .
in october 2004 , thomas doll , a former forward for hamburg and coach of its development side , was bumped up after the northern german giants had dropped to last place .
he led hamburg to a place in international competition in 2005 .
" dolly , " as he was known , was everybody 's darling , but not for long .
he was fired early in 2007 , after hamburg had only earned 15 points in 19 matches .
subsequent engagements in dortmund and turkey were likewise short-lived .
doll is currently without a job .
the story is similar with falko goetz at hertha berlin and , to an extent , with mirko slomka at schalke - slomka was axed even through the average points the royal blues earned per game under his tenure was second only to bayern .
at big clubs with heralded pasts and commensurate expectations , a former amateur coach must struggle with perceptions that he is , perhaps , not really cut of big-league cloth .
stuttgart are three-time german champions .
so are cologne , and although their last league title came way back in 1978 , they think of themselves as part of germany 's footballing elite .
both stuttgart and cologne are in the relegation zone , and keller and schaefer will have to make their names in a hurry .
otherwise , like so many of their predecessors , they 'll be quickly shown the door .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 22.11.2010 opinion : is nato withdrawal from afghanistan by 2014 realistic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato confirmed at its summit in lisbon that it wanted to pull out of afghanistan by the end of 2014 , leaving the afghan security forces in control .
but deutsche welle 's ratbil shamel is skeptical about this aim . right now , the afghan police and army are not capable of rising to the task .
they lack personnel , suitable weapons and adequate training .
moreover , the loyalty of afghan soldiers and police is questionable .
many are former mujahedeen and they still seem devoted to their erstwhile leaders at times .
the deplorable state that afghanistan ’ s police and army are in is proof that nato has failed in its efforts to train them up .
a further security risk is the fact that drug abuse among young members of the police and army is rife .
finally , according to observers , the taliban 's influence on the afghan security forces is growing . nonetheless , the nato leaders at their summit in lisbon were optimistic about the future .
the general gist was that these problems could be solved .
they said that training and equipping the afghan army and police would be a top priority over the next few years .
the member states made clear they all wanted to boost efforts to prepare the afghan security forces for the task ahead .
what was new was the confirmation that nato will not abandon the afghans to themselves even if it does pull out .
chancellor angela merkel said there would still be german soldiers in afghanistan after 2014 . for the afghans , nato 's resolution is clearly motivated by domestic politics .
the idea is to placate voters in member states who are less and less supportive of nato 's operation in afghanistan , especially if it does not have a clear end .
while the afghans are supposed to understand that the nato states will not give up on them .
nobody wants the history books of the future to say that the biggest military alliance of all times failed in its ambitious reconstruction project in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratbil shamel is the head of deutsche welle 's afghan department however , anybody who thinks the security issues will be solved by handing over responsibility to the already weak afghan authorities and security forces is in for an unpleasant shock .
although president karzai is the greatest advocate of nato plans to withdraw because he is intent on showing how patriotic and independent he is , most afghans doubt the army and police will acquire the strength that is necessary to replace the nato troops over the next three years .
they are right to ask how something that did not take place in the past nine years is now supposed to take place … nato has not provided any clear ideas so far , but the alliance ’ s defence ministers will have to speak up soon .
they know that they can not fail in afghanistan – this would strengthen international islamist terrorism not only in the hindu kush region but all over the world . author : ratbil shamel -lrb- act -rrb- editor : priya esselborn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

'
limited background information on the pirates could hamper the case . the first pirate trial to take place in germany in 400 years has opened in hamburg .
more than seven months after the attack on the hamburg-registered container ship ms taipan , 10 somali men are standing trial .
they are charged with attacking the ship some 900 kilometers -lrb- 560 miles -rrb- east of the somali coast in april .
one of the defendants has told the court that he was 13 years old at the time of the attack , which would mean he could not be tried under german law .
experts in the court believe he is likely 15 or older ; however , with little reliable documentation on the youngster , this could be difficult to prove .
" a child should not be obliged to stand in court , if his given age of 13 is correct , " the chair of the judging panel , bernd steinmetz said .
the eldest accused said he was 48 , while the other eight all stated ages between 16 and 28 ; but none of them could give his precise date of birth .
the accused have been communicating via interpreters , as they do n't speak german .
possible sentences between 10 and 15 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taipan was freed by dutch marines nobody was injured when the taipan vessel was taken hostage in april .
the ship 's 15-man crew fled to a safety room when the pirates boarded their ship , and the pirates were eventually captured by dutch naval forces .
the alleged pirates were extradited to germany in june .
since then , they have been in custody awaiting trial .
the defendants could get sentences of anywhere from 10 to 15 years in prison if found guilty .
the prosecution says it has evidence that the men were in possession of kalashnikov rifles , grenade launchers , knives and ladders for boarding ships .
the team of 20 defense lawyers jointly appealed to the court to consider the circumstances in somalia , an all-but lawless country racked by two decades of civil war , where they said life was marked by hunger , terror and a lack of medicine .
" the somali people are suffering ; there is no possibility of fleeing within the country , " the lawyers argued .
piracy is a growing problem off the coast of somalia , with both the number of attacks and the ransoms demanded spiking over the past two years , the london-based international maritime bureau told afp news service .
some 23 vessels and 500 crew are currently held by somali pirates , the bureau said .

the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .
military bases in germany will be reduced in size and , in many cases , shut down completely . for the communities where these bases are located , this is grounds for real concern .
in augustdorf , where germany 's largest base is located , a closure would devastate the town .
close to half of its inhabitants live there only because the base is located there . town dependent on military even before entering augustdorf , one has a pretty clear sense that this is bundeswehr country ; here , street signs not only direct the traffic of cars , but also tanks . the dampened sound of gunfire in the distance is the auditory clue that the military is home to this little town on the outskirts of the teutoburg forest - incidentally the site of the ninth century battle of the same name , which is regarded as one of the decisive battles for germanic tribes in their prevention of roman expansion into northern europe . for over 50 years , troops have been stationed and trained at the generalfeldmarschall rommel military base in augustdorf , which currently accounts for 4,000 of the community 's 9,000 people . mayor andreas wulf openly admits that his town lives with - and from - the military base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wulf wo n't lie : his town needs the military base " the bundeswehr , even without the soldiers , is our largest employer and the biggest provider of training , " says wulf as he looks out the window of his city hall office onto the complex in the distance . " the soldiers themselves , they provide augustdorf with over three million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- in revenue through their private purchases alone . " wulf stresses that the consequences of the military reforms could be social just as well as economic ; the five schools and four kindergartens would have to be reduced if the active soldiers were discharged or displaced . businesses face threat in augustdorf 's tattoo parlor , the great majority of esra pollman 's customers are from the rommel military base . " almost every single one was in afghanistan , " says pollman , whose parlor smells of disinfectant spray , akin to the sterile scent of a regular hospital wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers come to pollman for therapy - and more pain " they come to me , pour their hearts out , and let me subject them to more pain , " jokes pollman , adding that " most want the names of their children , but there are some who want provocative symbols like naked women or weapons .
one time , a soldier wanted the entire map of afghanistan on his back ! " when asked what it would mean if the soldiers left , pollmann retained her optimistic spirit : " i am not scared , but , yeah , if the soldiers are moved elsewhere , i doubt i will have any clients . " across the street , at the town snackbar , elke thiem prepares french fries for three soldiers on lunch break .
for her , the situation is similar ; without the soldiers , she would n't really have a business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke thiem fears she will have less customers in future " from the town baker to my french fry shop , it would be really sad around here , " she replies to the same question asked of pollmann . thiem says she fears that augustdorf could face the same problems faced by other communities where military bases have been closed . " they have real problems there : we do n't want that to happen here . " optimism remains the reforms announced at monday 's military conference are scheduled to begin taking effect during the middle of next year . mayor andreas wulf , who has heard rumors of the rommel base being downsized since before the last structural reform in 2004 , says he wo n't give in to any unspecific fears .

the reform wo n't only affect soldiers , however ; many communities that are home to bases , like augustdorf , fear they will be downsized , too . german military commanders and politicians , including chancellor angela merkel and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , were convening in dresden on monday for an annual military conference that was expected to pass sweeping reforms that will see the bundeswehr drastically restructured - and reduced . in the run up to monday 's conference , guttenberg reiterated his stance on the necessity of military reforms , saying " all analyses show that the bundeswehr is at a point where profound changes must be made ; merely cosmetic revisions will not get the job done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars go straight through , tanks turn left and right the restructuring , according to defense ministry plans , means , above all , downsizing the military , from 250,000 to around 165,000 troops .
military bases in germany will be reduced in size and , in many cases , shut down completely . for the communities where these bases are located , this is grounds for real concern .
in augustdorf , where germany 's largest base is located , a closure would devastate the town .
close to half of its inhabitants live there only because the base is located there . town dependent on military even before entering augustdorf , one has a pretty clear sense that this is bundeswehr country ; here , street signs not only direct the traffic of cars , but also tanks . the dampened sound of gunfire in the distance is the auditory clue that the military is home to this little town on the outskirts of the teutoburg forest - incidentally the site of the ninth century battle of the same name , which is regarded as one of the decisive battles for germanic tribes in their prevention of roman expansion into northern europe . for over 50 years , troops have been stationed and trained at the generalfeldmarschall rommel military base in augustdorf , which currently accounts for 4,000 of the community 's 9,000 people . mayor andreas wulf openly admits that his town lives with - and from - the military base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wulf wo n't lie : his town needs the military base " the bundeswehr , even without the soldiers , is our largest employer and the biggest provider of training , " says wulf as he looks out the window of his city hall office onto the complex in the distance . " the soldiers themselves , they provide augustdorf with over three million euros -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- in revenue through their private purchases alone . " wulf stresses that the consequences of the military reforms could be social just as well as economic ; the five schools and four kindergartens would have to be reduced if the active soldiers were discharged or displaced . businesses face threat in augustdorf 's tattoo parlor , the great majority of esra pollman 's customers are from the rommel military base . " almost every single one was in afghanistan , " says pollman , whose parlor smells of disinfectant spray , akin to the sterile scent of a regular hospital wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers come to pollman for therapy - and more pain " they come to me , pour their hearts out , and let me subject them to more pain , " jokes pollman , adding that " most want the names of their children , but there are some who want provocative symbols like naked women or weapons .
one time , a soldier wanted the entire map of afghanistan on his back ! " when asked what it would mean if the soldiers left , pollmann retained her optimistic spirit : " i am not scared , but , yeah , if the soldiers are moved elsewhere , i doubt i will have any clients . " across the street , at the town snackbar , elke thiem prepares french fries for three soldiers on lunch break .
for her , the situation is similar ; without the soldiers , she would n't really have a business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke thiem fears she will have less customers in future " from the town baker to my french fry shop , it would be really sad around here , " she replies to the same question asked of pollmann . thiem says she fears that augustdorf could face the same problems faced by other communities where military bases have been closed . " they have real problems there : we do n't want that to happen here . " optimism remains the reforms announced at monday 's military conference are scheduled to begin taking effect during the middle of next year . mayor andreas wulf , who has heard rumors of the rommel base being downsized since before the last structural reform in 2004 , says he wo n't give in to any unspecific fears . " in 2004 , -lsb- defense minister peter struck -rsb- said cuts would be made to the bundeswehr base here , but we appealed to parliament and , in the end , we even succeeded in enlarging our base . " however , despite his optimism , wulf does not appear to be as confident this time around . " we do n't know if augustdorf will be affected by these reforms .

there were no details released on the cause of death .
in july , kunz was indicted by a german court of actually killing 10 people himself and helping murder some 430,000 during his time as a trainee and guard at the ss trawniki and belzec death camps .
he was at those camps from january 1942 through july 1943 .
both were located in then-occupied poland .
involved in the whole camp process in the indictment , prosecutors said kunz was involved in the entire process of killing jews , from taking victims from trains to pushing them into gas chambers to throwing corpses into mass graves .
the 89-year-old kunz died shortly before his trial , which was set to begin at the bonn district court in early 2011 .
the case has been discontinued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of john demjanjuk is a high-profile one " samuel kunz died on november 18 at 5:30 p.m. , most likely at his home " in germany , prosecutor andreas brendel , head of the central nazi war crimes investigation unit , told afp .
" we have the death certificate . "
change in nazi-hunting policy kunz was third on the wiesenthal center 's most-wanted list of nazi war criminals .
he lived near bonn , and was employed up until his retirement as a handyman in the federal ministry of building and urban development .
the ex-guard had long been ignored by the german justice system , since until recently authorities showed little interest in going after relatively low-ranking camp guards .
in what nazi hunters say is a welcome change in policy , the past 10 years has seen a revival in interest in pursuing all those suspected in holocaust involvement , regardless of rank .
the case against kunz came about after he was investigated in connection with the accused nazi war criminal john demjanjuk , in munich .
efraim zuroff , the wiesenthal center 's top nazi hunter , told afp he found it " incredibly frustrating " that kunz died before trial .
but he added it was important that he had been indicted at all .
" at least a small measure of justice was achieved , " zuroff said .

while the us still hopes to bring both sides back to the table , analysts fear that another peace effort has failed . when us secretary of state hillary clinton and israeli prime minister benjamin netanjahu - after an eight-hour meeting two weeks ago - issued a terse statement promising that they " will work closely together in the coming days " to try to rejuvenate the stalled peace talks , it seemed to confirm what many experts had been arguing all along . " there 's a funeral going on , but the coffin has n't been brought in yet , " amjad atallah , co-director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation , told deutsche welle , when asked whether the current peace process between israelis and palestinians is dead .
and indeed , the direct peace talks between both parties which were initiated in washington on september 1 lasted for all but three weeks .
but they have now been on ice for almost two months .
talks collapsed after an israeli building freeze ended and palestinians vowed to resume talks only after a new construction stop was put in place .
since then , the conditions for a resumption of negotiations have only deteriorated .
in early november , israel announced a massive new building plan only to be told by president barack obama that these efforts were not helpful to move the peace talks forward .
since then there have been rumors that us middle east envoy george mitchell was going to be replaced as well as various efforts to get the peace talks back on track via third parties .
all without tangible results .
flawed process but many political observers have lost confidence in the entire mechanism . " i think even the concept of middle east peace process for us who have been following the last 20 years of negotiations does not make any sense anymore , " alvaro de vasconcelos , director of the eu institute for security studies , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : israel 's decision to end the buidling freeze caused the current impasse " so the challenge for us right now is to ask what 's different this time that would make us believe that if we put the israelis and the palestinians in a room together and lock the door that they would come out with a mutually agreed upon deal that did n't have international pressure or did n't have any international involvement , " asks atallah .
he believes that the obama administration actually started out on the right track : " it started out like gangbusters , " says atallah .
" it was actually going to end this .
it recognized that israel 's settlement activity was a very prejudicial activity and demanded that it end . "
but then , adds atallah , " the president 's team on its own decided that the pressure it was putting on israel was unsustainable and then capitulated without getting anything in return . "
that switch according to atallah puts the entire peace process at stake , because " the only reason the united states is a broker in this issue is because of the assumption that the united states can deliver israel . "
the recurring problem of this process and past negotiations lies in its gradual nature of small steps , argues vasconcelos : " that means that a spoiler will spoil it and the spoiler can be the israelis or the palestinians .
we have seen this time and time again . "
role to play for the eu the lesson of the past experiences with the middle east peace process for vasconcelos is that " building a palestinian state bottom-up does n't go anywhere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a hopeful start , events soon took a turn for the worse instead , he favors a concerted effort by the international community , led by the us and supported by the eu : " to enforce a solution and create a kind of dayton agreement for the middle east . "
his colleague atallah is not convinced that this top-down approach will achieve better results : " the dayton accords where not a pretty way to end the bosnian war and right now we are facing the consequences of it . "
but atallah does believe that europe needs to become more active to advance peace in the middle east even if it is too late this time around .
" europe definitely has a role to play , but it 's a question of to be or not to be .
if europe chooses to play only an adjunct role to the united states saying tell us what to do and we will do it , then europe has chosen for itself not to play a role . "

german fascination with british royalty both grandiose and banal do you thing there is too much hype about the wedding ?
i enjoyed your article on the interest in the wedding of prince william and kate middleton .
i have always thought there was a certain interest by germans in the british royals because of their german heritage .
the house of saxe-coburg und gotha is essentially the house of windsor , with prince andreas as the current head of the family .
do you think this is well known in germany ?
and if so , could it explain the fascination exhibited with the british royal family ? - philip , australia why is germany all of a sudden so preoccupied with royals ?
even though , as the article does state , there 's no ' official ' royal court in germany , the descendants of the royal lineage are many and scattered all over the globe .
so , i will pose a question then , do you really wish us to come back ?
will you all welcome us with opened arms ?
will you give us our ancestral land properties ?
really , where will you fit nearly 82 million more people ? - melani , canada i will sound in with a resounding ' yes ' to this question .
and as this event is still a ways off , one can only speculate how the media will go into overdrive as the date draws nearer .
i think -lrb- at least to some degree -rrb- there will always be a fascination with ' royalty ' and how the ' other half ' lives .
but at the end of the day we 're still left with two ' ordinary ' people who will be facing whatever lies ahead . - graham , canada are n't they part german in ancestry , or did i dream that ?
it makes sense germans should be interested . - d. , us well , it is a bit silly for germans to care about the british monarchy , but i suppose it is as silly as the british caring about the british monarchy ... so if the brits like having a monarchy , let them have one , and if the germans like being interested in the british monarchy , let them be .
i mean if people were n't so interested in this wedding they would probably be reading something equally silly , like angelina jolie adopting another baby or paul mccartney divorcing for the 12th time ; the real question is why do we care about the lives of celebrities ?
but apart from that , let them have their fun , i suppose . - eduardo via facebook royal family announces prince william 's engagement to kate middleton was it a foregone conclusion that prince william and kate middleton would get engaged ?
nothing is inevitable when it comes to matters of love , but in this case , i 'm glad the prince 's heart matched the hopes and best wishes his subjects around the world had for him and his bride-to-be . - lisa , australia no , i do n't think anyone could say it was a foregone conclusion , probable comes to mind .
love , compatibility and friendship are musts in the kind of work they will be called upon to do , and it could be said that she has already had a good exposure to the various facets of the job .
i think it is a good thing that prince william has been able to follow his heart , just as prince frederick of denmark did with princess mary , who indeed had a more compressed training , but we australians like to think she is doing a good job . - lois , australia as a republican i could not care less .
the sooner australia becomes a republic and finally shakes the shackles of great britain the better for all .

the allocation scam is thought to have cost the government over us $ 35 billion . former telecoms minister a. raja , who was forced to resign earlier this month , is alleged to have issued 2g licenses in january 2008 at prices well below market value .
these frequencies are used to transmit phone calls and text messages to mobile phones . " mr clean 's " reputation at risk the controversy has now engulfed prime minister manmohan singh , whose reputation as " mr clean " is at risk , with the supreme court asking him to explain why mr raja has still not been prosecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the organizers of the commonwealth games in delhi have been arrested " the role of the prime minister is in question , " explained gurudas dasgupta , an mp from the communist party of india , recalling a similar scandal involving an indian stockbroker who is alleged to have engineered a rise in the bombay stock exchange . " in 1991 when the harshad mehta scam came to light , i raised the matter in the rajya sabha -lrb- upper house of parliament -rrb- , " he says .
" our fingers were raised against the finance ministry .
at that time , the finance minister was manmohan singh .
he agreed to a joint parliamentary committee -lrb- jpc -rrb- , even when his role was being questioned .
today , his role as pm is being questioned . " the telecom scam is just one of the current scandals to haunt the government .
the ruling congress was recently forced to sack ashok chavan , chief minister of the important state of maharashtra , after he and other politicians were found to have colluded to obtain luxury flats that were destined for war widows . before that the government had launched a multiple-agency probe into the commonwealth games after fingers were pointed at the chief organizer suresh kalmadi .
two of his aides have already been arrested by anti-corruption investigators . " if you are not part of the oligarchy , you are out " however , the ruling party is not alone to be embroiled in scandal .
the major opposition bharatiya janata party also faces charges , particularly in the southern state of karnataka , whose chief minister , b s yedyurappa , is currently entangled in a land scam . " corruption has made people prosperous through the shorter route , " deplored kiran bedi , one of india ’ s most-celebrated women police officers and a vocal campaigner against corruption . " there is now a cozy relationship between bureaucrats , corporations and politicians – an oligarchic capitalism of corruption .
if you are not part of this oligarchy , you are out of the system , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian communications and information technology minister a. raja was forced to resign earlier this month prime minister has to show " vision " according to transparency international 's corruption perceptions index for 2010 , india has slipped three places to 87 out of 178 this year . though the scandals pose no immediate threat to singh 's government , they are likely to delay the passage of more reform bills . " this is going to continue because the opportunities in india are going to increase , " warned analyst samar harlankar . " in the last 20 years , the receipts to government have grown by more than 10 .
our economy is going to grow and the opportunities are always going to be there .
so this has to be struck at and punishment has to be shown .

but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .

the information commissioner 's office says it is " very pleased , " but experts remain skeptical . google has agreed to delete private data , such as fragments of e-mails and passwords mistakenly picked up from open wireless networks in britain by its street view cars , british information commissioner christopher graham has revealed . the us-based online giant has also promised to improve data protection training for its employees and create a privacy document for every new project it launches . in a statement published on the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- website last friday , graham added that he is " very pleased to have a firm commitment from google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information . " " i welcome the fact that the wifi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can , at last , be deleted , " he said . google has been under investigation in the uk since the ico re-opened an investigation in october .
prior to that , google had been cleared of having collected " meaningful personal details , " but that case was brought back once google revealed more details about the type of data it had collected . earlier this month , the ico had found that google was guilty of a " significant breach of the data protection act , " but that it would not seek monetary damages as it would have been too legally difficult to prove . ico influence remains weak , experts say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk experts think google 's policies will improve over time however , academic internet experts remain unmoved by the influence of the ico and google 's agreement to delete captured data in the uk , pointing out that the company has already promised to do the same in several other countries . for viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor at the oxford internet institute in the uk , the most important outcome of the conflict is google 's promise to improve data protection training for its employees and create more privacy documents in the future . " i think this is perhaps the biggest impact of that decision – as with such new procedures google 's behavior will eventually mature , " mayer-schoenberger told deutsche welle .
" it will take much longer , however , for the public to change its -lrb- negative -rrb- view on google . " other internet scholars add that even if the ico does n't have a strong bite , german privacy regulation will continue to set the standard across europe . " the information commissioner is ineffective and is widely held in contempt , " said ross anderson , a professor of computer science at cambridge university .
" he inspires no trust from data subjects and no fear from the companies he 's supposed to regulate .
i do believe that google will pay more attention to privacy in the future , but the uk ico 's actions wo n't be a factor in that . " " the german authorities will have much more influence , and indeed google now does its privacy research in munich , " he added .
" they know that if they can sell their privacy policies there , they will work everywhere else . " meanwhile , google remains under investigation in germany , spain , italy , canada and the us . author : cyrus farivar editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 22.11.2010 deutsche bank goes to vegas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money , money , money makes vegas go round come mid-december , las vegas will be one casino richer and the deutsche bank will have officially planted a large and very expensive foot in the nevada desert .
but do banking and gambling make a happy marriage ? if the $ 4 billion hotel-cum-casino 's advertising slogan is to be believed , the brand new 3,000 bed cosmopolitan is " just the right amount of wrong . "
it has been pipped as one of the most expensive projects ever in the history of vegas and , judging by its promotional pictures , is a place of grandiose luxury .
but visitors to the complex might be more comfortable in one of its almost 3,000 beds than deutsche bank appears to be in its own .
in declining to make any official comment relating to its desert foray , the mighty german financier lends weight to the idea that the amount of wrong is , in fact , not quite right .
in fairness , the bank did not actually set out to be put its name on the strip , or at least not so boldly .
the venture started in the hands of a developer , ian bruce eichner , who convinced the big lender to stump up $ 1 billion for his dream casino .
at the time , the term global financial crisis had not yet been coined .
but it came , wrought havoc and rendered eichner unable to meet his loan payments .
the only way out was a forced sale .
cutting losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : place your bets please ...
rather than let the construction - little more than a shell at the time - be sold off for a song and thereby walk away from the situation out of pocket , deutsche bank went along to the auction and came away with a half-built casino in need or financial commitment far exceeding the original loan .
it was , and remains , a risk , but expert martin ruckes told deutsche welle that such action is quite common when debtors default on their payments .
" it 's all about minimizing losses , " he said .
" it can make sense to become the outright owner for a while until the market environment has picked up and the object can be sold for a profit . "
bad timing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new casino has 1474 slot machines and 83 gambling tables exactly when that might be in the case of the cosmopolitan is impossible to judge , and deutsche bank is certainly not hazarding a guess on record .
fact is that the nevada town has been struggling to keep a stronghold on its popularity in recent years .
where it was once synonymous with affluence and decadence , the gambling capital of america is now gaining notoriety as a microcosm of economic woe .
not only have the nation 's casino-lovers had less to spend on roulette and the like since the financial downturn , but when they do gamble , they are now more likely to do it closer to home at one of the country 's hundreds of native indian casinos .
but even if the cosmopolitan proves to be a poorly-timed venture , ruckes says it is not one that will break the bank .
" with real-estate , you have the land and the building , so you 're not talking total loss , " he said .
" and long-term casinos are a relatively low-risk sector . "
looking for a buyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coldplay could help to put the cosmopolitan on the map that is what the cosmopolitan , which is not going to be operated by deutsche bank , is putting its money on .
that , and the fresh life it hopes the two-tower development will breathe into a stale scene .
the casino 's chief executive , john unwin , told the wall street journal that he expected people to want to come and see it " because it is truly something different . "
it 's not only different from existing establishments such as caesars palace , but also from the original plans as laid out by eichner .
his visions of giant-sized robots and leopard-skin print wallpaper have been replaced by sleek glitz , glamour and glass .
and just days after opening on december 15 , the casino will host a grand new year 's eve party with guests jay z and coldplay providing the entertainment .
it promises to be a big night and , deutsche bank hopes , one of many more to come .
the sooner it is a success , the sooner it can be sold off and the respectable frankfurt financial house can return to the business of respectability .
