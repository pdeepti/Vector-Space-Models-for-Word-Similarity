cologne 's lukas podolski , who formerly played with bayern munich , set his opponents up for defeat when his direct goal kick 32 minutes in passed goalie hans-jorg butt 's hands and gave cologne the lead .
but schweinsteiger 's rescue in the 58th minute kept the bavarians at the top of the bundesliga with 53 points from 25 games .

late-game goals werder bremen made a last-minute comeback by scoring two goals in the final 15 minutes against stuttgart , tying their opponents 2-2 , and wolfsburg quashed early fears of losing at home to bochum when they scored four goals in the final half hour , ending with a comfortable 4-1 victory .
hanover managed to move just above the relegation zone after beating fellow strugglers freiburg 2-1 , and hertha berlin remained stuck at the bottom of the table after a 1-0 loss at hamburg .

" there are cases that have not played out as they should have , " she told munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" if it were up to me , germany would n't have any statute of limitations at all , like in switzerland . "
merk said the trauma of sexual abuse is incomparable to that of other crimes , and called for a " minimum " 30-year period after the abuse is committed for prosecutors to bring charges against the abuser .
meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .
" especially for cases in which criminal prosecution is no longer possible , a round-table discussion can open a dialogue on the legitimate concerns of the victims , " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
new revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school 's current principal called the failure to report the crimes " a great mistake " amid the ongoing sex abuse scandal in german churches , allegations of past abuse also arose at an elite private school in the state of hesse .
the school , called odenwaldschule , released a statement through its web site friday saying two students had come forward claiming they were abused by the former school principal between 1975 and 1980 .
the school has since admitted there are reports of more than 20 victims , and that at least three teachers were involved in the abuse .
ex-pupils at the school have told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau the number of victims lies between 50 and 100 .
" it was a failure and a great mistake that the school did n't look into these allegations , " current principal margarita kaufmann told frankfurter rundschau. acb / epd / apn / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .
but if the sum is over a million euros , the court ruled that the sentence should not be suspended . " costly honesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inspectors can rule out a voluntary declaration if the tax payer is already under investigation faced with the real prospect of jail , it 's not surprising that people are flocking to make self-declarations .
but this is obviously also very costly .
in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .
as a taxpayer , you should really think carefully about that . " and there is another factor that may weigh heavily on those with hidden swiss fortunes : the political pressure is already growing to get rid of the voluntary amnesty option altogether . author : ben knight editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .

anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .

to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .
but if the sum is over a million euros , the court ruled that the sentence should not be suspended . " costly honesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inspectors can rule out a voluntary declaration if the tax payer is already under investigation faced with the real prospect of jail , it 's not surprising that people are flocking to make self-declarations .
but this is obviously also very costly .
in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .
as a taxpayer , you should really think carefully about that . " and there is another factor that may weigh heavily on those with hidden swiss fortunes : the political pressure is already growing to get rid of the voluntary amnesty option altogether . author : ben knight editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 .

" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

while polls show a majority feel the country is ethically bound to pay back some of the money lost through icesave ’ s collapse , the current bill is widely seen as unreasonable . " the people who own the banks win when they make money , but when they lose the debt is -lrb- pushed off -rrb- on society and the taxpayer , " one of the voters told news agency afp . the protests were in part meant to draw attention to the struggles of icelandic homeowners , many of whom have faced repossessions and evictions amid the country ’ s economic crisis . " we 're here to say that during the 18 months the government and the parliament have been talking about icesave , nothing has come up for the icelandic homes , " said gudrun dadda from the " defend our houses " group . doomed to fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations have already presented better repayment deals for iceland polls suggest nearly 80 percent of icelanders oppose the bill , and prime minister johanna sigurdardottir has stressed that ongoing negotiations with the uk and the netherlands were likely to produce a better deal - making the terms of the agreement being voted upon obsolete . " the referendum is meaningless , and in my opinion it will not get us much , " she told ruv television late thursday .
" i am disappointed that the first national referendum iceland has seen is under these circumstances . " sigurdardottir has vowed not to stand down after the expected rejection of the deal , adding that reaching an agreement quickly was a " matter of life or death for the icelandic economy . " icesave , an online bank that offered dutch and british investors attractive returns , collapsed with its parent bank landesbanki amid iceland 's 2008 financial crisis .
the dutch and british governments compensated account holders for their losses , and have demanded iceland pay a share as well . defunct deal the icelandic parliament passed the current compensation bill on december 31 , but president olafur ragnar grimsson refused to sign it into law and called for a referendum instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icesave collapsed amid the 2008 financial crisis in iceland the bill proposes paying about 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to britain and the netherlands , about a third of the country 's gross domestic product , according to jon danielsson , a reader in finance at the london school of economics .
" only 300,000 people live in iceland , so this is coming to about 50,000 euros per family " he told deutsche welle .
" people would like a settlement that is reasonable and recognizes that all three countries are responsible for what happened . "
the repayment amounts to far less for the uk and the netherlands than it does for iceland .
and while britain appears likely to offer a more lenient deal , danielsson said dutch media and politicians have become increasingly hostile to iceland over the issue .
" because it 's a political issue in that country , a matter of principle for them , they have taken a very hardcore position on this , " he said .
eu bid the european commission last week recommended starting european union accession talks with iceland , but britain or the netherlands are likely to block iceland 's membership until the icesave debts are repaid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir has called the referendum " meaningless " despite the government ’ s goal of eu membership , support among icelanders has dwindled amid the icesave debacle , according to eirikur bergmann , political science professor and director of the center for european studies at bifroest university .
" the eu is seen to be backing the uk and the dutch against iceland , and therefore that has created a very negative attitude in the country against eu membership , " he said .
rejection of the bill could also have negative consequences for the country 's center-left government , which has closely aligned itself with settling the icesave issue , and opposition parties have strongly opposed a repayment plan .
" if the government collapses , any settlement of icesave is even less likely than before , " said danielsson .
" the other parties that would likely enter into the government are much more adamantly opposed to icesave than the parties of the left . "

to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .
but if the sum is over a million euros , the court ruled that the sentence should not be suspended . " costly honesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inspectors can rule out a voluntary declaration if the tax payer is already under investigation faced with the real prospect of jail , it 's not surprising that people are flocking to make self-declarations .
but this is obviously also very costly .
in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .
as a taxpayer , you should really think carefully about that .

meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .
the trio in charge of the series see their program as a way to give something back after devouring so much television and film content themselves .
kurz sums it up : " it 's a problem that most people do n't get active , they just consume tv .
they do n't create anything .
it 's nice to actually make a difference . “ author : catherine bolsover editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 06.03.2010 berlin students are selling old chairs to finance projects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pick a seat of your choice !
desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 06.03.2010 germany 's first ' campus comedy ' goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cast of the new online sitcom ' 7schlaefer ' as more people watch television online , students at the ruhr university in bochum have made the first sitcom based entirely on the campus and streamed it over the internet . the 32,000 students who attend the ruhr university in bochum have unwittingly become the focus of three aspiring film-makers .
students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .
the trio in charge of the series see their program as a way to give something back after devouring so much television and film content themselves .
kurz sums it up : " it 's a problem that most people do n't get active , they just consume tv .
they do n't create anything .
it 's nice to actually make a difference . “ author : catherine bolsover editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company became mired in acrimony over rampant overspending and a 3-4 year delay in deliveries for the plane , which european powers had hoped to use in afghanistan starting from 2009 . last-ditch deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new planes were meant to be used in afghanistan this year the deal was formalized only after spain launched a last-minute bid to move jobs from airbus in the uk in a dispute over uk support , sources familiar with the matter said on thursday . britain is expected to trim its order for 25 planes to finance its share of an agreed 10-percent price hike worth a total 2 billion euros . the agreement came after a day of talks between the buyers and eads that shaped what negotiators had previously described as a deal in principle to pour in 3.5 billion euros .
after agreeing on the size of the package last week , partners continued to hold negotiations over the structure of the deal .
germany said finer points were still to be negotiated in coming weeks . german budget committee member alexander bonde from the green party criticized the agreement , saying that the reimbursable part of the deal would open up new budgetary risks . bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de future of airbus a400m is safe for now spain said the seven european nations financing the a400m turboprop transport plane have reached a compromise in the battle to finance the unexpectedly expensive military transport plane .

" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .

in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .

well over the majority of dropouts in germany are young men , and girls now earn nearly 60 percent of the high school diplomas , or abitur , conferred in the country .
the abitur is the highest degree available in german schools and allows students to begin a university education . men 's unmet needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are often reluctant to get help for their problems , says matthias franz these facts are unsurprising to teacher ingrid sumpter , who currently works in an all-boys german high school .
" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 06.03.2010 governments , eads strike deal to rescue airbus project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m was tested late last year eads , the builder of europe 's over-budget a400m military transport plane said it would report a 2009 loss as it clinched a long-awaited bailout with buyer nations costing taxpayers 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- . seven governments and the eads / airbus aerospace company have agreed to jointly pick up the tab for cost overruns that have dogged development of a new , four-engined military transport plane , the a400m .
the deal , which aims to preserve 10,000 jobs by saving the project from collapse , would force the airbus parent to make 1.8 billion euros of provisions for its share of the cost hemorrhage .
this would push it to an operating and net loss for 2009 . coupled with 2.4 billion euros the group has already written off on the project , the botched development of the new troop carrier plane will have cost europe 's largest aerospace group 4.2 billion euros , as partners wipe the slate clean of technical problems as well as management and political errors . " eads considers that this agreement provides a sound basis for a successful evolution of the a400m program , " the company said in a statement on friday , march 6 .
" eads will strive to identify opportunities to significantly reduce risks in the a400m program and to deliver a state-of-the-art product within the new frame of the contract . " ill-starred project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads has come under continual scrutiny in the last few years delays and problems in developing the west 's largest turboprop engines pushed europe 's ambitious defense project billions of euros over budget , forcing seven european nato buyer nations to step in with a mixture of direct aid and guarantees . the seven nations - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - ordered the a400m in 2003 to meet a looming shortfall in military and humanitarian airlift planes . by reducing dependence on planes from us makers , the project was conceived as a pillar of european defense ambitions . airbus committed itself in 2003 to supply 180 of the planes to the buyer nations for a final , fixed price of 20 billion euros , but later began demanding more , arguing that its factories were politically too important to fail .
germany has ordered 60 of the planes .
the company became mired in acrimony over rampant overspending and a 3-4 year delay in deliveries for the plane , which european powers had hoped to use in afghanistan starting from 2009 . last-ditch deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new planes were meant to be used in afghanistan this year the deal was formalized only after spain launched a last-minute bid to move jobs from airbus in the uk in a dispute over uk support , sources familiar with the matter said on thursday . britain is expected to trim its order for 25 planes to finance its share of an agreed 10-percent price hike worth a total 2 billion euros . the agreement came after a day of talks between the buyers and eads that shaped what negotiators had previously described as a deal in principle to pour in 3.5 billion euros .
after agreeing on the size of the package last week , partners continued to hold negotiations over the structure of the deal .
germany said finer points were still to be negotiated in coming weeks . german budget committee member alexander bonde from the green party criticized the agreement , saying that the reimbursable part of the deal would open up new budgetary risks . bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .

well over the majority of dropouts in germany are young men , and girls now earn nearly 60 percent of the high school diplomas , or abitur , conferred in the country .
the abitur is the highest degree available in german schools and allows students to begin a university education . men 's unmet needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are often reluctant to get help for their problems , says matthias franz these facts are unsurprising to teacher ingrid sumpter , who currently works in an all-boys german high school .
" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .
the trio in charge of the series see their program as a way to give something back after devouring so much television and film content themselves .
kurz sums it up : " it 's a problem that most people do n't get active , they just consume tv .
they do n't create anything .
it 's nice to actually make a difference . “ author : catherine bolsover editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

" there are cases that have not played out as they should have , " she told munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" if it were up to me , germany would n't have any statute of limitations at all , like in switzerland . "
merk said the trauma of sexual abuse is incomparable to that of other crimes , and called for a " minimum " 30-year period after the abuse is committed for prosecutors to bring charges against the abuser .
meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .
" especially for cases in which criminal prosecution is no longer possible , a round-table discussion can open a dialogue on the legitimate concerns of the victims , " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
new revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school 's current principal called the failure to report the crimes " a great mistake " amid the ongoing sex abuse scandal in german churches , allegations of past abuse also arose at an elite private school in the state of hesse .
the school , called odenwaldschule , released a statement through its web site friday saying two students had come forward claiming they were abused by the former school principal between 1975 and 1980 .
the school has since admitted there are reports of more than 20 victims , and that at least three teachers were involved in the abuse .
ex-pupils at the school have told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau the number of victims lies between 50 and 100 .
" it was a failure and a great mistake that the school did n't look into these allegations , " current principal margarita kaufmann told frankfurter rundschau. acb / epd / apn / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well over the majority of dropouts in germany are young men , and girls now earn nearly 60 percent of the high school diplomas , or abitur , conferred in the country .
the abitur is the highest degree available in german schools and allows students to begin a university education . men 's unmet needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are often reluctant to get help for their problems , says matthias franz these facts are unsurprising to teacher ingrid sumpter , who currently works in an all-boys german high school .
" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are cases that have not played out as they should have , " she told munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" if it were up to me , germany would n't have any statute of limitations at all , like in switzerland . "
merk said the trauma of sexual abuse is incomparable to that of other crimes , and called for a " minimum " 30-year period after the abuse is committed for prosecutors to bring charges against the abuser .
meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .

the school , called odenwaldschule , released a statement through its web site friday saying two students had come forward claiming they were abused by the former school principal between 1975 and 1980 .
the school has since admitted there are reports of more than 20 victims , and that at least three teachers were involved in the abuse .

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 06.03.2010 german tax dodgers rush forward after swiss cd affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of rich people are worried they could be on the cd thousands of wealthy germans have come forward after authorities said they would buy a stolen cd with the names of up to 1500 german citizens hiding cash away in switzerland . according to a report from the world tax service , the number of voluntary declarations in germany doubled in the last week of february alone - from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 .
to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .
but if the sum is over a million euros , the court ruled that the sentence should not be suspended . " costly honesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inspectors can rule out a voluntary declaration if the tax payer is already under investigation faced with the real prospect of jail , it 's not surprising that people are flocking to make self-declarations .
but this is obviously also very costly .
in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .
as a taxpayer , you should really think carefully about that . " and there is another factor that may weigh heavily on those with hidden swiss fortunes : the political pressure is already growing to get rid of the voluntary amnesty option altogether . author : ben knight editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.03.2010 icelanders protest icesave repayment plan as bill heads for rejection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most icelanders are expected to reject the referendum deal iceland polling stations opened saturday for a referendum on a hugely unpopular bank collapse repayment deal for britain and the netherlands , with surveys and even the government saying a ' no ' vote was inevitable . hundreds of demonstrators protested outside the icelandic parliament on saturday calling for a " no " vote in the country ’ s first referendum since independence from denmark in 1944 . the protests were a public manifestation of the anger many icelanders feel toward the bill .
while polls show a majority feel the country is ethically bound to pay back some of the money lost through icesave ’ s collapse , the current bill is widely seen as unreasonable . " the people who own the banks win when they make money , but when they lose the debt is -lrb- pushed off -rrb- on society and the taxpayer , " one of the voters told news agency afp . the protests were in part meant to draw attention to the struggles of icelandic homeowners , many of whom have faced repossessions and evictions amid the country ’ s economic crisis . " we 're here to say that during the 18 months the government and the parliament have been talking about icesave , nothing has come up for the icelandic homes , " said gudrun dadda from the " defend our houses " group . doomed to fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations have already presented better repayment deals for iceland polls suggest nearly 80 percent of icelanders oppose the bill , and prime minister johanna sigurdardottir has stressed that ongoing negotiations with the uk and the netherlands were likely to produce a better deal - making the terms of the agreement being voted upon obsolete . " the referendum is meaningless , and in my opinion it will not get us much , " she told ruv television late thursday .
" i am disappointed that the first national referendum iceland has seen is under these circumstances . " sigurdardottir has vowed not to stand down after the expected rejection of the deal , adding that reaching an agreement quickly was a " matter of life or death for the icelandic economy . " icesave , an online bank that offered dutch and british investors attractive returns , collapsed with its parent bank landesbanki amid iceland 's 2008 financial crisis .
the dutch and british governments compensated account holders for their losses , and have demanded iceland pay a share as well . defunct deal the icelandic parliament passed the current compensation bill on december 31 , but president olafur ragnar grimsson refused to sign it into law and called for a referendum instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icesave collapsed amid the 2008 financial crisis in iceland the bill proposes paying about 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to britain and the netherlands , about a third of the country 's gross domestic product , according to jon danielsson , a reader in finance at the london school of economics .
" only 300,000 people live in iceland , so this is coming to about 50,000 euros per family " he told deutsche welle .
" people would like a settlement that is reasonable and recognizes that all three countries are responsible for what happened . "
the repayment amounts to far less for the uk and the netherlands than it does for iceland .
and while britain appears likely to offer a more lenient deal , danielsson said dutch media and politicians have become increasingly hostile to iceland over the issue .
" because it 's a political issue in that country , a matter of principle for them , they have taken a very hardcore position on this , " he said .
eu bid the european commission last week recommended starting european union accession talks with iceland , but britain or the netherlands are likely to block iceland 's membership until the icesave debts are repaid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir has called the referendum " meaningless " despite the government ’ s goal of eu membership , support among icelanders has dwindled amid the icesave debacle , according to eirikur bergmann , political science professor and director of the center for european studies at bifroest university .
" the eu is seen to be backing the uk and the dutch against iceland , and therefore that has created a very negative attitude in the country against eu membership , " he said .
rejection of the bill could also have negative consequences for the country 's center-left government , which has closely aligned itself with settling the icesave issue , and opposition parties have strongly opposed a repayment plan .
" if the government collapses , any settlement of icesave is even less likely than before , " said danielsson .
" the other parties that would likely enter into the government are much more adamantly opposed to icesave than the parties of the left . "

" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

the deal , which aims to preserve 10,000 jobs by saving the project from collapse , would force the airbus parent to make 1.8 billion euros of provisions for its share of the cost hemorrhage .
this would push it to an operating and net loss for 2009 . coupled with 2.4 billion euros the group has already written off on the project , the botched development of the new troop carrier plane will have cost europe 's largest aerospace group 4.2 billion euros , as partners wipe the slate clean of technical problems as well as management and political errors . " eads considers that this agreement provides a sound basis for a successful evolution of the a400m program , " the company said in a statement on friday , march 6 .
" eads will strive to identify opportunities to significantly reduce risks in the a400m program and to deliver a state-of-the-art product within the new frame of the contract . " ill-starred project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads has come under continual scrutiny in the last few years delays and problems in developing the west 's largest turboprop engines pushed europe 's ambitious defense project billions of euros over budget , forcing seven european nato buyer nations to step in with a mixture of direct aid and guarantees . the seven nations - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - ordered the a400m in 2003 to meet a looming shortfall in military and humanitarian airlift planes . by reducing dependence on planes from us makers , the project was conceived as a pillar of european defense ambitions . airbus committed itself in 2003 to supply 180 of the planes to the buyer nations for a final , fixed price of 20 billion euros , but later began demanding more , arguing that its factories were politically too important to fail .
germany has ordered 60 of the planes .
the company became mired in acrimony over rampant overspending and a 3-4 year delay in deliveries for the plane , which european powers had hoped to use in afghanistan starting from 2009 . last-ditch deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new planes were meant to be used in afghanistan this year the deal was formalized only after spain launched a last-minute bid to move jobs from airbus in the uk in a dispute over uk support , sources familiar with the matter said on thursday . britain is expected to trim its order for 25 planes to finance its share of an agreed 10-percent price hike worth a total 2 billion euros . the agreement came after a day of talks between the buyers and eads that shaped what negotiators had previously described as a deal in principle to pour in 3.5 billion euros .
after agreeing on the size of the package last week , partners continued to hold negotiations over the structure of the deal .
germany said finer points were still to be negotiated in coming weeks . german budget committee member alexander bonde from the green party criticized the agreement , saying that the reimbursable part of the deal would open up new budgetary risks . bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well over the majority of dropouts in germany are young men , and girls now earn nearly 60 percent of the high school diplomas , or abitur , conferred in the country .
the abitur is the highest degree available in german schools and allows students to begin a university education . men 's unmet needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are often reluctant to get help for their problems , says matthias franz these facts are unsurprising to teacher ingrid sumpter , who currently works in an all-boys german high school .
" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are cases that have not played out as they should have , " she told munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" if it were up to me , germany would n't have any statute of limitations at all , like in switzerland . "
merk said the trauma of sexual abuse is incomparable to that of other crimes , and called for a " minimum " 30-year period after the abuse is committed for prosecutors to bring charges against the abuser .
meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .
" especially for cases in which criminal prosecution is no longer possible , a round-table discussion can open a dialogue on the legitimate concerns of the victims , " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
new revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school 's current principal called the failure to report the crimes " a great mistake " amid the ongoing sex abuse scandal in german churches , allegations of past abuse also arose at an elite private school in the state of hesse .
the school , called odenwaldschule , released a statement through its web site friday saying two students had come forward claiming they were abused by the former school principal between 1975 and 1980 .
the school has since admitted there are reports of more than 20 victims , and that at least three teachers were involved in the abuse .
ex-pupils at the school have told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau the number of victims lies between 50 and 100 .
" it was a failure and a great mistake that the school did n't look into these allegations , " current principal margarita kaufmann told frankfurter rundschau. acb / epd / apn / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 06.03.2010 berlin students are selling old chairs to finance projects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pick a seat of your choice !
desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .
but if the sum is over a million euros , the court ruled that the sentence should not be suspended . " costly honesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inspectors can rule out a voluntary declaration if the tax payer is already under investigation faced with the real prospect of jail , it 's not surprising that people are flocking to make self-declarations .
but this is obviously also very costly .
in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .
as a taxpayer , you should really think carefully about that . " and there is another factor that may weigh heavily on those with hidden swiss fortunes : the political pressure is already growing to get rid of the voluntary amnesty option altogether . author : ben knight editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are cases that have not played out as they should have , " she told munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" if it were up to me , germany would n't have any statute of limitations at all , like in switzerland . "
merk said the trauma of sexual abuse is incomparable to that of other crimes , and called for a " minimum " 30-year period after the abuse is committed for prosecutors to bring charges against the abuser .
meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .
" especially for cases in which criminal prosecution is no longer possible , a round-table discussion can open a dialogue on the legitimate concerns of the victims , " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .

the school , called odenwaldschule , released a statement through its web site friday saying two students had come forward claiming they were abused by the former school principal between 1975 and 1980 .
the school has since admitted there are reports of more than 20 victims , and that at least three teachers were involved in the abuse .

well over the majority of dropouts in germany are young men , and girls now earn nearly 60 percent of the high school diplomas , or abitur , conferred in the country .
the abitur is the highest degree available in german schools and allows students to begin a university education . men 's unmet needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are often reluctant to get help for their problems , says matthias franz these facts are unsurprising to teacher ingrid sumpter , who currently works in an all-boys german high school .
" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

well over the majority of dropouts in germany are young men , and girls now earn nearly 60 percent of the high school diplomas , or abitur , conferred in the country .
the abitur is the highest degree available in german schools and allows students to begin a university education . men 's unmet needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are often reluctant to get help for their problems , says matthias franz these facts are unsurprising to teacher ingrid sumpter , who currently works in an all-boys german high school .
" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

challenge to federation the case is the latest to be brought by amerall , a former refereeing advisor , who had intended to challenge the german football federation in connection with the accusations .
63-year-old amerell , who resigned in february , had been taking the federation to court for releasing details of allegations made against him .

while polls show a majority feel the country is ethically bound to pay back some of the money lost through icesave ’ s collapse , the current bill is widely seen as unreasonable . " the people who own the banks win when they make money , but when they lose the debt is -lrb- pushed off -rrb- on society and the taxpayer , " one of the voters told news agency afp . the protests were in part meant to draw attention to the struggles of icelandic homeowners , many of whom have faced repossessions and evictions amid the country ’ s economic crisis . " we 're here to say that during the 18 months the government and the parliament have been talking about icesave , nothing has come up for the icelandic homes , " said gudrun dadda from the " defend our houses " group . doomed to fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations have already presented better repayment deals for iceland polls suggest nearly 80 percent of icelanders oppose the bill , and prime minister johanna sigurdardottir has stressed that ongoing negotiations with the uk and the netherlands were likely to produce a better deal - making the terms of the agreement being voted upon obsolete . " the referendum is meaningless , and in my opinion it will not get us much , " she told ruv television late thursday .
" i am disappointed that the first national referendum iceland has seen is under these circumstances . " sigurdardottir has vowed not to stand down after the expected rejection of the deal , adding that reaching an agreement quickly was a " matter of life or death for the icelandic economy . " icesave , an online bank that offered dutch and british investors attractive returns , collapsed with its parent bank landesbanki amid iceland 's 2008 financial crisis .
the dutch and british governments compensated account holders for their losses , and have demanded iceland pay a share as well . defunct deal the icelandic parliament passed the current compensation bill on december 31 , but president olafur ragnar grimsson refused to sign it into law and called for a referendum instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icesave collapsed amid the 2008 financial crisis in iceland the bill proposes paying about 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to britain and the netherlands , about a third of the country 's gross domestic product , according to jon danielsson , a reader in finance at the london school of economics .
" only 300,000 people live in iceland , so this is coming to about 50,000 euros per family " he told deutsche welle .
" people would like a settlement that is reasonable and recognizes that all three countries are responsible for what happened . "
the repayment amounts to far less for the uk and the netherlands than it does for iceland .
and while britain appears likely to offer a more lenient deal , danielsson said dutch media and politicians have become increasingly hostile to iceland over the issue .
" because it 's a political issue in that country , a matter of principle for them , they have taken a very hardcore position on this , " he said .
eu bid the european commission last week recommended starting european union accession talks with iceland , but britain or the netherlands are likely to block iceland 's membership until the icesave debts are repaid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir has called the referendum " meaningless " despite the government ’ s goal of eu membership , support among icelanders has dwindled amid the icesave debacle , according to eirikur bergmann , political science professor and director of the center for european studies at bifroest university .
" the eu is seen to be backing the uk and the dutch against iceland , and therefore that has created a very negative attitude in the country against eu membership , " he said .
rejection of the bill could also have negative consequences for the country 's center-left government , which has closely aligned itself with settling the icesave issue , and opposition parties have strongly opposed a repayment plan .
" if the government collapses , any settlement of icesave is even less likely than before , " said danielsson .
" the other parties that would likely enter into the government are much more adamantly opposed to icesave than the parties of the left . "

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .
the trio in charge of the series see their program as a way to give something back after devouring so much television and film content themselves .
kurz sums it up : " it 's a problem that most people do n't get active , they just consume tv .
they do n't create anything .
it 's nice to actually make a difference . “ author : catherine bolsover editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is the latest in a saga that even threatened german football federation president theo zwanziger . the former refereeing official manfred amerell intends to sue bundesliga referee michael kempter for damages .
amerell 's munich-based lawyer juergen langer said that his client intended to take action after kempter accused him of sexual harassment .
langer said his client would sue for defamation and slander for damages for an unspecified amount .
" it is about damage to personal rights , " said langer adding that his client had suffered greatly as a result of claims from kempter .
" he -lrb- kempter -rrb- has started an avalanche as a result of which mr amerell was greatly damaged , " said langer .
challenge to federation the case is the latest to be brought by amerall , a former refereeing advisor , who had intended to challenge the german football federation in connection with the accusations .
63-year-old amerell , who resigned in february , had been taking the federation to court for releasing details of allegations made against him .
he withdrew an application for an injunction against further publication of details on thursday when the federation agreed to hand over affidavits in which four referees accused him of harassment .

in it , kempter allegedly appears to say that he hoped that bayern munich would lose a match against their european champions league rivals ac milan in april , 2007 .
amerell claims that affectionate terms used in emails sent to him indicate that the relationship was not one-sided .
kempter says that any terms of endearment were only used because he was under pressure to do so from amerell. rc / sid / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

" there are cases that have not played out as they should have , " she told munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" if it were up to me , germany would n't have any statute of limitations at all , like in switzerland . "
merk said the trauma of sexual abuse is incomparable to that of other crimes , and called for a " minimum " 30-year period after the abuse is committed for prosecutors to bring charges against the abuser .
meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .

the school , called odenwaldschule , released a statement through its web site friday saying two students had come forward claiming they were abused by the former school principal between 1975 and 1980 .
the school has since admitted there are reports of more than 20 victims , and that at least three teachers were involved in the abuse .

" if it were up to me , germany would n't have any statute of limitations at all , like in switzerland . "
merk said the trauma of sexual abuse is incomparable to that of other crimes , and called for a " minimum " 30-year period after the abuse is committed for prosecutors to bring charges against the abuser .
meanwhile the federal german justice minister repeated calls for a round-table discussion with catholic church officials on the issue of sex abuse .

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

" hundreds of pupils were beaten , " thomas pfister told a news conference on friday , march 5 .
" there were very extreme cases of mistreatment which normally would have been punished with long prison sentences . " instead , pfister said , " a cloak of silence was thrown over the charges . " the statute of limitations has lapsed on most of the cases , meaning individuals can no longer be prosecuted , but the catholic church appointed pfister to investigate what happened at the benedictine school in ettal in response to an ever-widening abuse scandal involving several catholic schools across germany . pfister said 100 boys may have been victims in ettal alone . one priest 's admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer asked for forgiveness ettal monastery treasurer johannes bauer also admitted to brutally beating pupils while he was a teacher there between 1985 and 1987 . " to my shame , i have to say openly that i also brutally abused children physically and humiliated them , " he said .
" i am very sorry and ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart . " the vatican has been consulted by the monastery about how best it can take a " new spiritual direction . " four priests are suspected to have been involved in the abuse , one of whom is dead .
in connection with the accusations , three monks at the wechselburg monastery in saxony have now been suspended . the investigator added , however , that the offences were relatively limited , with 10 priests accused in total . " to imagine the abbey as a community of sadistic raping monks would not be accurate , " said pfister . police in munich are also investigating one teacher who is a currently a priest at the school .
he allegedly posted pictures on websites showing his bare-chested pupils during hikes in the alps . more allegations across germany ettal is one of three church schools in bavaria which have been rocked by allegations of clerical abuse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations were made about past abuses at a choir school in ravensburg the regensburger domspatzen choir school , which was once headed by georg ratzinger , the brother of pope benedict xvi , is at the centre of allegations from three former pupils that sexual abuse took place there in the early 1960s .
two former senior teachers at the school were jailed , in 1958 and 1971 , for pedophile sex , according to the regensburg diocese . meanwhile , the capuchin order said that a former director of its burghausen school sexually molested pupils between 1984 and 1985 . nationwide , more than 150 other people have contacted church-appointed lawyers , describing incidents of abuse at various church schools . the catholic church has come under heavy attack in germany after details of abuse at the elite jesuit canisius college in berlin were made public earlier this year . a spokesman for the vatican on friday said it was " taking very seriously all aspects of the pedophile scandal in germany .

students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .
the trio in charge of the series see their program as a way to give something back after devouring so much television and film content themselves .
kurz sums it up : " it 's a problem that most people do n't get active , they just consume tv .
they do n't create anything .
it 's nice to actually make a difference . “ author : catherine bolsover editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .
the trio in charge of the series see their program as a way to give something back after devouring so much television and film content themselves .
kurz sums it up : " it 's a problem that most people do n't get active , they just consume tv .
they do n't create anything .
it 's nice to actually make a difference . “ author : catherine bolsover editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal , which aims to preserve 10,000 jobs by saving the project from collapse , would force the airbus parent to make 1.8 billion euros of provisions for its share of the cost hemorrhage .
this would push it to an operating and net loss for 2009 . coupled with 2.4 billion euros the group has already written off on the project , the botched development of the new troop carrier plane will have cost europe 's largest aerospace group 4.2 billion euros , as partners wipe the slate clean of technical problems as well as management and political errors . " eads considers that this agreement provides a sound basis for a successful evolution of the a400m program , " the company said in a statement on friday , march 6 .
" eads will strive to identify opportunities to significantly reduce risks in the a400m program and to deliver a state-of-the-art product within the new frame of the contract . " ill-starred project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads has come under continual scrutiny in the last few years delays and problems in developing the west 's largest turboprop engines pushed europe 's ambitious defense project billions of euros over budget , forcing seven european nato buyer nations to step in with a mixture of direct aid and guarantees . the seven nations - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - ordered the a400m in 2003 to meet a looming shortfall in military and humanitarian airlift planes . by reducing dependence on planes from us makers , the project was conceived as a pillar of european defense ambitions . airbus committed itself in 2003 to supply 180 of the planes to the buyer nations for a final , fixed price of 20 billion euros , but later began demanding more , arguing that its factories were politically too important to fail .
germany has ordered 60 of the planes .
the company became mired in acrimony over rampant overspending and a 3-4 year delay in deliveries for the plane , which european powers had hoped to use in afghanistan starting from 2009 . last-ditch deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new planes were meant to be used in afghanistan this year the deal was formalized only after spain launched a last-minute bid to move jobs from airbus in the uk in a dispute over uk support , sources familiar with the matter said on thursday . britain is expected to trim its order for 25 planes to finance its share of an agreed 10-percent price hike worth a total 2 billion euros . the agreement came after a day of talks between the buyers and eads that shaped what negotiators had previously described as a deal in principle to pour in 3.5 billion euros .
after agreeing on the size of the package last week , partners continued to hold negotiations over the structure of the deal .
germany said finer points were still to be negotiated in coming weeks . german budget committee member alexander bonde from the green party criticized the agreement , saying that the reimbursable part of the deal would open up new budgetary risks . bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .
kurz explained why he was interested in playing the role .
" i watch a lot of tv shows and my favorite characters are normally the petty criminals because they are a bit stupid , but the funniest , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university may provide funding for subsequent episodes filming the pilot it took weeks of writing , planning and casting as well as two days of filming in the campus cafe to make the 14-minute pilot episode .
skrzypowski explained it was a long process because they wanted it to look different from other student films on youtube .
" you look at them and see they are not professional , “ he said .
" we are not professionals but we are passionate and surround ourselves with people who know what they 're doing , “ he added .
the ruhr university provided some funding for the first episode , which helped the team pay for a professional cameraman to film the episode in high definition .
everyone else involved in the project gave up their time for free .
as the team deal with the feedback and media interest in the first episode , they are continuing to plan the rest of the ' 7schlaefer ' series .
the university has intimated it may be able to fund more episodes , and the team have five more episodes written and ready to go .
the trio in charge of the series see their program as a way to give something back after devouring so much television and film content themselves .
kurz sums it up : " it 's a problem that most people do n't get active , they just consume tv .
they do n't create anything .
it 's nice to actually make a difference . “ author : catherine bolsover editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal , which aims to preserve 10,000 jobs by saving the project from collapse , would force the airbus parent to make 1.8 billion euros of provisions for its share of the cost hemorrhage .
this would push it to an operating and net loss for 2009 . coupled with 2.4 billion euros the group has already written off on the project , the botched development of the new troop carrier plane will have cost europe 's largest aerospace group 4.2 billion euros , as partners wipe the slate clean of technical problems as well as management and political errors . " eads considers that this agreement provides a sound basis for a successful evolution of the a400m program , " the company said in a statement on friday , march 6 .
" eads will strive to identify opportunities to significantly reduce risks in the a400m program and to deliver a state-of-the-art product within the new frame of the contract . " ill-starred project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads has come under continual scrutiny in the last few years delays and problems in developing the west 's largest turboprop engines pushed europe 's ambitious defense project billions of euros over budget , forcing seven european nato buyer nations to step in with a mixture of direct aid and guarantees . the seven nations - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - ordered the a400m in 2003 to meet a looming shortfall in military and humanitarian airlift planes . by reducing dependence on planes from us makers , the project was conceived as a pillar of european defense ambitions . airbus committed itself in 2003 to supply 180 of the planes to the buyer nations for a final , fixed price of 20 billion euros , but later began demanding more , arguing that its factories were politically too important to fail .
germany has ordered 60 of the planes .
the company became mired in acrimony over rampant overspending and a 3-4 year delay in deliveries for the plane , which european powers had hoped to use in afghanistan starting from 2009 . last-ditch deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new planes were meant to be used in afghanistan this year the deal was formalized only after spain launched a last-minute bid to move jobs from airbus in the uk in a dispute over uk support , sources familiar with the matter said on thursday . britain is expected to trim its order for 25 planes to finance its share of an agreed 10-percent price hike worth a total 2 billion euros . the agreement came after a day of talks between the buyers and eads that shaped what negotiators had previously described as a deal in principle to pour in 3.5 billion euros .
after agreeing on the size of the package last week , partners continued to hold negotiations over the structure of the deal .
germany said finer points were still to be negotiated in coming weeks . german budget committee member alexander bonde from the green party criticized the agreement , saying that the reimbursable part of the deal would open up new budgetary risks . bk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni . the vociferous protests of tens of thousands of students held last year still ring in many berliners ' ears .
they took to the streets and staged university sit-ins to campaign for better degree courses , the abolition of tuition fees and improved student-teacher ratios .
they also called for more money to create a more efficient education system .
the protests involved students from berlin 's many educational institutions , including the renowned humboldt university .
but the german capital belongs to the poorest of germany 's 16 states , and with the economic crisis still making itself felt , the kind of additional resources for education called for by the students is unlikely to be granted by berlin 's senate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive student protests rocked over 70 german towns in 2009 but a group of resourceful students from the humboldt university 's faculty for economic sciences have developed an initiative to raise badly needed funds for various study projects .
as the faculty 's interior is currently being replaced by new rows of chairs , lamps and other features , some enterprising students had the idea of selling the old seats to alumni and other friends of the faculty .
action yes , destruction no !
eva heberer is among the students who have thrown their weight behind the so-called platzstiften , or ' buy-a-seat ' campaign .
" during the student protests i saw that people destroyed stuff in the university , " heberer said .
" it always costs money to repair the damage , and i thought that platzstiften would be a much better idea than occupying a lecture room and screaming . "
the campaign has already delivered well over 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- into university coffers , money that will come in handy for a number of projects .
heberer said the faculty 's masters and senior bachelors students give lectures to fellow students for free to get teaching experience .
now the faculty hopes to channel some of the funds from the " buy-a-seat " campaign to these lecturers .
christian bergner , student and co-organizer of the scheme , is extremely pleased with its success .
" we earn some money with it , and the money goes back to the students , " christian says .
" and with the money , more power goes to us students .
we can suddenly change things for the better on our own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian berger and eva heberer spearhead the campaign good deal for buyers ?
so why would anyone want to buy an old chair from the faculty 's main auditorium ?
the gratitude of current students is probably not enough to induce alumni to open their wallets .
heberer and berger say there is more in it for the donors .
buyers get invited to special events or dinners with faculty professors .
in addition , signs with the buyers ' names and enrolment dates will be fixed to the new chairs installed in the space once occupied by the chair they bought .
but the potential buyer 's fame will not be eternal .
in ten years , the scheme is expected to be revived , and the chairs will be re-sold to fresh alumni .
the students ' fund-raising project has the backing of the faculty management .
professors and students believe that it wo n't be long before the concept is adopted by student groups at other universities across the country .

" the people who own the banks win when they make money , but when they lose the debt is -lrb- pushed off -rrb- on society and the taxpayer , " one of the voters told news agency afp . the protests were in part meant to draw attention to the struggles of icelandic homeowners , many of whom have faced repossessions and evictions amid the country ’ s economic crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 06.03.2010 germany 's first ' campus comedy ' goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cast of the new online sitcom ' 7schlaefer ' as more people watch television online , students at the ruhr university in bochum have made the first sitcom based entirely on the campus and streamed it over the internet . the 32,000 students who attend the ruhr university in bochum have unwittingly become the focus of three aspiring film-makers .
students yannick sievers , alexander skrzypowski and peter kurz have made germany 's first so-called ' campus sitcom ' based on the lives and relationships of their fellow students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the programme 's creators : peter kurz und alexander skrzpkowski called ' 7schlaefer ' -lrb- or ' seven sleepers ' -rrb- , the show broadcast its pilot episode to an online audience of thousands – with over a thousand hits on the video site youtube alone .
none of the three creators have any background in film-making , and the first episode was made purely as a hobby .
" it started out as a way to have fun , “ co-creator alex skrzypowski told deutsche welle .
" we are all very interested in sitcoms from america , england and all over the world and we thought it could inspire us to do something of our own . “ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series is filmed entirely on the ruhr university campus a new genre frustrated with the lack of new ideas coming through on normal television , the three creators decided to turn to the internet .
" the main tv channels are getting worse , and more people are using the internet , “ said peter kurz .
" you can see it particularly with music videos , more people are going online – and other fields can profit from this too . “ " it 's also free , “ skrzypowski added .
" we are not bound by anything or anybody , we can develop the script how we want and it 's cool to have that freedom . “ the producers claim to have made an entirely new genre – the campus-sitcom .
based on their observations of their fellow students at the ruhr university , the show is based on the lives of normal students in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seven main characters all meet at a party in the pilot episode stereotypical students the pilot episode centers around a student party , which is where the characters all meet for the first time .
anyone who 's ever been to college will instantly recognize the characters , as each fits a particular stereotype - there 's michael the jock , astrid the feminist , cindy the bimbo and johann the nerd .
" you 're confronted with these sterotypes every day , " said skrzypowski .
" you 're walking around campus and you see the snobs , the emos , the chicks – and we have all that in the show .
we thought it would be funny to smash them all together and see what happens . "
seventy students auditioned for the main roles , which shows how much enthusiasm there was for the project on campus .
one of the creators , peter kurz , plays one of the leads himself , as pete the drug dealer .

while polls show a majority feel the country is ethically bound to pay back some of the money lost through icesave ’ s collapse , the current bill is widely seen as unreasonable . " the people who own the banks win when they make money , but when they lose the debt is -lrb- pushed off -rrb- on society and the taxpayer , " one of the voters told news agency afp . the protests were in part meant to draw attention to the struggles of icelandic homeowners , many of whom have faced repossessions and evictions amid the country ’ s economic crisis . " we 're here to say that during the 18 months the government and the parliament have been talking about icesave , nothing has come up for the icelandic homes , " said gudrun dadda from the " defend our houses " group . doomed to fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations have already presented better repayment deals for iceland polls suggest nearly 80 percent of icelanders oppose the bill , and prime minister johanna sigurdardottir has stressed that ongoing negotiations with the uk and the netherlands were likely to produce a better deal - making the terms of the agreement being voted upon obsolete . " the referendum is meaningless , and in my opinion it will not get us much , " she told ruv television late thursday .
" i am disappointed that the first national referendum iceland has seen is under these circumstances . " sigurdardottir has vowed not to stand down after the expected rejection of the deal , adding that reaching an agreement quickly was a " matter of life or death for the icelandic economy . " icesave , an online bank that offered dutch and british investors attractive returns , collapsed with its parent bank landesbanki amid iceland 's 2008 financial crisis .
the dutch and british governments compensated account holders for their losses , and have demanded iceland pay a share as well . defunct deal the icelandic parliament passed the current compensation bill on december 31 , but president olafur ragnar grimsson refused to sign it into law and called for a referendum instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icesave collapsed amid the 2008 financial crisis in iceland the bill proposes paying about 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to britain and the netherlands , about a third of the country 's gross domestic product , according to jon danielsson , a reader in finance at the london school of economics .
" only 300,000 people live in iceland , so this is coming to about 50,000 euros per family " he told deutsche welle .
" people would like a settlement that is reasonable and recognizes that all three countries are responsible for what happened . "
the repayment amounts to far less for the uk and the netherlands than it does for iceland .
and while britain appears likely to offer a more lenient deal , danielsson said dutch media and politicians have become increasingly hostile to iceland over the issue .
" because it 's a political issue in that country , a matter of principle for them , they have taken a very hardcore position on this , " he said .
eu bid the european commission last week recommended starting european union accession talks with iceland , but britain or the netherlands are likely to block iceland 's membership until the icesave debts are repaid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir has called the referendum " meaningless " despite the government ’ s goal of eu membership , support among icelanders has dwindled amid the icesave debacle , according to eirikur bergmann , political science professor and director of the center for european studies at bifroest university .
" the eu is seen to be backing the uk and the dutch against iceland , and therefore that has created a very negative attitude in the country against eu membership , " he said .
rejection of the bill could also have negative consequences for the country 's center-left government , which has closely aligned itself with settling the icesave issue , and opposition parties have strongly opposed a repayment plan .
" if the government collapses , any settlement of icesave is even less likely than before , " said danielsson .
" the other parties that would likely enter into the government are much more adamantly opposed to icesave than the parties of the left . "

well over the majority of dropouts in germany are young men , and girls now earn nearly 60 percent of the high school diplomas , or abitur , conferred in the country .
the abitur is the highest degree available in german schools and allows students to begin a university education . men 's unmet needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are often reluctant to get help for their problems , says matthias franz these facts are unsurprising to teacher ingrid sumpter , who currently works in an all-boys german high school .
" i think that lesson plans elsewhere and even at our school are often geared more toward girls than boys - both in terms of their content and how they 're presented , " sumpter told deutsche welle . sumpter believes that boys need more variety , particularly more exercise and movement , during their time in class in order to remain focused .
" unfortunately , " she said , " the structure of the school day often does n't accommodate their needs well enough . " psychotherapist and professor matthias franz echoed sumpter 's concerns at a major conference last week in dusseldorf which he helped organize to address the challenges facing men in germany today . part of the problem is that men are less willing to seek the help of doctors or psychologists , according to franz .
" we also lack political initiatives that support boys and men while taking into account and accepting their masculinity , " he added . changing the rules in school the lack of support for the problems boys face in german schools is also an issue highlighted by klaus hurrelmann , a leading german sociologist . " we have clearly been successful in encouraging young women in school - who were systematically disadvantaged for a long time - but we now need to make similar efforts on behalf of boys , " said hurrelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in germany are a central point of hurrelmann 's research the sociologist suggested several reforms for german school systems to address the difference in male and female achievement , including a move to make the classroom 's social rules and expectations more transparent .
in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .
this picture of men passed into the popular media and finally into the population 's attitudes at large - including among men , " claimed hollstein . both hollstein and hurrelmann agree that an important step in addressing the problems men face today lies in changing the face of early education .
he believes men should assume more responsibility for children as they begin school in order to serve as role models for boys at that critical stage of development . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .

in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .

in a system where the vast majority of caregivers and teachers for young people are women , hurrelmann stressed that boys struggle more than girls to understand and play by the rules . the ability of boys and girls respectively to internalize the rules of the educational system may help explain the difference in dropout and abitur completion rates between the two sexes . the impact of feminism the negative trends in education and health for men accompany broader developments in society 's attitude toward gender , according to swiss sociologist walter hollstein .
part of his research traces the image of men presented by prominent feminist authors . " many feminist intellectuals characterized men in deeply negative ways .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 06.03.2010 german tax dodgers rush forward after swiss cd affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of rich people are worried they could be on the cd thousands of wealthy germans have come forward after authorities said they would buy a stolen cd with the names of up to 1500 german citizens hiding cash away in switzerland . according to a report from the world tax service , the number of voluntary declarations in germany doubled in the last week of february alone - from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 .
to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .
but if the sum is over a million euros , the court ruled that the sentence should not be suspended . " costly honesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inspectors can rule out a voluntary declaration if the tax payer is already under investigation faced with the real prospect of jail , it 's not surprising that people are flocking to make self-declarations .
but this is obviously also very costly .
in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .
as a taxpayer , you should really think carefully about that . " and there is another factor that may weigh heavily on those with hidden swiss fortunes : the political pressure is already growing to get rid of the voluntary amnesty option altogether . author : ben knight editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to date , the total number in 2010 includes 1,300 in baden-wuerttemberg , 1,200 in bavaria , 500 in hesse , 430 in lower saxony , 200 in hamburg and 175 in schleswig-holstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister schäuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in " it is a hell of a lot more than in previous years , " spokesman for the finance department of the state of berlin , daniel abbou , told deutsche welle .
" we 're surprised about the sudden honesty in the taxpayer . "
it seems that quite a few germans have been shaken by the news that the government has every intention of buying the tax data , even if it has been illegally copied .
at a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- , the disc containing data on german tax cheats could well be the most expensive cd in the world .
unsurprisingly it 's spawned many follow-ups , with state financial authorities seemingly being offered new cds every week . exactly how much the state stands to gain from the flood of voluntary declarations is far from clear - there are thousands of details to assess and collate .
but with millions in capital gains , interest and fortunes suddenly being declared , the taxman 's windfall is likely to be in the tens of millions . edgy millionaires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cds give tax inspectors a list of potential suspects tax adviser lenhard jesse has been doing good business in the past few weeks .
sitting in his spotless and well-appointed office on berlin 's prestigious friedrichstrasse , jesse tells of panicky millionaires coming in with a guilty look on their faces . " the people who want advice are very nervous , and are under a lot of pressure because they 're unsure whether they are on this cd and what happens if they are on it , " jesse says . once he has soothed these fretful millionaires , jesse assesses their options and begins the arduous task of piecing together their financial history . " first , you have to go ten years back , and determine their income - usually we 're talking about capital gains , interest , dividends - whatever , " jesse says .
" when you 've ascertained everything , you go to the authority and declare the income .
then our client has the advantage , if you see it that way , that they ca n't be prosecuted . " unknown deadlines people who retroactively declare their income voluntarily can expect to avoid prosecution , but only if the authorities have not already opened an investigation .
if the tax authorities have formed a suspicion that an individual is hiding money , and have begun to investigate , a voluntary declaration is no longer accepted . as tax lawyer jens schmidt of the firm white & case points out , this means that the cds currently being put in circulation have put extra time pressure on people who have ' accidentally forgotten ' to pay their taxes .
on top of this , a recent constitutional court ruling has made sure that serious tax offenses will receive heavy punishments . " if the sum of unpaid tax is in the six-figure area , a fine is less likely - you are more likely to get a custodial sentence , " says schmidt .
" that does n't necessarily mean you end up in jail .
you might get a suspended sentence .
but if the sum is over a million euros , the court ruled that the sentence should not be suspended . " costly honesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inspectors can rule out a voluntary declaration if the tax payer is already under investigation faced with the real prospect of jail , it 's not surprising that people are flocking to make self-declarations .
but this is obviously also very costly .
in addition to paying the years of back-taxes , the tax offenders also have to pay interest of six percent per year on what was unpaid . " independent of the current situation , i would always advise people to voluntarily declare , " schmidt says .
" the chances of keeping money hidden from the financial authorities are getting slimmer .
as a taxpayer , you should really think carefully about that . " and there is another factor that may weigh heavily on those with hidden swiss fortunes : the political pressure is already growing to get rid of the voluntary amnesty option altogether . author : ben knight editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german state buys swiss bank data in tax evasion crackdown the western german state of north-rhine westphalia has confirmed buying a cd with information on german tax evaders in switzerland days before the finance ministers from both countries are set to meet on the issue .
-lrb- 27.02.2010 -rrb- swiss politician threatens to expose german officials over tax-dodging a swiss parliamentarian said he would aim to expose german public figures over alleged tax manipulations , if berlin goes ahead with plans to buy stolen data on tax-evaders with swiss bank accounts .
-lrb- 14.02.2010 -rrb- germany steps up hunt for tax evaders german tax investigators are reportedly in france for negotiations with an informant to buy stolen swiss bank data on 1,500 alleged tax evaders .
the move comes amid reports of a fresh offer of data on tax cheats .

it was still dark in her small kitchen and by the light of a kerosene lamp she was making breakfast for her two little granddaughters .
" i have five children and seven grandchildren , " umm sheyma explained , as she set out cups of tea , beakers of milk , some cheese and some bread on a low table .
" our house is a small one , and you can imagine how noisy it gets when all my children and grandchildren are here .
they have food with us every day . "
i wanted to spend the day with umm sheyma and her extended family to get a sense of how the daily challenges of life in baghdad - the intermittent electricity supply , the endless checkpoints , the underlying fear of violence - was shaping people 's views of this election .
just before 8am , the girls picked up their backpacks and set off to walk to school , under the watchful eye of grandma .
blast walls surround umm sheyma 's local market " when my daughters were kids , they used to walk to school alone .
but now there is no security , i trust nothing now .
there is no security even with the guard in school , " she told me .
nostalgia it would be wrong to say that umm sheyma and her family live in fear .
there is laughter and carefree chatter as they made their way through the backstreets overhung by a profusion of electrical cables .
but life in iraq is highly unpredictable .
the threat of violence hangs in the air , and anyone can be in the wrong place at the wrong time .
umm sheyma talks about the past with sense of nostalgia .
" things changed after the fall of saddam because of the explosions and the kidnappings .
we began to worry about our children 's safety . "
few people would say they wanted saddam hussein back .
but many look back with fondness on a simpler , more stable life .
i usually do n't vote but this time i have to because i do n't want to be deceived anymore umm sheyma iraq : key facts and figures guide to groups in iraqi election q & a : iraqi parliamentary polls shopping after dropping the kids off at school , umm sheyma made her way to the market to buy provisions for lunch .
to get there , you have to pass through numerous checkpoints and negotiate your way around blast walls .
the main street is lined with stalls selling fruit and vegetables , wire cages full of live chickens and whole carcasses of lamb hanging in the doorways to butcher 's shops .
the cries of the fishmonger compete with the sounds of generators .
this particular market has been hit by bombers in the past and that , says umm sheyma , wreaks havoc with her budget .
" when there are bombings , prices go up .
plus , it 's election season now and people tend to stock up on food in case of surprises - this also pushes the prices up . "
we bought tomatoes and aubergines .
a little further on , we came across one of umm sheyma 's relatives , selling brightly coloured pickles down a side street , a river of deep black mud .
people seem familiar with each other here .
as we progressed through the market the friendly greetings of the stall holders went some way to offset that thought which is always at the back of one 's mind in baghdad : expect the unexpected .
three generations gather for lunch with dolma on the menu nothing untoward occurred and at 2pm the family gathered back in umm sheyma 's small front room to eat lunch .
she , her husband and her two daughters , sat around a big metal platter placed in the middle of the floor .
umm sheyma had prepared dolma , a dish of onions , aubergines , and tomatoes stuffed with seasoned rice and mince .
assorted grandchildren clambered over laps and tugged on elbows , as everyone tucked in , tearing off pieces of flatbread and scooping up the food .
hopes and fears " i usually do n't vote but this time i have to because i do n't want to be deceived anymore .
the current ruling parties have n't delivered anything these past four or five years , " she said .
it 's scary and they -lsb- iraqi security forces -rsb- also shoot in the air .
that would never have happened if american troops had been with them aya , umm sheyma 's youngest daughter her eldest daughter sheyma has a family of her own .
one of her main concerns is high unemployment .
" we want more jobs .
most of our men are out of work , even though they are well educated , " she said .
but , as so often in iraq , very quickly the conversation returned to the subject of security .
" the situation has got worse recently .
iraqi security forces have started arresting people in their homes , " sheyma told me .
" the other day they launched a search campaign .
we were so frightened .
they come and they arrest people without clear reason , and then release them a couple of months later , " she said .
umm sheyma 's youngest daughter aya is just 19 .
she is about to get married to an officer in the iraqi navy .
she too has had bad experiences since us troops handed over control in the towns and cities to iraqi forces last summer .
" the other day they -lsb- iraqi security forces -rsb- knocked on the door at two o 'clock in the morning , saying that they wanted a cup of tea .
it 's scary and they also shoot in the air . "
" they take away gold items and mobiles .
they took away our rifle recently , and never gave it back . "
" that , " she added , " would never have happened if american troops had been with them . "
like many people in iraq , umm sheyma and her sisters are caught in the middle of conflicting emotions .
they dislike what they see as the american occupation , but have first-hand experience of the more unpredictable behaviour of the new iraqi security forces .
the americans hope that these elections will prove to be a turning point for iraq , an event that will heal sectarian rifts and put the country on the road to greater stability , allowing them to withdraw .
but umm sheyma and her family are apprehensive - what will happen when the americans leave ?
this is the question that everyone is asking .
