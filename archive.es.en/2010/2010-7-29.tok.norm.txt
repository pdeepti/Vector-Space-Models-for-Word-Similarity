a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

" the german economy is on the path to recovery .
the state of the labor market has continued to improve , " said ba chairman frank-juergen weise .
more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .
in june , unemployment shrank in germany by 88,000 down to 3.15 million .
another study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation predicted a rising demand for engineers and nurses in coming years .
they said there will soon be more open jobs than applicants in the fields of research , service and healthcare .

detlef wetzel , second in command at ig metall , also leveled criticism that contractual labor was " driving out more and more stable positions " and creating a work culture of " hiring and firing . "
he warned that the use of lower-paid , short-term contracts would divide companies ' personnel between those with long-term and those with short-term contracts .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan militant leader jalaluddin haqqani " they are speaking to the haqqani brothers .
they say it openly .
the americans know it .
the whole world knows it .
so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isi director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- with prime minister gilani in pakistan itself , the leaks have also not led to an open debate about the country 's afghanistan policy yet - something kamran shafi regrets .
" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .
it 's not happening because the pakistan army is in a preponderant position and they do what they like . "
especially at times like these , when pressure from abroad is increasing , pakistan 's civilian politicians are not likely to take on the army and the intelligence agencies .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .

they say it openly .
the americans know it .

so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "

" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .
it 's not happening because the pakistan army is in a preponderant position and they do what they like . "
especially at times like these , when pressure from abroad is increasing , pakistan 's civilian politicians are not likely to take on the army and the intelligence agencies .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .

the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .

unesco says that project can take place without a threat to the status of germany ’ s world-famous lorelei rock . world heritage body unesco has agreed that plans for a bridge near to a favorite german landmark can go ahead without damaging the area 's status .
the proposed engineering project , near to the town of saint goarshausen , is close to the world-famous lorelei rock – centerpiece of the upper middle rhine valley world heritage site .
the picturesque promontory soars 132-meters above one of the most dangerous parts of the rhine .
it is named after a mythical siren who , according to folklore , lured ship captains to their death against the rocky river floor at its base .
the proposal to build a bridge has sparked intense debate about whether the structure would violate the site 's prestigious unesco world-heritage listing .

there are currently no bridges or tunnels across the rhine on the 85 kilometer -lrb- 52 mile -rrb- stretch between koblenz and mainz , where the lorelei lies .
the entire portion of the rhine valley between koblenz and bingen has enjoyed world heritage status since 2002 .
the bridge project is the second recent german controversy for unesco .
the first also involved a bridge project , this time across the elbe , near the historic heart of dresden which lost its status last year .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .
it 's dropped on the problem and causes a lot of collateral damage to legitimacy of freedoms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.07.2010 proposal for one-state solution gains favor among israelis and palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is facing major obstacles in its efforts to create a palestinian state the idea of a single state solution to the israeli-palestinian problem is gaining renewed currency with a twist : this time around the proposition is supported not only by palestinians but also by israeli right-wingers . analysts say debate in israel as well as among palestinians about a new approach to middle east peace involving a one-state solution reflects a sense on both sides of the arab-israeli divide that us-sponsored efforts to create a palestinian state alongside israel are likely to fail .
even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.07.2010 proposal for one-state solution gains favor among israelis and palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is facing major obstacles in its efforts to create a palestinian state the idea of a single state solution to the israeli-palestinian problem is gaining renewed currency with a twist : this time around the proposition is supported not only by palestinians but also by israeli right-wingers . analysts say debate in israel as well as among palestinians about a new approach to middle east peace involving a one-state solution reflects a sense on both sides of the arab-israeli divide that us-sponsored efforts to create a palestinian state alongside israel are likely to fail .
even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.07.2010 werder bremen battles to keep top stars under threat of mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil is bremen 's crown jewel - but he has his price one has to wonder how werder bremen will remain competitive this season if all the transfer rumors circulating about their players come true .
a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

yet experts warn that short-term contracts threaten stable employment . despite a marginal seasonal rise in germany 's unemployment rate , the labor market is getting back on track , according to germany 's federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- in nuremberg .
the ba announced a 0.1 percent rise in unemployment for the month of july , raising national joblessness to 7.6 percent .
" the german economy is on the path to recovery .
the state of the labor market has continued to improve , " said ba chairman frank-juergen weise .
more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .
in june , unemployment shrank in germany by 88,000 down to 3.15 million .
another study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation predicted a rising demand for engineers and nurses in coming years .
they said there will soon be more open jobs than applicants in the fields of research , service and healthcare .
the study further predicts that , by 2020 , 1.7 million new full-time positions will be created , as well as 820,000 part-time jobs .
by 2020 , the demand for university graduates is expected to rise by 800,000 in comparison to 2003 .
the bertelsmann foundation predicts the number for graduates of technical colleges will go up by 1.1 million .
meanwhile , 800,000 jobs for people with limited or no professional qualifications are set to disappear , and work in construction , mining and clothing sectors will continue to be outsourced overseas .
a division of personnel the ba also stated that the number of short-term contractual labor positions had steadily increased , accounting for the apparent stabilization of the job market .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .

germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "

this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.07.2010 proposal for one-state solution gains favor among israelis and palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is facing major obstacles in its efforts to create a palestinian state the idea of a single state solution to the israeli-palestinian problem is gaining renewed currency with a twist : this time around the proposition is supported not only by palestinians but also by israeli right-wingers . analysts say debate in israel as well as among palestinians about a new approach to middle east peace involving a one-state solution reflects a sense on both sides of the arab-israeli divide that us-sponsored efforts to create a palestinian state alongside israel are likely to fail .
even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.07.2010 werder bremen battles to keep top stars under threat of mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil is bremen 's crown jewel - but he has his price one has to wonder how werder bremen will remain competitive this season if all the transfer rumors circulating about their players come true .
a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .

arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .

while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 29.07.2010 germany praises china during human rights talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has been trying to improve its human rights image german diplomats have given the thumbs up to efforts by china to improve the social and economic standing of chinese citizens .
the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .
one recent survey result found that this year three million of germany ’ s 80 million people will buy an e-book . author : nadine wojcik -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 29.07.2010 german isaf general calls wikileaks document release ' a crime ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general blotz , right , said the leak was ' really irresponsible ' brigadier general josef blotz has criticized the recent online leak of 92,000 mostly classified documents on the afghan conflict .
he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .
it 's dropped on the problem and causes a lot of collateral damage to legitimacy of freedoms .
the only thing that you can be sure that it wo n't do is to solve the problem that it was intended to solve . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .
it 's dropped on the problem and causes a lot of collateral damage to legitimacy of freedoms .
the only thing that you can be sure that it wo n't do is to solve the problem that it was intended to solve . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .

the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.07.2010 ukraine embraces imf with plans for new age of austerity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf 's demands are not expected to be popular ukraine is set for some serious belt-tightening after agreeing to strict budget targets set by the international monetary fund .
the country is fixing relations with the fund after past problems . ukraine expects to receive the first chunk of a 11.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- loan after agreeing to impose tough austerity measures .
a condition of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- loan is that the country 's government must impose a raft of unpopular measures to reduce its budget deficit .
the measures include increasing gas tariffs and raising the retirement age .
" ukraine will ... diligently meet all the obligations it has taken on , " a statement from the ukrainian government said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yanukovych aimed to fix links with the imf the former soviet republic is recovering from a crippling recession , with the economy shrinking by 15 percent last year .
earlier this year , a 12.5 billion euro funding agreement from 2008 was suspended when ukraine passed a law that raised minimum wages and pensions , despite opposition from the imf .
priority since taking office ukrainian president viktor yanukovych , elected in february , has made restoring relations with the imf a priority since taking office .
" ukraine is emerging from a difficult period during which the economy was severely hit by external shocks and exacerbated by domestic vulnerabilities , " said john lipsky , deputy managing director of the imf .

" aldi is only able to offer really low prices by its limited range , through which is generates massive advantages in purchasing , " queck said of the chain , which is also known as trader joe 's in the united states . the discount concept has been so successful that it is responsible for some 44 percent of national grocery sales , according to germany 's gfk market research group .
though it shares the no-frills sector with a number of competitors , aldi 's network of 4,400 outlets makes it hands-down the largest discounter in germany .
planet retail estimates the nation is served by a total of 16,300 discount grocery stores . no secret to aldi 's success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is an indirect decendent of aldi 's no-frills concept " it is a very german phenomenon , " queck said , pointing to germans ' fondness of getting a good deal on food , clothes or electronics - all of which at some point make it onto aldi 's bi-weekly flyer of special sale items . divided into aldi north , which was managed by theo albrecht , and aldi south , which was controlled by his brother karl , total revenues for the aldi brand are estimated to be between 34 billion euros and 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion and $ 69 billion -rrb- . " there are very few people who have left their mark on an entire branch of the economy ; that 's what theo albrecht did , " stefan genth , head of the german retail federation hde , said in a statement .
" the low-cost philosophy has become an integral part of the retail market . " but the influence of aldi 's business model is n't limited to retail sales .
it can be seen at no-frills airlines like ryanair and easyjet , the ubiquitous 1-euro stores that saturate city fringes , call-around numbers to lower communications costs , inexpensive clothing lines and discount electronics stores with low prices and limited selection . but queck said there is no secret behind the success of low-cost operations - whether they are airlines that deliver passengers without serving drinks or grocery stores with a limited range of unbranded products . " it has become very popular for all parts of the german society to shop at aldi , " he said .
" it 's simply because consumers gradually have found that products and product quality is actually very good and that prices are significantly lower than other places .

in its second year of operation , the vaults still have space . the snow cover on the mountainside above the settlement of longyearbyen , around 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- from the north pole , melts to a large extent in summer .
but much of the earth below remains frozen .
the permafrost is one of the main reasons why this spot , 130 meters above sea level , was chosen to house the planet 's " deep freezer " for crop seeds . in 2008 , the bunker in the frosty interior of this arctic mountain , christened the " global seed vault , " initiated by the norwegian government and now run by the global crop diversity trust , was officially opened .
since then , more than half a million seed samples have been stored in what the organizers consider to be the " safest place in the world . " though workmen are drilling inside the 100-meter long tunnel , which leads down to the triple-vault , and shifting permafrost has damaged the facility 's entrance , there 's no danger to the hundreds of thousands of seeds stored inside , according to roland von bothmer , a professor of plant breeding and plant genetics at the swedish university of agriculture . safe from catastrophes , wars and climate change the information about the seeds stored here is generally available on the internet .
the seeds themselves remain the property of whichever body has sent them in , normally a national or regional seed bank or agricultural organization . bildunterschrift : two years after opening its doors , repairs are underway at the seed vault " they have been dried to just around 5 to 6 percent water content , " von bothmer said , holding vacuum-packed seed samples from denmark and india .
" they are brought here in a ' black box . '
we register them and put the box in the seed vault . " it 's important for the vault to protect duplicates , which could be returned to their owners if the originals were to be lost in the event of a disaster , von bothmer said , pointing out that landslides , earthquakes and civil war could all result in the loss of important crop material . refrigeration equipment inside the central storage hall works to push the temperature down to -18 degrees celsius -lrb- -0.4 degrees f -rrb- - the ideal temperature to preserve the seeds for hundreds of years .
seeds of more than a third of the world 's existing varieties of cultivated plants have already been deposited in the vault . " we have around 520,000 seed samples in this vault , " von bothmer said .
" the chamber is not even half full .
that means , when we have all three chambers in operation , we can easily store everything we need . " noah 's ark for plants but the work carried out by von bothmer and his colleagues could bear fruit for humanity even without a world-threatening catastrophe .
genetic erosion , the loss of biodiversity in agricultural crops , is already happening at a worrying rate , according to von bothmer . bildunterschrift : there is still plenty of space for more seed samples " natural and human selection have been working for 10,000 years and wherever it got adapted , it developed new landraces , " he said .
" and we lose that variation a lot in the field because farmers in most areas prefer to cultivate modern varieties with a very narrow genetic background . " he added that the fao world food summit last year said world food production would have to be increased by more than 70 percent by 2050 .
at the same time , the area available for agriculture is declining .
that means we need more efficient and sustainable farming , with plant breeding and plant genetics playing an important role , von bothmer said . climate change poses another challenge . " it will be drier in many areas , there will be more rain in others .
there will be a new spectrum of diseases , new pests , all over the world .
and we need to have genes that are resistant , for example , in order to cope with these new conditions coming in .
some areas will be winners , others losers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 29.07.2010 pressure grows on duisburg mayor to resign over love parade deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is looking for someone to take the blame germany is looking for someone to take the blame in the tragic crushing deaths of 21 love parade festival-goers .
a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .

" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 29.07.2010 pressure grows on duisburg mayor to resign over love parade deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is looking for someone to take the blame germany is looking for someone to take the blame in the tragic crushing deaths of 21 love parade festival-goers .
a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

bands and indigenous musicians from around the world gather here every year in july . unlike so many music festivals which squeeze visitors into industrial concert venues , the rainforest world music festival allows music lovers to enjoy its loud rhythms in the heart of the one of the world 's oldest rain forests of the malaysian borneo jungle : in the sarawak cultural village , a living museum showcasing the heritage and history of the iban , bidayuh , orang ulu , penan and other ethnic groups . the magic of this festival is that it invites music lovers to choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debu -lrb- indonesia -rrb- performing on the first day of the festival from a variety of daytime workshops and interactive ethnomusicology lectures in the afternoon , where performing artists of similar instruments or interests are brought together to demonstrate their craft and find a common musical voice .
" the instruments that we have here are mostly made of wood and bamboo , " an official at the dewan lagenda said .
" the material used comes from the jungle .
that is what the rainforest festival is all about .
we make use of what we have in our jungle to make instruments .
the instrument that i have with us now is called pratuon ’ k " . the workshops are the real heart of the rainforest world music festival .
held at locations like the iban longhouse or the dewan lagenda , visitors sit next to each other , legs folded or outstretched , on floors made from strips of wood .
the enthusiasm is contagious and before long the crowd is drawn into the musicians ’ passionate performances , clapping along to their soulful rhythms and vibrant beats . today , the legendary former headhunters of malaysian borneo live peaceful agrarian lives , but they still like playing the traditional tunes they did when the headhunters returned with the head of the enemy . the 13th rainforest world music festival held this month featured 20 performers from countries as diverse as china , indonesia , bulgaria , canada , france and portugal and attracting around 20,000 spectators from around the globe .
austrian nanophysicist ille gebeshuber was one of them .

" the first thing that amazed me when i arrived here was the variety of instruments that i discovered - that i think everybody is discovering - especially during the workshops , because you can see everything from chinese or japanese bongos to the steel pan .
there is really a variety of traditional instruments " . after the workshops , the heavens opened up .
thunder and heavy rain accompanied most of the evening performances .
but what is a rain forest music festival without some rain ? the grand finale featured all 20 bands together on stage , each performing about a minute of their music and then jamming all together .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan militant leader jalaluddin haqqani " they are speaking to the haqqani brothers .
they say it openly .
the americans know it .
the whole world knows it .
so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isi director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- with prime minister gilani in pakistan itself , the leaks have also not led to an open debate about the country 's afghanistan policy yet - something kamran shafi regrets .
" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .
it 's not happening because the pakistan army is in a preponderant position and they do what they like . "
especially at times like these , when pressure from abroad is increasing , pakistan 's civilian politicians are not likely to take on the army and the intelligence agencies .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan militant leader jalaluddin haqqani " they are speaking to the haqqani brothers .
they say it openly .
the americans know it .
the whole world knows it .
so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isi director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- with prime minister gilani in pakistan itself , the leaks have also not led to an open debate about the country 's afghanistan policy yet - something kamran shafi regrets .
" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .
it 's not happening because the pakistan army is in a preponderant position and they do what they like . "
especially at times like these , when pressure from abroad is increasing , pakistan 's civilian politicians are not likely to take on the army and the intelligence agencies .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.07.2010 werder bremen battles to keep top stars under threat of mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil is bremen 's crown jewel - but he has his price one has to wonder how werder bremen will remain competitive this season if all the transfer rumors circulating about their players come true .
a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .
one recent survey result found that this year three million of germany ’ s 80 million people will buy an e-book . author : nadine wojcik -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

bands and indigenous musicians from around the world gather here every year in july . unlike so many music festivals which squeeze visitors into industrial concert venues , the rainforest world music festival allows music lovers to enjoy its loud rhythms in the heart of the one of the world 's oldest rain forests of the malaysian borneo jungle : in the sarawak cultural village , a living museum showcasing the heritage and history of the iban , bidayuh , orang ulu , penan and other ethnic groups . the magic of this festival is that it invites music lovers to choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debu -lrb- indonesia -rrb- performing on the first day of the festival from a variety of daytime workshops and interactive ethnomusicology lectures in the afternoon , where performing artists of similar instruments or interests are brought together to demonstrate their craft and find a common musical voice .
" the instruments that we have here are mostly made of wood and bamboo , " an official at the dewan lagenda said .
" the material used comes from the jungle .
that is what the rainforest festival is all about .
we make use of what we have in our jungle to make instruments .
the instrument that i have with us now is called pratuon ’ k " . the workshops are the real heart of the rainforest world music festival .
held at locations like the iban longhouse or the dewan lagenda , visitors sit next to each other , legs folded or outstretched , on floors made from strips of wood .
the enthusiasm is contagious and before long the crowd is drawn into the musicians ’ passionate performances , clapping along to their soulful rhythms and vibrant beats . today , the legendary former headhunters of malaysian borneo live peaceful agrarian lives , but they still like playing the traditional tunes they did when the headhunters returned with the head of the enemy . the 13th rainforest world music festival held this month featured 20 performers from countries as diverse as china , indonesia , bulgaria , canada , france and portugal and attracting around 20,000 spectators from around the globe .
austrian nanophysicist ille gebeshuber was one of them .
" i am a university professor of physics at the university kebangsaan malaysia .

" the first thing that amazed me when i arrived here was the variety of instruments that i discovered - that i think everybody is discovering - especially during the workshops , because you can see everything from chinese or japanese bongos to the steel pan .
there is really a variety of traditional instruments " . after the workshops , the heavens opened up .
thunder and heavy rain accompanied most of the evening performances .
but what is a rain forest music festival without some rain ? the grand finale featured all 20 bands together on stage , each performing about a minute of their music and then jamming all together .
memories of the three-day world music extravaganza blurred and came together , and the audience was determined to be back again for the next rainforest world music festival . author : helena de gouveia editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .
one recent survey result found that this year three million of germany ’ s 80 million people will buy an e-book . author : nadine wojcik -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.07.2010 werder bremen battles to keep top stars under threat of mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil is bremen 's crown jewel - but he has his price one has to wonder how werder bremen will remain competitive this season if all the transfer rumors circulating about their players come true .
a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 29.07.2010 germany praises china during human rights talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has been trying to improve its human rights image german diplomats have given the thumbs up to efforts by china to improve the social and economic standing of chinese citizens .
the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

yet experts warn that short-term contracts threaten stable employment . despite a marginal seasonal rise in germany 's unemployment rate , the labor market is getting back on track , according to germany 's federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- in nuremberg .
the ba announced a 0.1 percent rise in unemployment for the month of july , raising national joblessness to 7.6 percent .
" the german economy is on the path to recovery .
the state of the labor market has continued to improve , " said ba chairman frank-juergen weise .
more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .
in june , unemployment shrank in germany by 88,000 down to 3.15 million .
another study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation predicted a rising demand for engineers and nurses in coming years .
they said there will soon be more open jobs than applicants in the fields of research , service and healthcare .
the study further predicts that , by 2020 , 1.7 million new full-time positions will be created , as well as 820,000 part-time jobs .
by 2020 , the demand for university graduates is expected to rise by 800,000 in comparison to 2003 .
the bertelsmann foundation predicts the number for graduates of technical colleges will go up by 1.1 million .
meanwhile , 800,000 jobs for people with limited or no professional qualifications are set to disappear , and work in construction , mining and clothing sectors will continue to be outsourced overseas .
a division of personnel the ba also stated that the number of short-term contractual labor positions had steadily increased , accounting for the apparent stabilization of the job market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that short-term contractual labor damages the job market jutta krellmann , a labor market expert for the left party , warned the federal government that " your cheers over the decrease in unemployment figures ignores the fact that this drop in unemployment is greatly due to contractual labor , which is accelerating the spiral of low pay . "
detlef wetzel , second in command at ig metall , also leveled criticism that contractual labor was " driving out more and more stable positions " and creating a work culture of " hiring and firing . "
he warned that the use of lower-paid , short-term contracts would divide companies ' personnel between those with long-term and those with short-term contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 29.07.2010 france launches long-delayed online anti-piracy agency hadopi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hadopi aims to counter online piracy a new french law creates a " three strikes " rule to go after those who illegally download copyrighted content .
but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .
it 's dropped on the problem and causes a lot of collateral damage to legitimacy of freedoms .
the only thing that you can be sure that it wo n't do is to solve the problem that it was intended to solve . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 29.07.2010 germany praises china during human rights talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has been trying to improve its human rights image german diplomats have given the thumbs up to efforts by china to improve the social and economic standing of chinese citizens .
the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .

this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .

this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .

" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 29.07.2010 state government moves to keep extremists out of pre-schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pre-school in barkow needed 15,000 euros to stay open after a member of a far-right party nearly took over a cash-strapped pre-school in northern germany , the state government moved quickly to stop it from happening again .
but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs .

for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .

police arrested environmental activists , who claim they were n't involved . a demonstration in a moscow suburb turned violent wednesday night as 100 people threw stones and smoke bombs at the local town hall to protest against the razing of the local forest , moscow regional police said thursday .
russian television reports showed the administration building in khimki surrounded by smoke and broken glass after a permitted rally in which hundreds of people denounced plans to put a new highway through the local forest .
police say a gang of 90 unidentified suspects met up there after the rally .
" they shouted slogans in support of the khimki forest .
shots were fired and glass bottles were thrown , " yevgeny gildeyev , spokesman for the moscow police , told echo of moscow radio .
khimki police also said the unidentified men spray-painted " save russian forests " all over the building 's facade .
when police arrived on the scene , no one was to be found , according to gildeyev .
" we have information that -lsb- the protesters -rsb- went to the station and left for moscow , " he said .
activists detained police detained nine environmental activists who have lived in the forest in recent weeks to protest plans to raze it .
the activists maintained they had played no role in the attacks , which they assert were committed by extremists .
" i am truly disappointed that extremists and provocateurs are more and more mixing themselves up with the true ecologists and genuine defenders of the khimki forest , " russian mp anton belyakov from the a just russia party told echo of moscow .
" i am sure that the police will be able to see which ones are trying to destabilize the situation under cover of protecting the khimki forest , " he added .
the new moscow-saint petersburg highway planned through the forest is intended to relieve chronic traffic congestion in the area .
the khimki forest has been a volatile topic since the plans were announced .
a local journalist who reported on the issue was beaten and left brain-damaged in 2008 .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .

conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .

few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan militant leader jalaluddin haqqani " they are speaking to the haqqani brothers .
they say it openly .
the americans know it .
the whole world knows it .
so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isi director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- with prime minister gilani in pakistan itself , the leaks have also not led to an open debate about the country 's afghanistan policy yet - something kamran shafi regrets .
" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .
it 's not happening because the pakistan army is in a preponderant position and they do what they like . "
especially at times like these , when pressure from abroad is increasing , pakistan 's civilian politicians are not likely to take on the army and the intelligence agencies .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .

so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .
one recent survey result found that this year three million of germany ’ s 80 million people will buy an e-book . author : nadine wojcik -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

in its second year of operation , the vaults still have space . the snow cover on the mountainside above the settlement of longyearbyen , around 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- from the north pole , melts to a large extent in summer .
but much of the earth below remains frozen .
the permafrost is one of the main reasons why this spot , 130 meters above sea level , was chosen to house the planet 's " deep freezer " for crop seeds . in 2008 , the bunker in the frosty interior of this arctic mountain , christened the " global seed vault , " initiated by the norwegian government and now run by the global crop diversity trust , was officially opened .
since then , more than half a million seed samples have been stored in what the organizers consider to be the " safest place in the world . " though workmen are drilling inside the 100-meter long tunnel , which leads down to the triple-vault , and shifting permafrost has damaged the facility 's entrance , there 's no danger to the hundreds of thousands of seeds stored inside , according to roland von bothmer , a professor of plant breeding and plant genetics at the swedish university of agriculture . safe from catastrophes , wars and climate change the information about the seeds stored here is generally available on the internet .
the seeds themselves remain the property of whichever body has sent them in , normally a national or regional seed bank or agricultural organization . bildunterschrift : two years after opening its doors , repairs are underway at the seed vault " they have been dried to just around 5 to 6 percent water content , " von bothmer said , holding vacuum-packed seed samples from denmark and india .
" they are brought here in a ' black box . '
we register them and put the box in the seed vault . " it 's important for the vault to protect duplicates , which could be returned to their owners if the originals were to be lost in the event of a disaster , von bothmer said , pointing out that landslides , earthquakes and civil war could all result in the loss of important crop material . refrigeration equipment inside the central storage hall works to push the temperature down to -18 degrees celsius -lrb- -0.4 degrees f -rrb- - the ideal temperature to preserve the seeds for hundreds of years .
seeds of more than a third of the world 's existing varieties of cultivated plants have already been deposited in the vault . " we have around 520,000 seed samples in this vault , " von bothmer said .
" the chamber is not even half full .
that means , when we have all three chambers in operation , we can easily store everything we need . " noah 's ark for plants but the work carried out by von bothmer and his colleagues could bear fruit for humanity even without a world-threatening catastrophe .
genetic erosion , the loss of biodiversity in agricultural crops , is already happening at a worrying rate , according to von bothmer . bildunterschrift : there is still plenty of space for more seed samples " natural and human selection have been working for 10,000 years and wherever it got adapted , it developed new landraces , " he said .
" and we lose that variation a lot in the field because farmers in most areas prefer to cultivate modern varieties with a very narrow genetic background . " he added that the fao world food summit last year said world food production would have to be increased by more than 70 percent by 2050 .
at the same time , the area available for agriculture is declining .
that means we need more efficient and sustainable farming , with plant breeding and plant genetics playing an important role , von bothmer said . climate change poses another challenge . " it will be drier in many areas , there will be more rain in others .
there will be a new spectrum of diseases , new pests , all over the world .
and we need to have genes that are resistant , for example , in order to cope with these new conditions coming in .
some areas will be winners , others losers .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

unesco says that project can take place without a threat to the status of germany ’ s world-famous lorelei rock . world heritage body unesco has agreed that plans for a bridge near to a favorite german landmark can go ahead without damaging the area 's status .
the proposed engineering project , near to the town of saint goarshausen , is close to the world-famous lorelei rock – centerpiece of the upper middle rhine valley world heritage site .
the picturesque promontory soars 132-meters above one of the most dangerous parts of the rhine .
it is named after a mythical siren who , according to folklore , lured ship captains to their death against the rocky river floor at its base .
the proposal to build a bridge has sparked intense debate about whether the structure would violate the site 's prestigious unesco world-heritage listing .
critics warned there would be considerable environmental destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rock is named after a siren who lured ships onto rocks however , the panel at the 34th annual world heritage meeting in brasilia agreed that the concept of the bridge was compatible with lorelei 's world heritage designation .
detailed plans needed according to the german state of rhineland-palatinate 's economics ministry , a detailed plan will have to be submitted for the bridge project to retain unesco approval for the area .
" we wanted both .
world heritage status and a bridge , " said state transport minister hendrik hering .
" rhineland palatinate can finally plan , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden lost its status last year , over a bridge project unesco wanted to see further plans to ensure the bridge was " visually acceptable and that it complies with the exceptional universal values of a world heritage site , " the state government said .
there are currently no bridges or tunnels across the rhine on the 85 kilometer -lrb- 52 mile -rrb- stretch between koblenz and mainz , where the lorelei lies .
the entire portion of the rhine valley between koblenz and bingen has enjoyed world heritage status since 2002 .
the bridge project is the second recent german controversy for unesco .
the first also involved a bridge project , this time across the elbe , near the historic heart of dresden which lost its status last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 29.07.2010 france launches long-delayed online anti-piracy agency hadopi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hadopi aims to counter online piracy a new french law creates a " three strikes " rule to go after those who illegally download copyrighted content .
but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .
it 's dropped on the problem and causes a lot of collateral damage to legitimacy of freedoms .
the only thing that you can be sure that it wo n't do is to solve the problem that it was intended to solve . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .

unesco says that project can take place without a threat to the status of germany ’ s world-famous lorelei rock . world heritage body unesco has agreed that plans for a bridge near to a favorite german landmark can go ahead without damaging the area 's status .
the proposed engineering project , near to the town of saint goarshausen , is close to the world-famous lorelei rock – centerpiece of the upper middle rhine valley world heritage site .
the picturesque promontory soars 132-meters above one of the most dangerous parts of the rhine .
it is named after a mythical siren who , according to folklore , lured ship captains to their death against the rocky river floor at its base .
the proposal to build a bridge has sparked intense debate about whether the structure would violate the site 's prestigious unesco world-heritage listing .
critics warned there would be considerable environmental destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rock is named after a siren who lured ships onto rocks however , the panel at the 34th annual world heritage meeting in brasilia agreed that the concept of the bridge was compatible with lorelei 's world heritage designation .
detailed plans needed according to the german state of rhineland-palatinate 's economics ministry , a detailed plan will have to be submitted for the bridge project to retain unesco approval for the area .
" we wanted both .
world heritage status and a bridge , " said state transport minister hendrik hering .
" rhineland palatinate can finally plan , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden lost its status last year , over a bridge project unesco wanted to see further plans to ensure the bridge was " visually acceptable and that it complies with the exceptional universal values of a world heritage site , " the state government said .
there are currently no bridges or tunnels across the rhine on the 85 kilometer -lrb- 52 mile -rrb- stretch between koblenz and mainz , where the lorelei lies .
the entire portion of the rhine valley between koblenz and bingen has enjoyed world heritage status since 2002 .
the bridge project is the second recent german controversy for unesco .
the first also involved a bridge project , this time across the elbe , near the historic heart of dresden which lost its status last year .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .

the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

police arrested environmental activists , who claim they were n't involved . a demonstration in a moscow suburb turned violent wednesday night as 100 people threw stones and smoke bombs at the local town hall to protest against the razing of the local forest , moscow regional police said thursday .
russian television reports showed the administration building in khimki surrounded by smoke and broken glass after a permitted rally in which hundreds of people denounced plans to put a new highway through the local forest .
police say a gang of 90 unidentified suspects met up there after the rally .
" they shouted slogans in support of the khimki forest .
shots were fired and glass bottles were thrown , " yevgeny gildeyev , spokesman for the moscow police , told echo of moscow radio .
khimki police also said the unidentified men spray-painted " save russian forests " all over the building 's facade .
when police arrived on the scene , no one was to be found , according to gildeyev .
" we have information that -lsb- the protesters -rsb- went to the station and left for moscow , " he said .
activists detained police detained nine environmental activists who have lived in the forest in recent weeks to protest plans to raze it .
the activists maintained they had played no role in the attacks , which they assert were committed by extremists .
" i am truly disappointed that extremists and provocateurs are more and more mixing themselves up with the true ecologists and genuine defenders of the khimki forest , " russian mp anton belyakov from the a just russia party told echo of moscow .
" i am sure that the police will be able to see which ones are trying to destabilize the situation under cover of protecting the khimki forest , " he added .

the khimki forest has been a volatile topic since the plans were announced .
a local journalist who reported on the issue was beaten and left brain-damaged in 2008 .

police arrested environmental activists , who claim they were n't involved . a demonstration in a moscow suburb turned violent wednesday night as 100 people threw stones and smoke bombs at the local town hall to protest against the razing of the local forest , moscow regional police said thursday .
russian television reports showed the administration building in khimki surrounded by smoke and broken glass after a permitted rally in which hundreds of people denounced plans to put a new highway through the local forest .
police say a gang of 90 unidentified suspects met up there after the rally .
" they shouted slogans in support of the khimki forest .
shots were fired and glass bottles were thrown , " yevgeny gildeyev , spokesman for the moscow police , told echo of moscow radio .
khimki police also said the unidentified men spray-painted " save russian forests " all over the building 's facade .
when police arrived on the scene , no one was to be found , according to gildeyev .
" we have information that -lsb- the protesters -rsb- went to the station and left for moscow , " he said .
activists detained police detained nine environmental activists who have lived in the forest in recent weeks to protest plans to raze it .
the activists maintained they had played no role in the attacks , which they assert were committed by extremists .
" i am truly disappointed that extremists and provocateurs are more and more mixing themselves up with the true ecologists and genuine defenders of the khimki forest , " russian mp anton belyakov from the a just russia party told echo of moscow .
" i am sure that the police will be able to see which ones are trying to destabilize the situation under cover of protecting the khimki forest , " he added .
the new moscow-saint petersburg highway planned through the forest is intended to relieve chronic traffic congestion in the area .
the khimki forest has been a volatile topic since the plans were announced .
a local journalist who reported on the issue was beaten and left brain-damaged in 2008 .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .

the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .
in june , unemployment shrank in germany by 88,000 down to 3.15 million .
another study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation predicted a rising demand for engineers and nurses in coming years .
they said there will soon be more open jobs than applicants in the fields of research , service and healthcare .
the study further predicts that , by 2020 , 1.7 million new full-time positions will be created , as well as 820,000 part-time jobs .
by 2020 , the demand for university graduates is expected to rise by 800,000 in comparison to 2003 .
the bertelsmann foundation predicts the number for graduates of technical colleges will go up by 1.1 million .
meanwhile , 800,000 jobs for people with limited or no professional qualifications are set to disappear , and work in construction , mining and clothing sectors will continue to be outsourced overseas .
a division of personnel the ba also stated that the number of short-term contractual labor positions had steadily increased , accounting for the apparent stabilization of the job market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that short-term contractual labor damages the job market jutta krellmann , a labor market expert for the left party , warned the federal government that " your cheers over the decrease in unemployment figures ignores the fact that this drop in unemployment is greatly due to contractual labor , which is accelerating the spiral of low pay . "
detlef wetzel , second in command at ig metall , also leveled criticism that contractual labor was " driving out more and more stable positions " and creating a work culture of " hiring and firing . "
he warned that the use of lower-paid , short-term contracts would divide companies ' personnel between those with long-term and those with short-term contracts .

unesco says that project can take place without a threat to the status of germany ’ s world-famous lorelei rock . world heritage body unesco has agreed that plans for a bridge near to a favorite german landmark can go ahead without damaging the area 's status .
the proposed engineering project , near to the town of saint goarshausen , is close to the world-famous lorelei rock – centerpiece of the upper middle rhine valley world heritage site .
the picturesque promontory soars 132-meters above one of the most dangerous parts of the rhine .
it is named after a mythical siren who , according to folklore , lured ship captains to their death against the rocky river floor at its base .
the proposal to build a bridge has sparked intense debate about whether the structure would violate the site 's prestigious unesco world-heritage listing .
critics warned there would be considerable environmental destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rock is named after a siren who lured ships onto rocks however , the panel at the 34th annual world heritage meeting in brasilia agreed that the concept of the bridge was compatible with lorelei 's world heritage designation .
detailed plans needed according to the german state of rhineland-palatinate 's economics ministry , a detailed plan will have to be submitted for the bridge project to retain unesco approval for the area .
" we wanted both .
world heritage status and a bridge , " said state transport minister hendrik hering .
" rhineland palatinate can finally plan , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden lost its status last year , over a bridge project unesco wanted to see further plans to ensure the bridge was " visually acceptable and that it complies with the exceptional universal values of a world heritage site , " the state government said .
there are currently no bridges or tunnels across the rhine on the 85 kilometer -lrb- 52 mile -rrb- stretch between koblenz and mainz , where the lorelei lies .
the entire portion of the rhine valley between koblenz and bingen has enjoyed world heritage status since 2002 .
the bridge project is the second recent german controversy for unesco .
the first also involved a bridge project , this time across the elbe , near the historic heart of dresden which lost its status last year .

but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .
it 's dropped on the problem and causes a lot of collateral damage to legitimacy of freedoms .
the only thing that you can be sure that it wo n't do is to solve the problem that it was intended to solve . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .
one recent survey result found that this year three million of germany ’ s 80 million people will buy an e-book . author : nadine wojcik -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .

what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .

and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan militant leader jalaluddin haqqani " they are speaking to the haqqani brothers .
they say it openly .
the americans know it .
the whole world knows it .
so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isi director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- with prime minister gilani in pakistan itself , the leaks have also not led to an open debate about the country 's afghanistan policy yet - something kamran shafi regrets .
" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .
it 's not happening because the pakistan army is in a preponderant position and they do what they like . "
especially at times like these , when pressure from abroad is increasing , pakistan 's civilian politicians are not likely to take on the army and the intelligence agencies .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

meanwhile , 800,000 jobs for people with limited or no professional qualifications are set to disappear , and work in construction , mining and clothing sectors will continue to be outsourced overseas .
a division of personnel the ba also stated that the number of short-term contractual labor positions had steadily increased , accounting for the apparent stabilization of the job market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that short-term contractual labor damages the job market jutta krellmann , a labor market expert for the left party , warned the federal government that " your cheers over the decrease in unemployment figures ignores the fact that this drop in unemployment is greatly due to contractual labor , which is accelerating the spiral of low pay . "
detlef wetzel , second in command at ig metall , also leveled criticism that contractual labor was " driving out more and more stable positions " and creating a work culture of " hiring and firing . "
he warned that the use of lower-paid , short-term contracts would divide companies ' personnel between those with long-term and those with short-term contracts .

the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.07.2010 proposal for one-state solution gains favor among israelis and palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is facing major obstacles in its efforts to create a palestinian state the idea of a single state solution to the israeli-palestinian problem is gaining renewed currency with a twist : this time around the proposition is supported not only by palestinians but also by israeli right-wingers . analysts say debate in israel as well as among palestinians about a new approach to middle east peace involving a one-state solution reflects a sense on both sides of the arab-israeli divide that us-sponsored efforts to create a palestinian state alongside israel are likely to fail .
even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .

palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .

a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .

so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

" aldi is only able to offer really low prices by its limited range , through which is generates massive advantages in purchasing , " queck said of the chain , which is also known as trader joe 's in the united states . the discount concept has been so successful that it is responsible for some 44 percent of national grocery sales , according to germany 's gfk market research group .
though it shares the no-frills sector with a number of competitors , aldi 's network of 4,400 outlets makes it hands-down the largest discounter in germany .
planet retail estimates the nation is served by a total of 16,300 discount grocery stores . no secret to aldi 's success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is an indirect decendent of aldi 's no-frills concept " it is a very german phenomenon , " queck said , pointing to germans ' fondness of getting a good deal on food , clothes or electronics - all of which at some point make it onto aldi 's bi-weekly flyer of special sale items . divided into aldi north , which was managed by theo albrecht , and aldi south , which was controlled by his brother karl , total revenues for the aldi brand are estimated to be between 34 billion euros and 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion and $ 69 billion -rrb- . " there are very few people who have left their mark on an entire branch of the economy ; that 's what theo albrecht did , " stefan genth , head of the german retail federation hde , said in a statement .
" the low-cost philosophy has become an integral part of the retail market . " but the influence of aldi 's business model is n't limited to retail sales .
it can be seen at no-frills airlines like ryanair and easyjet , the ubiquitous 1-euro stores that saturate city fringes , call-around numbers to lower communications costs , inexpensive clothing lines and discount electronics stores with low prices and limited selection . but queck said there is no secret behind the success of low-cost operations - whether they are airlines that deliver passengers without serving drinks or grocery stores with a limited range of unbranded products . " it has become very popular for all parts of the german society to shop at aldi , " he said .
" it 's simply because consumers gradually have found that products and product quality is actually very good and that prices are significantly lower than other places .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

the ba announced a 0.1 percent rise in unemployment for the month of july , raising national joblessness to 7.6 percent .
" the german economy is on the path to recovery .
the state of the labor market has continued to improve , " said ba chairman frank-juergen weise .
more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .
in june , unemployment shrank in germany by 88,000 down to 3.15 million .
another study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation predicted a rising demand for engineers and nurses in coming years .
they said there will soon be more open jobs than applicants in the fields of research , service and healthcare .
the study further predicts that , by 2020 , 1.7 million new full-time positions will be created , as well as 820,000 part-time jobs .
by 2020 , the demand for university graduates is expected to rise by 800,000 in comparison to 2003 .
the bertelsmann foundation predicts the number for graduates of technical colleges will go up by 1.1 million .
meanwhile , 800,000 jobs for people with limited or no professional qualifications are set to disappear , and work in construction , mining and clothing sectors will continue to be outsourced overseas .
a division of personnel the ba also stated that the number of short-term contractual labor positions had steadily increased , accounting for the apparent stabilization of the job market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that short-term contractual labor damages the job market jutta krellmann , a labor market expert for the left party , warned the federal government that " your cheers over the decrease in unemployment figures ignores the fact that this drop in unemployment is greatly due to contractual labor , which is accelerating the spiral of low pay . "
detlef wetzel , second in command at ig metall , also leveled criticism that contractual labor was " driving out more and more stable positions " and creating a work culture of " hiring and firing . "
he warned that the use of lower-paid , short-term contracts would divide companies ' personnel between those with long-term and those with short-term contracts .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .

if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

yet experts warn that short-term contracts threaten stable employment . despite a marginal seasonal rise in germany 's unemployment rate , the labor market is getting back on track , according to germany 's federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- in nuremberg .
the ba announced a 0.1 percent rise in unemployment for the month of july , raising national joblessness to 7.6 percent .
" the german economy is on the path to recovery .
the state of the labor market has continued to improve , " said ba chairman frank-juergen weise .
more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .
in june , unemployment shrank in germany by 88,000 down to 3.15 million .
another study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation predicted a rising demand for engineers and nurses in coming years .

by 2020 , the demand for university graduates is expected to rise by 800,000 in comparison to 2003 .

meanwhile , 800,000 jobs for people with limited or no professional qualifications are set to disappear , and work in construction , mining and clothing sectors will continue to be outsourced overseas .

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .
one recent survey result found that this year three million of germany ’ s 80 million people will buy an e-book . author : nadine wojcik -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de digital wave threatens germany 's fixed-price book world the german book price fixing scheme has been in place for more than 120 years .
but the publishing world faces new challenges now that e-books and electronic reading devices have been thrown into the mix .
-lrb- 29.05.2010 -rrb- e-readers promise bright future for print media after lengthy delays , the ipad finally hit german stores on friday .
now apple appears poised to take command of the e-reader market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.07.2010 werder bremen battles to keep top stars under threat of mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil is bremen 's crown jewel - but he has his price one has to wonder how werder bremen will remain competitive this season if all the transfer rumors circulating about their players come true .
a number of top stars could leave while few new signings are on the horizon . with more column inches being devoted to the players most likely to leave than those most likely to join , werder bremen - which prides itself on its exciting , attacking soccer - could be digging deep into their reserves should the summer sales deplete their squad and few replacements are found .
it is unlikely that the club 's sporting director klaus allofs will allow anyone to leave without having new players lined up to take their place .
but as the silly season gets into full swing and all manner of names and inflated sums of money start flying around , werder bremen 's weserstadion is being portrayed as a department store with its doors flung open and signs screaming ' bargains galore ' adorning the walls .
standing on a pedestal surrounded by slogans explaining how owning him will change your life , is mesut oezil .
the youngster is the club 's most valuable asset right now and that fact is slowly dawning on the bremen hierarchy .
after a period of indecision and a rash of conflicting messages , the 21-year-old germany international is now apparently up for sale as werder bid to cash in before the midfield sensation of the 2010 world cup leaves for nothing at the end of his contract next season .
bremen fears departure of creative midfielders oezil , who only a couple of weeks ago said he would honor his contract with bremen , could find himself at the center of one of the most frenzied bidding wars of the summer .
the fact that clubs like barcelona , manchester united and real madrid have n't started biting lumps out of each other yet is all down to the uncertainty surrounding oezil 's availability .
once werder finally go public with a price - which could be as low as 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- - expect a bunch of sweaty 50-year olds in shiny suits to embark on a free-for-all .
it wo n't be pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen would certainly miss marin and oezil should oezil leave , and allofs decides against leaving a mesut-shaped hole at the creative heart of the bremen side , werder will be looking for a tricky youngster to pull the attacking strings .
instead of hitting the market themselves , they might just turn to the one they already have in reserve .
however , that man in question - marko marin - plays on the wing rather than in the middle and could be picked up on the cheap as a mesut substitute by those clubs who lost out on the authentic version .
manchester united are already said to have cast a beady eye over the young man branded the german messi , just in case deep spanish pockets beat them to the real thing .
so if bremen somehow find themselves missing two nippy creative midfielders , they will certainly have to find at least one replacement .
one which could add the zip they need would be hatem ben arfa , who is one of the few players that the werder hierarchy have admitted to being interested in .
the marseille winger , who won the french title last season following his transfer to the stade velodrome from lyon in 2008 , is also being tracked by english premiership club newcastle and turkish giants galatasaray .
whether england or turkey will appeal ahead of germany remains to be seen .
international defender mertesacker targeted by arsenal once bremen find a replacement for one or both of their creative flair players , should they leave , they might then have to start looking for a tall , lumbering center-half that can take over from the potentially arsenal-bound per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker could be towering over attackers in london the gunners have been watching developments with interest ever since mertesacker put in some solid , yet typically unspectacular performances in south africa this summer .
arsenal coach arsene wenger usually asks little else from his central defenders so mertesacker could fit the role at the heart of the gunners ' defense to a tee .
while nervously scanning the back pages for news of the latest raids on their biggest stars , werder bremen have forgotten to keep an eye on what striker markus rosenberg has been up to .
the 27-year-old swede has just one year of his current bremen contract to go and a host of french , greek and spanish clubs are hoping to sign him up .
covetous glances from scotland have also been recorded with both glasgow rangers and celtic aware of his situation .
while not a regular last season - or a prolific goal scorer - rosenberg 's departure would leave a gap in werder 's attacking options .
additions to squad barely quicken the pulse with some of the team 's most well-known players on the verge of leaving , werder bremen fans may be a little concerned at the caliber of the players who have agreed to join the club for the new season .
austrian striker marko arnautovic may have arrived from inter milan claiming to be a serie a and champions league winner but the 21-year-old really only managed three games in his one and only season with internazionale and so is only a champion by association .
however , his scoring exploits with fc twente enschede in the netherlands were sufficient to convince jose mourinho to buy him for inter and he may prove to be just as prolific in the bundesliga , a league closer to his cultural and footballing roots than italy .
werder will certainly be hoping so .
another attacker joining the first team squad is felix kroos , an 18-year-old striker who has played in the regional and lower leagues of the bundesliga for hansa rostock and , more recently , werder 's second string .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vranjes returns to bremen to add some experience joining kroos in taking a step up is kevin schindler , a 22-year-old who joins the first team from bremen 's reserves with an impressive 10 goals to his name .
schindler actually featured for the first team in the 2007 and 2008 seasons , even winning the league cup , before returning to the reserves and spending time at rostock and augsburg .
all-in-all , if bremen can hang onto their big names then it could be a season like many others ; a few barn-storming performances with goals a-plenty , a decent run in one of the cups , a courageous early tilt at the title followed by a winter collapse and disappointing run-in .
if they lose players like oezil , mertesacker and marin , they may do even worse .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 29.07.2010 german e-book market slow to grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans are still choosing the traditional book over the electronic one publishers , booksellers and industry insiders agree : the e-book is set to turn the entire industry on its head .
but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library . " who is a real publisher ? when it comes to online booksellers like amazon and the apple ibook store , it ’ s becoming increasingly unclear who counts as a publisher and who does not .
dorothee ritz is the online and consumer general manager for microsoft germany .
she believes that media question will not be nearly so important in future . " we 're a software company , not a media company by any means , but certainly to some extent we are a publisher – in the sense that all the consumers who are on our platforms are creating an incredible amount of content , " said ritz .
" and i think we do publish , in that we combine the content that ’ s already out there with what today might be called the classic book form , and so that creates entirely new and exciting forms of books and content . " traditional book publishers need to adapt despite the slow growth of the german e-book market , it is still set to challenge the traditional book market in the future .
as books are increasingly digitized and sold online , the future of bookstores is becoming uncertain .
the bookstore osiander in southern germany has decided to adapt to the situation rather than give up .
the mid-sized firm has 22 branches and has recently established its own online e-book store . " when people buy e-books now , they have to go to different providers and have an account with each , " said hermann-arndt riethmueller , osiander ’ s ceo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but when they buy e-books through our bookstore , they can find titles from all of these providers in one place .
i think it ’ s a great opportunity for us . " it is hard to predict how readers will respond to e-books in the future .
some in the industry are keeping an eye on the us market , where e-books already account for almost ten percent of total sales .
whether germany will follow that trend is hard to say , but many germans are already making the move to e-books .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .

police arrested environmental activists , who claim they were n't involved . a demonstration in a moscow suburb turned violent wednesday night as 100 people threw stones and smoke bombs at the local town hall to protest against the razing of the local forest , moscow regional police said thursday .
russian television reports showed the administration building in khimki surrounded by smoke and broken glass after a permitted rally in which hundreds of people denounced plans to put a new highway through the local forest .
police say a gang of 90 unidentified suspects met up there after the rally .
" they shouted slogans in support of the khimki forest .
shots were fired and glass bottles were thrown , " yevgeny gildeyev , spokesman for the moscow police , told echo of moscow radio .
khimki police also said the unidentified men spray-painted " save russian forests " all over the building 's facade .
when police arrived on the scene , no one was to be found , according to gildeyev .
" we have information that -lsb- the protesters -rsb- went to the station and left for moscow , " he said .
activists detained police detained nine environmental activists who have lived in the forest in recent weeks to protest plans to raze it .
the activists maintained they had played no role in the attacks , which they assert were committed by extremists .
" i am truly disappointed that extremists and provocateurs are more and more mixing themselves up with the true ecologists and genuine defenders of the khimki forest , " russian mp anton belyakov from the a just russia party told echo of moscow .
" i am sure that the police will be able to see which ones are trying to destabilize the situation under cover of protecting the khimki forest , " he added .
the new moscow-saint petersburg highway planned through the forest is intended to relieve chronic traffic congestion in the area .
the khimki forest has been a volatile topic since the plans were announced .
a local journalist who reported on the issue was beaten and left brain-damaged in 2008 .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

yet experts warn that short-term contracts threaten stable employment . despite a marginal seasonal rise in germany 's unemployment rate , the labor market is getting back on track , according to germany 's federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- in nuremberg .
the ba announced a 0.1 percent rise in unemployment for the month of july , raising national joblessness to 7.6 percent .
" the german economy is on the path to recovery .
the state of the labor market has continued to improve , " said ba chairman frank-juergen weise .
more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .
in june , unemployment shrank in germany by 88,000 down to 3.15 million .
another study conducted by the bertelsmann foundation predicted a rising demand for engineers and nurses in coming years .
they said there will soon be more open jobs than applicants in the fields of research , service and healthcare .

meanwhile , 800,000 jobs for people with limited or no professional qualifications are set to disappear , and work in construction , mining and clothing sectors will continue to be outsourced overseas .
a division of personnel the ba also stated that the number of short-term contractual labor positions had steadily increased , accounting for the apparent stabilization of the job market .

"
detlef wetzel , second in command at ig metall , also leveled criticism that contractual labor was " driving out more and more stable positions " and creating a work culture of " hiring and firing . "
he warned that the use of lower-paid , short-term contracts would divide companies ' personnel between those with long-term and those with short-term contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 29.07.2010 germany praises china during human rights talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has been trying to improve its human rights image german diplomats have given the thumbs up to efforts by china to improve the social and economic standing of chinese citizens .
the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .

the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said .

bands and indigenous musicians from around the world gather here every year in july . unlike so many music festivals which squeeze visitors into industrial concert venues , the rainforest world music festival allows music lovers to enjoy its loud rhythms in the heart of the one of the world 's oldest rain forests of the malaysian borneo jungle : in the sarawak cultural village , a living museum showcasing the heritage and history of the iban , bidayuh , orang ulu , penan and other ethnic groups . the magic of this festival is that it invites music lovers to choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debu -lrb- indonesia -rrb- performing on the first day of the festival from a variety of daytime workshops and interactive ethnomusicology lectures in the afternoon , where performing artists of similar instruments or interests are brought together to demonstrate their craft and find a common musical voice .
" the instruments that we have here are mostly made of wood and bamboo , " an official at the dewan lagenda said .
" the material used comes from the jungle .
that is what the rainforest festival is all about .
we make use of what we have in our jungle to make instruments .
the instrument that i have with us now is called pratuon ’ k " . the workshops are the real heart of the rainforest world music festival .
held at locations like the iban longhouse or the dewan lagenda , visitors sit next to each other , legs folded or outstretched , on floors made from strips of wood .
the enthusiasm is contagious and before long the crowd is drawn into the musicians ’ passionate performances , clapping along to their soulful rhythms and vibrant beats . today , the legendary former headhunters of malaysian borneo live peaceful agrarian lives , but they still like playing the traditional tunes they did when the headhunters returned with the head of the enemy . the 13th rainforest world music festival held this month featured 20 performers from countries as diverse as china , indonesia , bulgaria , canada , france and portugal and attracting around 20,000 spectators from around the globe .
austrian nanophysicist ille gebeshuber was one of them .
" i am a university professor of physics at the university kebangsaan malaysia .
once i was at a bookstore and i saw a book about the 501 things that should be done before you die , and one of those things is to visit the rainforest word music festival " . bildunterschrift : bisserov sisters -lrb- bulgaria -rrb- , rainforest world music festival in sarawak for the musicians , the festival recognized by unesco represents a unique opportunity to come into contact with new instruments and techniques , explains clemont bazin from the french band minuit guibolles .
" the first thing that amazed me when i arrived here was the variety of instruments that i discovered - that i think everybody is discovering - especially during the workshops , because you can see everything from chinese or japanese bongos to the steel pan .
there is really a variety of traditional instruments " . after the workshops , the heavens opened up .
thunder and heavy rain accompanied most of the evening performances .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 29.07.2010 pakistan is less than surprised by wikileaks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was pakistan involved in the attack on india 's embassy in kabul in 2008 ?
the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan militant leader jalaluddin haqqani " they are speaking to the haqqani brothers .
they say it openly .
the americans know it .
the whole world knows it .
so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isi director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- with prime minister gilani in pakistan itself , the leaks have also not led to an open debate about the country 's afghanistan policy yet - something kamran shafi regrets .
" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .

so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .

it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .

even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .

conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

unesco says that project can take place without a threat to the status of germany ’ s world-famous lorelei rock . world heritage body unesco has agreed that plans for a bridge near to a favorite german landmark can go ahead without damaging the area 's status .
the proposed engineering project , near to the town of saint goarshausen , is close to the world-famous lorelei rock – centerpiece of the upper middle rhine valley world heritage site .
the picturesque promontory soars 132-meters above one of the most dangerous parts of the rhine .
it is named after a mythical siren who , according to folklore , lured ship captains to their death against the rocky river floor at its base .
the proposal to build a bridge has sparked intense debate about whether the structure would violate the site 's prestigious unesco world-heritage listing .
critics warned there would be considerable environmental destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rock is named after a siren who lured ships onto rocks however , the panel at the 34th annual world heritage meeting in brasilia agreed that the concept of the bridge was compatible with lorelei 's world heritage designation .
detailed plans needed according to the german state of rhineland-palatinate 's economics ministry , a detailed plan will have to be submitted for the bridge project to retain unesco approval for the area .
" we wanted both .
world heritage status and a bridge , " said state transport minister hendrik hering .
" rhineland palatinate can finally plan , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden lost its status last year , over a bridge project unesco wanted to see further plans to ensure the bridge was " visually acceptable and that it complies with the exceptional universal values of a world heritage site , " the state government said .
there are currently no bridges or tunnels across the rhine on the 85 kilometer -lrb- 52 mile -rrb- stretch between koblenz and mainz , where the lorelei lies .
the entire portion of the rhine valley between koblenz and bingen has enjoyed world heritage status since 2002 .
the bridge project is the second recent german controversy for unesco .
the first also involved a bridge project , this time across the elbe , near the historic heart of dresden which lost its status last year .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

" kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .

this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

in its second year of operation , the vaults still have space . the snow cover on the mountainside above the settlement of longyearbyen , around 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- from the north pole , melts to a large extent in summer .
but much of the earth below remains frozen .
the permafrost is one of the main reasons why this spot , 130 meters above sea level , was chosen to house the planet 's " deep freezer " for crop seeds . in 2008 , the bunker in the frosty interior of this arctic mountain , christened the " global seed vault , " initiated by the norwegian government and now run by the global crop diversity trust , was officially opened .
since then , more than half a million seed samples have been stored in what the organizers consider to be the " safest place in the world . " though workmen are drilling inside the 100-meter long tunnel , which leads down to the triple-vault , and shifting permafrost has damaged the facility 's entrance , there 's no danger to the hundreds of thousands of seeds stored inside , according to roland von bothmer , a professor of plant breeding and plant genetics at the swedish university of agriculture . safe from catastrophes , wars and climate change the information about the seeds stored here is generally available on the internet .

we register them and put the box in the seed vault . " it 's important for the vault to protect duplicates , which could be returned to their owners if the originals were to be lost in the event of a disaster , von bothmer said , pointing out that landslides , earthquakes and civil war could all result in the loss of important crop material . refrigeration equipment inside the central storage hall works to push the temperature down to -18 degrees celsius -lrb- -0.4 degrees f -rrb- - the ideal temperature to preserve the seeds for hundreds of years .
seeds of more than a third of the world 's existing varieties of cultivated plants have already been deposited in the vault . " we have around 520,000 seed samples in this vault , " von bothmer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.07.2010 proposal for one-state solution gains favor among israelis and palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is facing major obstacles in its efforts to create a palestinian state the idea of a single state solution to the israeli-palestinian problem is gaining renewed currency with a twist : this time around the proposition is supported not only by palestinians but also by israeli right-wingers . analysts say debate in israel as well as among palestinians about a new approach to middle east peace involving a one-state solution reflects a sense on both sides of the arab-israeli divide that us-sponsored efforts to create a palestinian state alongside israel are likely to fail .
even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

even though support for a one-state solution is by no stretch of the imagination universally accepted among the israeli right , it also signals a realization that israel is increasingly paying a heavy diplomatic and political price for the stalemate in the negotiations and needs to produce fresh ideas .
growing support for a one-state solution was likely to figure in deliberations on thursday at an arab foreign ministers ' meeting in cairo .
the participants agreed in principle to direct peace talks between israel and the palestinians , however officials said the timing and conditions would be left up to palestinian president mahmud abbas to decide .
in the past he has maintained that such talks can only be revived once israel agrees to an independent palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza that includes east jerusalem and a halt to further settlement activity .
abbas has said he would support a one-state solution if indirect israeli-palestinians talks under the auspices of us special envoy george mitchell fail to bring about an independent state .
the us and israeli demands are supported by the european union .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met abbas in amman on tuesday to persuade him to move from the proximity talks to direct negotiations .
pressure for direct talks palestinian officials say the us has exerted considerable pressure on abbas to accept renewed direct negotiations , warning that his refusal could prompt president barack obama to disengage from the peace process .
the officials said mitchell had cautioned that this would mean that the us would have less leverage in persuading israel to halt its settlement activity .
" abbas is caught between a rock and a hard place .
engaging in direct talks with israel without significant israeli gestures could amount to political suicide , " one official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab leaders are not opposed to a one-state solution analysts say the us pressure poses a problem not only for abbas but also for arab leaders .
moderate arab leaders , they say , may instinctively feel that the revival of the notion of a one-state solution - first floated in the 1980s by moderate palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh , who argued that palestinians by accepting israeli citizenship would ultimately have a demographic majority in the israeli state because of their higher birth rate - would in the long run produce a more favorable result for the palestinians .
that instinct , however , is likely to be offset by worries about the impact a breakdown in the israeli-palestinian peace process may have on us-arab relations at a time that concern , particularly in the gulf , is mounting about iran 's nuclear ambitions .
talks on more talks " while welcoming any opportunity for real negotiations , we should remain skeptical of short-term expectations presented as potential breakthroughs , but that end up being little more than delaying or diversionary tactics , cruel mirages in the desert .
the emphasis on the need to shift to direct talks , and to transcend the proximity talks now taking place , represents the triumph of procedure over substance , " says prominent jordanian-palestinian commentator rami khouri .
privately , arab and palestinian officials concede that little is likely to change in extended indirect talks , but they express hope that the obama administration , not wanting to admit failure , may as yet pressure israel to at least halt the settlements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas , left , and mubarak want proximity talks to be extended palestine liberation organization executive committee member hannah amireh said arab leaders would back a proposal put forward by abbas and egyptian president hosni mubarak to ask that the proximity talks be extended until early september .
" there is a consensus that the palestinian authority should not enter into direct talks until israel commits to a halt in settlement construction and provocations in jerusalem and abides by international law , " amireh said .
one state or no state ?
proponents of a two-state solution warn that without tangible progress in the peace talks , the window of opportunity for creating a palestinian state alongside israel will close , leaving the one-state solution as the only option remaining on the table - an option they caution bears in it the seeds for future conflict with palestinians , demanding once they achieve a demographic minority that the state be secular rather than jewish in character .
" the -lrb- israeli -rrb- right is not talking about a neutral ‘ state of all its citizens ' with no identity , nor about ‘ israstine ' with a flag showing a crescent and a shield of david , " says noam sheizaf , a journalist for the liberal israeli daily ha 'aretz , who has written extensively about the debate in israel .
" as envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations , " he added .
in recent statements and articles former israeli defense minister moshe arens and knesseth speaker reuven rivlin have advocated making israel and palestine one state by legally incorporating the west bank into israel .
" we are already a bi-national state and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
the minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you ca n't argue with facts , " arens said in a recent article he penned for ha 'aretz .
" israeli sovereignty over judea and samaria would not be the end of the state of israel , nor would it mean the end of democratic governance in israel .
it would , however , pose a serious challenge to israeli society .
but that is equally true for the other options being suggested for dealing with the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he added .
palestinians agree .
a recent palestinian poll revealed that more than half of the palestinians endorse the arens proposal , even though it involved only the west bank , leaving the gaza strip 's 1.5 million palestinians to fend for themselves . emily amrousi , a former spokesperson for the settlers , has taken the idea one step further by participating in meetings between settlers and palestinians to discuss a one-state solution " in which the children of settlers and the children of palestinians will be bused to school together . "
amrousi and other settler leaders admit that their endorsement of the one-state solution does not constitute a change of heart but another way of securing continued control of the west bank .
" if every path seems to reach an impasse , usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo , " said uri elitzur , another former settler leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 29.07.2010 german isaf general calls wikileaks document release ' a crime ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general blotz , right , said the leak was ' really irresponsible ' brigadier general josef blotz has criticized the recent online leak of 92,000 mostly classified documents on the afghan conflict .
he said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger . a top german general and isaf spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' website on thursday for last week 's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in afghanistan .
" i take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents , " brigadier general josef blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from afghanistan to the bundeswehr operations command center near the german city of potsdam .
" it was extremely irresponsible and , basically , it was a crime . "
blotz did n't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old , but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians .
" the classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our isaf troops , " he warned from the isaf base in the afghan capital kabul .
" moreover , they can endanger the lives of many ordinary afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with isaf forces or afghan security troops , and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents . "
however , the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited , saying the information released " would only bowl over people who had n't picked up a newspaper for the past three years . "
armed and ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has pointed to equipment shortages blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to german troops on the ground , saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained .
the general dismissed claims from the german parliament 's commissioner for bundeswehr affairs , helmut koenigshaus , that the equipment levels for german soldiers had become " a drama . "
koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks , camp beds , as well as live and blank ammunition , saying some troops were feeling neglected .
blotz described this assertion as " at least completely disproportionate , " saying that while soldiers would always like more , the situation " in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which i have seen in the newspapers in the past few days . "
however , the criticism has become reciprocal , with koenigshaus ' free democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the bundeswehr 's corner in berlin .
" the job of commissioner for bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution ; it 's to address the soldiers ' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public , " free democrat defense expert elke hoff said after the video conference .
" however , it is not part of isaf 's job to publicly criticize the commissioner 's important work .
our defense minister -lrb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg -rrb- should make this crystal clear , and should perhaps consider personal consequences . "
" deliberate progress " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest isaf troop contributor blotz also told reporters that the isaf mission in afghanistan was progressing well .
even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon , he spoke of " deliberate progress " , military terminology for piecemeal improvement , in the country .
he also said the impression of a growing taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial , because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the nato-led forces did n't always patrol .
" we simply had to move into such areas , there was no alternative to it , " blotz said .
" and because you have more combat action now , the media often concludes that we 're confronted with a taliban offensive , but that 's not the case . "
blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots , with the country as a whole gradually pacifying .
he pointed out that seven of every ten isaf losses are incurred solely in the kandahar province .
in the long term , he said , the target is still to hand over security tasks to the afghan military and police .
" building up the afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the isaf command , " he said .
" we need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops .
from what we see right now , it should be possible to complete this task by 2014 , due to the remarkable progress already made in this field .
however , blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by afghan president hamid karzai , not isaf , and also said that even after a security handover took place , some western troops would stay in afghanistan for non-combat purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 29.07.2010 state government moves to keep extremists out of pre-schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pre-school in barkow needed 15,000 euros to stay open after a member of a far-right party nearly took over a cash-strapped pre-school in northern germany , the state government moved quickly to stop it from happening again .
but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility .

meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .
the official memorial for the victims of the tragedy is to take place next saturday in duisburg .
german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff are both expected to attend .
however , the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland , who has faced several calls to resign over his handling of the event , will not be present .
sauerland said he wanted to avoid upsetting the family and friends of the victims with his presence .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

" aldi is only able to offer really low prices by its limited range , through which is generates massive advantages in purchasing , " queck said of the chain , which is also known as trader joe 's in the united states . the discount concept has been so successful that it is responsible for some 44 percent of national grocery sales , according to germany 's gfk market research group .
though it shares the no-frills sector with a number of competitors , aldi 's network of 4,400 outlets makes it hands-down the largest discounter in germany .
planet retail estimates the nation is served by a total of 16,300 discount grocery stores . no secret to aldi 's success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is an indirect decendent of aldi 's no-frills concept " it is a very german phenomenon , " queck said , pointing to germans ' fondness of getting a good deal on food , clothes or electronics - all of which at some point make it onto aldi 's bi-weekly flyer of special sale items . divided into aldi north , which was managed by theo albrecht , and aldi south , which was controlled by his brother karl , total revenues for the aldi brand are estimated to be between 34 billion euros and 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion and $ 69 billion -rrb- . " there are very few people who have left their mark on an entire branch of the economy ; that 's what theo albrecht did , " stefan genth , head of the german retail federation hde , said in a statement .
" the low-cost philosophy has become an integral part of the retail market . " but the influence of aldi 's business model is n't limited to retail sales .
it can be seen at no-frills airlines like ryanair and easyjet , the ubiquitous 1-euro stores that saturate city fringes , call-around numbers to lower communications costs , inexpensive clothing lines and discount electronics stores with low prices and limited selection . but queck said there is no secret behind the success of low-cost operations - whether they are airlines that deliver passengers without serving drinks or grocery stores with a limited range of unbranded products . " it has become very popular for all parts of the german society to shop at aldi , " he said .
" it 's simply because consumers gradually have found that products and product quality is actually very good and that prices are significantly lower than other places .

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "

but for the moment , sales figures for e-books in germany are not reflecting this trend . yesterday , the world 's largest online book retailer , amazon.com , announced it was launching a newer version of the kindle , at an even cheaper price - $ 139 -lrb- 107 euros -rrb- .
the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "
the second is that " for a long time we did n't have an adequate reading device , " although " now we have the ipad , and we know that this year there will be several more coming out of the major suppliers ' development labs . " lack of compatible devices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's newly-announced kindle will sell for $ 139 -lrb- wifi only -rrb- or $ 189 -lrb- wifi + 3g -rrb- the slow take-up of e-books among german consumers is only slowed down further by the lack of interchangeable e-readers available .
for example , e-books available for the apple ipad or the amazon kindle are not yet compatible with each another . " unfortunately , we 're in a situation where the big suppliers use their own formats , " schild said in an interview with deutsche welle . " so that their e-books can only be read using their readers - which for the consumer is obviously not a very attractive scenario , because it means that if you switch to a new reader , you also have to buy a whole new library .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 29.07.2010 france launches long-delayed online anti-piracy agency hadopi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hadopi aims to counter online piracy a new french law creates a " three strikes " rule to go after those who illegally download copyrighted content .
but a brussels-based eu digital rights expert says it will be ineffective in protecting intellectual property . the french government on tuesday announced the official launch of hadopi , the government agency designed to promote creative works on the internet and to counter online piracy .
one of the law 's most controversial provisions created a " three strikes " system where , in addition to possible fines and even jail time , a person caught illegally downloading copyrighted material three times would be blacklisted from receiving internet service for up to a year . the law , which has been in the works since 2008 , has gone through various iterations , including surviving a constitutional council of france ruling .
the court decision required judicial review before terminating someone 's internet connection .
deutsche welle spoke with joe mcnamee of edri , a european digital rights organization based in brussels about the hadopi going into effect . deutsche welle : what does the start of hadopi mean ? joe mcnamee : it means that it 's round 53 in the governments versus ipr -lrb- intellectual property rights -rrb- infringement game of whack-a-mole is ready to start .
and it means that this new bureaucracy is going to take some time working out that two years after being announced , that it 's probably not going to be able to do what it set up to do in the first place . how was hadopi going to go about encouraging legal content and fighting unauthorized access to copyrighted material online ? well , over time , particularly because it was set up due to content industry , or old content industry lobbying , the focus on producing legal content online became less and less significant , and the sanctions side of hadopi became more and more important . the french government ha said that hadopi 's infrastructure has been set up .
does that mean that people will begin facing prosecution under the three strikes provision and possible lose access to the internet ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy championed the hadopi law that 's the plan .
what 's going to happen is that through some legally dubious means , ip addresses are going to be collected online .
the people who were registered by the internet provider as using the ip address at that time will be told they broke the law .
and then through the fullness of time they may get a second , similar warning .
and then ultimately leading to this potential disconnection . of course we already see peer-to-peer networks increasingly moving towards encryption , and this was exactly what the british secret service warned against during the discussions of the digital economy bill in the uk .
they said what was going to happen if this type of approach was adopted in the uk was that if there was more encryption then the job of the secret service would become more difficult . these measures by governments are always a year or two or three behind technological development .
it 's likely that by the time they get around to actually warning anybody for the third time that people will have found alternative means of accessing the content that they want . even the content industry itself is beginning to say that there is more of an issue with streaming illegal content than with peer-to-peer sharing .
that means they already see two different movements away from the type of infringements that hadopi was aiming to tackle in the first place . it seems that there 's never been a clear explanation as to how a person could be kept off the internet after the third strike .
essentially , it seems impossible . yes .
i always think of the american smart bombs when i see these proposals coming up , because it 's basically the opposite of the smart bomb .
it 's not a targeted response .
it 's dropped on the problem and causes a lot of collateral damage to legitimacy of freedoms .
the only thing that you can be sure that it wo n't do is to solve the problem that it was intended to solve . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bands and indigenous musicians from around the world gather here every year in july . unlike so many music festivals which squeeze visitors into industrial concert venues , the rainforest world music festival allows music lovers to enjoy its loud rhythms in the heart of the one of the world 's oldest rain forests of the malaysian borneo jungle : in the sarawak cultural village , a living museum showcasing the heritage and history of the iban , bidayuh , orang ulu , penan and other ethnic groups . the magic of this festival is that it invites music lovers to choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debu -lrb- indonesia -rrb- performing on the first day of the festival from a variety of daytime workshops and interactive ethnomusicology lectures in the afternoon , where performing artists of similar instruments or interests are brought together to demonstrate their craft and find a common musical voice .
" the instruments that we have here are mostly made of wood and bamboo , " an official at the dewan lagenda said .
" the material used comes from the jungle .
that is what the rainforest festival is all about .
we make use of what we have in our jungle to make instruments .
the instrument that i have with us now is called pratuon ’ k " . the workshops are the real heart of the rainforest world music festival .
held at locations like the iban longhouse or the dewan lagenda , visitors sit next to each other , legs folded or outstretched , on floors made from strips of wood .
the enthusiasm is contagious and before long the crowd is drawn into the musicians ’ passionate performances , clapping along to their soulful rhythms and vibrant beats . today , the legendary former headhunters of malaysian borneo live peaceful agrarian lives , but they still like playing the traditional tunes they did when the headhunters returned with the head of the enemy . the 13th rainforest world music festival held this month featured 20 performers from countries as diverse as china , indonesia , bulgaria , canada , france and portugal and attracting around 20,000 spectators from around the globe .
austrian nanophysicist ille gebeshuber was one of them .

" the first thing that amazed me when i arrived here was the variety of instruments that i discovered - that i think everybody is discovering - especially during the workshops , because you can see everything from chinese or japanese bongos to the steel pan .
there is really a variety of traditional instruments " . after the workshops , the heavens opened up .
thunder and heavy rain accompanied most of the evening performances .
but what is a rain forest music festival without some rain ? the grand finale featured all 20 bands together on stage , each performing about a minute of their music and then jamming all together .
memories of the three-day world music extravaganza blurred and came together , and the audience was determined to be back again for the next rainforest world music festival . author : helena de gouveia editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .

he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .

this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .

a preliminary investigation said event organizers and the city of duisburg should accept responsibilty . hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , has called on the lord mayor of the western german city of duisburg to accept moral responsibility for the deaths of 21 people at a stampede at the love parade techno festival on saturday . in a statement in thursday 's edition of the regional paper rheinische post , kraft said adolf sauerland " and those responsible in the city government will ultimately have to take political responsibility . " kraft 's statements have been interpreted by german media as an indirect call for sauerland 's resignation .
meanwhile , a group of 150 young protesters gathered in duisburg thursday morning , demanding that sauerland step down . preliminary report finds city and organizers to blame criticism against sauerland has increased in the last 24 hours , after a preliminary investigative report stated wednesday that organizers of the love parade failed to adhere to their own safety concept and that the city government , which approved their event permit , had been unorganized . ralf jaeger , an interior minister in north rhine-westphalia , presented the report , saying he found it " outrageous " that the city and the event 's organizers had attempted to deny their responsibility for the tragedy , as it took place within the festival grounds . he said the continuing police investigation would be focused on finding out why organizers did not implement their own crowd control plans and why the city had approved the love parade 's event permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland is accused of shirking moral responsibility " the organizer of the event is solely responsible for the event location , " said jaeger , adding , " my impression is that , as the crowd control system fell apart , the police took over the role of the organizer in working to protect visitors from being crushed . " " the police attempted to do what the organizers were supposed to do , " said jaeger , adding that a combined police force of 5,300 was present , but organizers were responsible for controling the flow of traffic . unmanned entrance gates caused traffic jam of 20,000 jaeger also spoke of poor organization on the part of city authorities , who approved the event .
he said that the city had only sent its approval of the love parade security concept to police on the morning of the event . in the weeks before the festival , police had expressed to organizers their concern about the use of the tunnel as the sole entrance and exit , north rhine-westphalia police inspector dieter wehe said wednesday . according to the inspector 's chronology of the events , organizers opened the festival grounds shortly after noon , over an hour later than planned .
this led to huge queues as visitors tried to get in . the organizers ' plan for crowd control detailed 24 access gates around the perimeter of the love parade festival grounds .
eight of these gates were found by police to be unmanned and left open when police were asked to disperse a growing crowd on a ramp leading to the festival ground .
this meant thousands more people were able to pour in .
" there was a clear agreement between the organizers and the police to close all points of entry at the same time as the operation designed to disperse the crowd began , " said wehe .
" this would prevent more people reaching the crowded ramp . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger wants to know why the event organizer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't follow his own plans organizers lost control ; asked police to step in festival organizers asked police at 3:30 p.m. to step in and conduct crowd control due to the mass build-up of people at the tunnel entrance . wehe explained that police " have a philosophy of holding back at peaceful festivals " and that they had not stepped in earlier , as the task of controling the flow of visitors was the organizers ' reponsibility . at 3:46 p.m. , organizers ordered crowd-control staff to close the access gates and prevent more festival-goers from entering the tunnel .
this order was never implemented , according to wehe .
additional festival-goers then entered the scene through gaps in the fences created to allow in ambulances .
jaeger cited an eyewitness report that stated that the police had formed a line in order to keep new visitors from entering the tunnel , but that the people had pushed their way through , forcing the officers to give up their efforts .
suffocated in the crush at 5:02 p.m. the crowd broke through the police fence in front of the ramp over the entranceway , and several of the festival-goers climbed to the top of the ramp , flashing the " victory " sign to those below .
the 14 victims who died on the scene were suffocated when a mass of people charged the ramp stairs .
without the successful work of paramedics , jaeger said , the magnitude of the tragedy would have been much greater . bildunterschrift : loveparade victims were suffocated when crowds charged ramp stairs memorial services the first memorial ceremony took place wednesday in the city muenster for three female students , two of them spanish exchange students , who were killed in the crush .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

the company says the e-book reader will start shipping to its american customers at the end of august . this aggressive move further into the e-book market comes just a week after amazon.com also announced that it had sold more digital books than hardbacks in the second quarter of 2010 . from april to june , the company sold 43 percent more digital books for its kindle handheld device than hardback books , nearly three years after the electronic format became available .
total e-book sales tripled from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 . however , despite the rapid growth in the united states , in germany , one of the continent 's biggest book markets , uptake of e-books has been much slower . around 25,000 e-book titles are listed on the libreka site - an online e-book shop of the german booksellers ’ association .
however , compared to the 1.2 million printed books available on the german market , this is a very small number .
it reflects the current reality of the state of the german e-book market . according to roland schild , the ceo of libreka , there are two main reasons why the german e-book market share is still well under one percent .
the first is that the range of e-book bestsellers is " still not wide enough . "

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .

the decision , in favour of a czech brewery , is the culmination of more than a decade 's legal wrangling . europe 's highest court ruled thursday that brewing giant anheuser-busch could not register " budweiser " as a trademark for its beer .
the decision was a major a victory for czech brewer budejovicky budvar , which already had a prior claim to the name .
" anheuser-busch may not register the word ' budweiser ' as a -lrb- eu -rrb- trademark for beer , " the luxembourg-based european court of justice said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech beer is registered as budweiser in several states multinational anheuser-busch applied to register its budweiser brand , on sale in the united states for more than a century , in 1996 . budejovicky budvar challenged the application three years later , arguing that it had already registered the name for its beers in germany , austria , italy and the benelux countries .
name describes origins the name literally means " from budweis " , referring to the german form of the czech place name budejkovice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budweiser literally means " from the town of budweis " in 2005 , the eu 's office for harmonisation in the internal market trademark body -lrb- ohim -rrb- ruled that the czech trademark was valid , meaning anheuser-busch could not register budweiser as an eu brand .
the court of justice ruling followed anheuser-busch 's unsuccessful appeal against ohim 's decision at the european general court in march 2009 .
it stated that none of the grounds for the appeal were valid , and that the czech firm had registered documents correctly .
anheuser-busch is based in the us , but is owned by belgian-brazilian multinational inbev .
the firm can still hold the trademark within individual eu states , rather than across the trading block as a whole .

but the government is treading on thin ice . in an effort to keep right-wing extremists out of early-childhood education , the state government of mecklenburg-west pomerania has ordered all heads of state-funded pre-schools to swear allegiance to the german constitution .
the order , which takes effect august 1 , came after a scandal involving a pre-school in the tiny village of bartow , population 550 .
the village needed 15,000 euros to keep the school running when mattias schubert , a father of seven , offered to run the school for free .
it was soon discovered that schubert is a member of the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the german government accuses of racism and anti-semitism .
the town council quickly rejected schubert 's offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwesig said children should grow up in freedom and democracy it was the first known case of its kind in mecklenburg-west pomerania , but state minister of social affairs manuela schwesig said she wanted to act before " we want our children to grown up in freedom and democracy , and not in the shadow of extremists , " she said .
party platforms the government says the order would not affect just the far-right , but the npd is clearly the main target .
the party openly rejects the german constitution , saying it was imposed by the victorious western allies after world war ii .
despite its extreme platforms , numerous attempts to ban the npd have failed .
in addition , the party won 7.3 percent of the vote in the last state election in mecklenburg-west pomerania in 2006 .
udo pastoers , chair of the npd group in the state parliament , said he doubted the order was legal , and accused the government of exploiting the issue to distract people from unemployment and budget deficits .
" you should n't forget that here in mecklenburg-west pomerania , the old east german network of educators is in charge of a very high number of educational facilities , including kindergartens , " he said .
" and nobody in the government here seems to have a problem with that , although their political objectives are highly doubtful . "
bildunterschrift : the npd openly rejects the german constitution , but attempts to ban it have failed limited effect pastoers also accused the state of overreacting to a small , isolated case in a tiny village .
anne-rose wergin , who heads an anti-extremism group lola for lulu , said she admits the danger of pre-schools being infiltrated by the npd on a massive scale has been low so far .
" but if you consider the impact that such a case would have in a small village , one should really take it seriously , " she said .
" kindergarten staff have enough on their plate to deal with some of the kids ' parents who come to them with clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes .
we need more well-trained educators who can handle this and who can serve as inspiring democratic models themselves - you ca n't do this with npd people in charge . "
wergin added , however , that parents have a much stronger influence on their children 's development than educators , meaning the state 's decree may do little to stop the spread of right-wing extremism .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan militant leader jalaluddin haqqani " they are speaking to the haqqani brothers .
they say it openly .
the americans know it .
the whole world knows it .
so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the americans still have to operate through the pakistani military .
they are the major stakeholders .
without them , they can not really progress far on afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isi director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- with prime minister gilani in pakistan itself , the leaks have also not led to an open debate about the country 's afghanistan policy yet - something kamran shafi regrets .
" there should be input from all over , it should not just be left to the security establishment .
i firmly believe that an open debate is extremely necessary .
it 's not happening because the pakistan army is in a preponderant position and they do what they like . "
especially at times like these , when pressure from abroad is increasing , pakistan 's civilian politicians are not likely to take on the army and the intelligence agencies .

the leaked us intelligence documents about the afghanistan war have put the role of pakistan 's intelligence agency , the isi , in allegedly guiding and supporting taliban attacks in afghanistan back in the spotlight . british prime minister david cameron , who is on a visit to india this week , said pakistan should not be allowed to " look both ways " on afghanistan , and to export terror .
afghan president hamid karzai even called for western military action against terrorist sanctuaries outside of afghanistan , clearly referring to pakistan .
the pakistani government continues to dismiss all the allegations as baseless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister david cameron with india 's manmohan singh on thursday open secrets the general sense in the country is that the leaked documents do n't really contain any new information , says kamran shafi , a columnist for the renowned newspaper dawn : " we 've seen it all before .
we know most of the stuff that has come out .
it seems to be a very low-level leak .
there is no ' smoking gun ' per se .
there is just one new thing : that the isi was also part of a plot to assassinate karzai - well , i do n't know about that .
even there , there is no proof . "
that the pakistani military has been on good terms with the taliban and their allies in afghanistan has been obvious for long , he adds .
after all , the pakistani army and the isi have openly offered to help start a dialogue with the militants .

they say it openly .
the americans know it .

so what is the great secret about the isi or our security establishment having links with the taliban ? "
conspiracy theories pakistani observers have highlighted the coincidence of the leak with increasing pressure on pakistan to do more against the haqqani network 's bases in north waziristan , for example .
many in pakistan believe that the documents were actually deliberately " leaked " for this very reason .
" we 've got a very strong brigade of conspiracy theorists , " says shafi , " who think everything that happens , happens because pakistan is the target .
in this case , most certainly not !
in this case it is the united states and nato and isaf and the way they have fought the war in afghanistan . "
no other option for the west despite the strong statements by karzai and cameron , pakistanis do n't think there will be a long-term impact on pakistan 's relations with other countries , says ayesha siddiqa , a security analyst in islamabad .

more jobs for skilled workers ; outsourcing of unskilled labor experts estimate that of the 39,000 residents who began collecting unemployment benefits in july , 10,000 to 20,000 were seasonally-related , mostly students who were finishing school and heading on to university or vocational training programs in autumn .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .

the comments came from the sixth round of bilateral talks on human rights . german politicians have acknowledged china 's progress in granting its citizens more social and economic rights in recent years , in the sixth round of their bilateral dialogue on human rights .
the german government 's commissioner for human rights and humanitarian aid , markus loening of the free democrats , said he was pleased with the first day of talks with the chinese delegation , which included representatives from various ministries and a high-ranking judge from the supreme people 's court .
loening emphasized that the discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere , even over controversial issues such as the death penalty and criticism of china 's frequent use of capital punishment .
" the chinese delegation said it had the political goal to abolish the death penalty in the end , " loening said .
" they did not say when .
but we talked about the number of executions , and they explained … they 've reduced the number of crime types for which the death penalty can be given .
" china has also introduced a type of death penalty where the sentence is suspended for two years .
and if no crime is committed within these two years , then the death penalty will be turned into a lifelong sentence .
and that obviously has reduced the number executions considerably , " he added .
few concrete results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's leading executioner of prisoners critics of the german-chinese human rights dialog have often said the forum has never yielded any tangible results , and that , in recent years , it has served as somewhat of a fig leaf for a major expansion of economic relations between the two countries .
marianne heuwagen , who heads the german section of the human rights watch pressure group , said the dialog could be more useful if the chinese were pinned down to concrete measures and timetables .
" in the past we 've seen only little progress in human rights in china , so the critics are right , " heuwagen said .
" therefore it 's important for the bilateral dialogue to set concrete benchmarks which can be measured as time goes by .
that applies to the death penalty issue .
" china could also be asked to set up a timetable for ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights .
those could be some of the most urgent goals , and the progress made in these fields must be measured in the future . "
credit where it 's due however , loening said it was already a clear signal of progress that criticism of selected human rights issues in china , including the treatment of lawyers and minorities , could now be addressed more openly at the forum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under premier wen jiabao , china has taken great leaps forward he added that in order to have a constructive dialog , china deserved some praise for the progress it has made towards granting citizens more social and educational freedoms and rights .
" it 's also important to acknowledge the way that china has fought poverty , and to acknowledge the way that literacy has spread in china .
some 90 percent of the chinese are now able to read and write , " loening said .
" better access to food , water and housing clearly has been a priority of the government .
hundreds of millions of chinese have left poverty over the past decades , and that is something that we should not ignore . "
the german-chinese human rights dialog has never been completely without friction .
in 2007 , for instance , the chinese government decided to suspend its participation in the forum after german chancellor angela merkel met with the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .
human rights talks were resumed in the autumn of 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 29.07.2010 far-right npd ups ante with media offensive in eastern german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters attempt to stage rallies in cities around germany five new newspapers have gone into print in the eastern state of thuringia with the aim of furthering the far-right .
the much-maligned national democratic party , widely seen as a neo-nazi group , is behind the move . far-right nationalists in the german state of thuringia are seeking to reach a wider audience by founding five new newspapers in the region .
the worrying move by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is aimed at capturing more voters .
the publications purport to address regional issues , running headlines such as " is erfurt broke ? " , " venturing more democracy , " and " schools are the future . "
but behind this veneer of seemingly harmless headlines lies the npd 's true agenda .
" the npd 's ideology is communicated above all else in these articles , " said stefan heerdegen of the mobile council in thuringia for democracy - against right-wing extremism , based in the state 's capital , erfurt .
" there is always a hostility towards democracy being piggybacked -lsb- in these stories -rsb- , " said heerdegen .
the npd is the official political arm of the right-wing neo-nazi movement in germany .
it is often involved in far-right extremist marches and is widely opposed throughout the country .
there have been numerous attempts to have it banned from german politics .
its existence is permitted through somewhat of a legal loophole .
the party is allowed to operate because its founding documents pledge allegiance to the german constitution , unlike other far-right and far-left parties that have been banned .
racist messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cities regularly try to have npd rallies banned stefan kausch , a political scientist who works with the forum for critical research of right-wing extremism , said " the topics of the articles are connected with the party 's objectives - racist ideologies are repeatedly conveyed . "
an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

an example of this is given in an npd article on municipal finances : " instead of prescribing to the protection of identity , sovereignty and solidarity of germans , " the article reads , " the anti-german political cartel instigates a well-planned policy -lsb- serving the -rsb- interests of foreigners , foreign countries and high finance . "
heerdegen says the far-right party is trying to use the new publications to position itself as the lone voice of political opposition in germany .
" and so these are npd newspapers , not true newspapers in the sense of journalistic seriousness , " he said .
new take , old idea publishing regional newspapers is not new for the far-right .
since 2001 , publications such as the inselboten , a regional paper in mecklenburg-western pomerania , have been in print .
the state 's largest city , rostock , is home to the right-wing rostocker boten , while a far-right newspaper can also be found in the city of trier , in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieschke says the npd papers try to focus on local issues pre-election periods usually see an increase in the number of these far-right publications .
" we have also noticed this -lsb- in the eastern city of -rsb- leipzig , " said kausch .
" however , these publications do n't last . "
two exceptions to the short-lived nature of many right-wing newspapers are the wartburgkreisbote and der rennsteigbote in thuringia .
in its 14th edition the former printed 22,000 copies , according to the npd district council chairman and the paper 's publisher , patrick wieschke .
" the new regional papers are financed in mixed ways , " said wieschke .
the lion 's share comes from the npd 's associations at the state level , but local groups must also pay up , he says .
parliamentary push the npd in thuringia wants to use its five new publications to strengthen its grass-roots movement and create the conditions for entry to state parliament in 2014 , says wieschke .
in 2009 , the party only marginally failed to garner the 5 percent of votes needed for representation .
the right-wing party says it wants to appeal to common voters by focusing on local issues in the hope this will demonstrate some kind of capacity to serve communities .
the front and back sheets of the four-page publications attempt to deal with local issues and differ from paper to paper .
the inner two pages , however , are identical in each of the five publications .
most germans still view the npd as embodying the neo-nazi movement , and the new publications are unlikely to sway voters from these firmly held positions .

critics have accused president nicolas sarkozy of trying to create a scapegoat . french president nicolas sarkozy has ordered the dismantling of 300 illegal camps of romany and traveling folk .
the announcement , which has attracted criticizm from human rights groups , followed crisis talks with ministers in paris on wednesday .
interior minister brice hortefeux said that half of france 's illegal camps would be dismantled in the next three months , and that illegal roma immigrants breaking the law would be immediately deported .
" tax inspectors will be sent to inspect the households of the inhabitants of these illicit and illegal camps because a lot of our compatriots are rightly surprised to see the caravans pulled by certain powerful cars , " he said .
' security ' problems president sarkozy described the " security problems " caused by traveling groups and roma , a week after declaring " war on crime " following riots in different parts of france over a weekend .
roma travelers rioted in the small village of saint-aignan , in the loire valley region of central france , on sunday morning .
armed with hatchets and iron bars , they felled trees and traffic lights , torched cars and attacked the local bakery and police station .
300 soldiers were called in to ensure no more trouble .
sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be " severely punished " and ordered the government to expel all illegal roma immigrants .
the attacks followed the shooting of a 22-year-old man belonging to one of the traveler groups .
his vehicle failed to stop at a police checkpoint , and an officer opened fire .
rioters also torched shops and cars in a suburb of grenoble in southeastern france .
four people were arrested , after attacks not linked to traveling communities .
sarkozy under fire president sarkozy has been accused of stigmatising and failing to distinguish between roma , gypsy and traveling folk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , with an investigation into donations and low poll ratings , is under pressure " he has it in for all roma camps which were illegally established , " said jean-pierre dubois , president of the french league of human rights .
" it is therefore a question of an ethnically-grounded collective penalty .
if you substitute the word ' roma ' for ' jews , ' then you can immediately see where the words of the president lead . "
sarkozy , who rose to prominence as an interior minister who was tough on crime , has also been accused of trying to gain political capital , to divert attention away from the bettencourt scandal , which sees his ump party under investigation for receiving illegal donations from france 's richest woman .
" as happens too often in history , gypsies are once more being made scapegoats by a ruling class tangled up in political and financial scandals , " the gypsy rights association ufat said in a statement .
established communities ethnic roma trace their origins to medieval india .
they have large populations in southeastern europe and an established presence in france , where around 15,000 currently live .
there are around 400,000 gypsies , of which sinti communities are a part , and french-national travelers in the country .

the country is fixing relations with the fund after past problems . ukraine expects to receive the first chunk of a 11.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- loan after agreeing to impose tough austerity measures .
a condition of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- loan is that the country 's government must impose a raft of unpopular measures to reduce its budget deficit .
the measures include increasing gas tariffs and raising the retirement age .
" ukraine will ... diligently meet all the obligations it has taken on , " a statement from the ukrainian government said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yanukovych aimed to fix links with the imf the former soviet republic is recovering from a crippling recession , with the economy shrinking by 15 percent last year .
earlier this year , a 12.5 billion euro funding agreement from 2008 was suspended when ukraine passed a law that raised minimum wages and pensions , despite opposition from the imf .
priority since taking office ukrainian president viktor yanukovych , elected in february , has made restoring relations with the imf a priority since taking office .
" ukraine is emerging from a difficult period during which the economy was severely hit by external shocks and exacerbated by domestic vulnerabilities , " said john lipsky , deputy managing director of the imf .
" the authorities are committed to addressing existing imbalances and putting the economy on a path of durable growth , through important fiscal , energy , and financial sector reforms , " he added .
the imf deal requires ukraine to keep its budget deficit within 5.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and cut it to 3.5 percent next year .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .
" the lack of access to drinking water kills more children than aids , malaria and measles combined . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue planet project campaigned for declaring access to water a human right water shortage and desertification on the rise water shortages and the desertification of agricultural regions used to be almost exclusively africa and asia 's problem - but now europe is facing this problem too .
in southern spain , the desert expands by one kilometer northwards each year . meanwhile , water shortages are the cause of an increasing amount of domestic and international conflicts all around the world , such as between israel and palestine and in india and pakistan .
the problem is made even worse by privatization of water supplies driven by large food companies , which usually leads to higher water costs for consumers . according to maude barlow , founder of the canadian-based blue planet project , people could not have predicted all these problems when the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the un in 1948 .
but she also believes that the increasing shortage of clean water is the worst human rights violation that exists .
her blue planet project advocates the protection and the fair sharing of global water resources , and two years ago it initiated a campaign for a un resolution on the right to water . germany votes in favor supported by 33 countries , it was bolivia that finally presented the un general assembly with a specific proposal for the resolution .
this week , 122 of the 163 un member states present voted for its approval .
the remaining 41 countries - almost exclusively from the industrialized north - abstained from the vote . in particular the united states , canada and great britain attempted to prevent the vote for the resolution .
however , the position of the world 's wealthy northern countries was not as one-sided as it has been on similar topics in the past .
germany voted in favor of the resolution , and its representative peter wittig has distanced himself from the negative stance of the united states and other countries . " germany is committed to the realization of the millennium development goals , including that of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation , " wittig said . " we consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , recognized in article 11 of the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights .

the resolution was approved late yesterday by the united nations general assembly without opposition . although the decision does not make the right to water legally enforceable , it is symbolically important and places more political obligation on national governments .
the resolution highlights how urgent the issue of water shortage is for a growing portion of the world 's population . grim statistics according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , 884 million people around the globe have no access to clean , drinkable water .
almost 2.5 billion people have no access to toilets and other sanitation facilities .
every year , more than two million people die due to a lack of drinking water and diseases caused by consuming polluted water . " diarrhea is the second most important cause of the death of children below the age of five , " said pablo solon , bolivia 's ambassador to the united nations .

she is one of six people whose homes have been chosen to show the play henry & elizabeth from home-performance pioneers signal to noise .
each night of the week the play is being performed in a different house , for an audience of up to 12 people .
so the kitchen , sitting room and one of sally 's bedrooms in her stoke home will be temporarily transformed into a theatre .
" it 's just so unusual , " said sally .
" we saw it in the theatre royal 's summer programme and just knew we wanted to be part of it - we feel really lucky to have been chosen . "
coming to a sitting room near you ...
written and directed by chris goode , henry & elizabeth is described as a " gentle and captivating comedy " .
when hapless henry is defeated by a simple repair job , and long-suffering elizabeth finally snaps , it seems as though it might jeopardise their whole relationship .
and it was the fact that it was written by chris goode which inspired sally to apply .
" we saw a play by him in the drum theatre last year , king pelican , and loved it . "
sally and husband trevor are inviting 10 friends to the show who will stay for supper afterwards .
" we 'll invite the company too and the director and writer if they want to come . "
each performance will be slightly different depending on the house it is being performed in .
as with the company 's previous domestic pieces , such as homemade and at home , some elements of the performance are improvised around each particular home venue and its contents .
the play , which is being brought to the city by the theatre royal plymouth , is a new co-production from signal to noise and northampton 's royal & derngate .
" it promises to be a very special evening , " said sally , " we really ca n't wait . "
